      CHAPTER 37. Sunset.
    </h2>
<p>
<i>The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I
      sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but
      first I pass.
    </p>
<p>
      Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The
      gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes
      down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the
      crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright
      with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel
      that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that I know—not
      gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my
      brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the
      sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!
    </p>
<p>
      Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me,
      so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all
      loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted with the high
      perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most
      malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night—good night!
      (<i>waving his hand, he moves from the window</i>.)
    </p>
<p>
      ’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
      but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
      revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand
      before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match
      itself must needs be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and what I’ve
      willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m demoniac,
      I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only calm to comprehend
      itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered; and—Aye! I
      lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. Now,
      then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s more than ye, ye great
      gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists,
      ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do to
      bullies—Take some one of your own size; don’t pommel <i>me!</i> No, ye’ve
      knocked me down, and I am up again; but <i>ye</i> have run and hidden. Come forth
      from behind your cotton bags! I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s
      compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot
      swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The
      path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is
      grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of
      mountains, under torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle,
      naught’s an angle to the iron way!

      CHAPTER 38. Dusk.
    </h2>
<p>
<i>By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      My soul is more than matched; she’s overmanned; and by a madman!
      Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But he
      drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see his
      impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill I, the
      ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have no knife
      to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over him, he cries;—aye, he would be
      a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below! Oh! I
      plainly see my miserable office,—to obey, rebelling; and worse yet,
      to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would
      shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow wide. The
      hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish
      has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside. I
      would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole clock’s run down; my
      heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.
    </p>
<p>
      [<i>A burst of revelry from the forecastle</i>.]
    </p>
<p>
      Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human
      mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white whale is
      their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward! mark
      the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life. Foremost through
      the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only to
      drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin,
      builded over the dead water of the wake, and further on, hunted by its
      wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills me through! Peace! ye revellers,
      and set the watch! Oh, life! ’tis in an hour like this, with soul beat
      down and held to knowledge,—as wild, untutored things are forced to
      feed—Oh, life! ’tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee!
      but ’tis not me! that horror’s out of me! and with the soft feeling of the
      human in me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand
      by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!

    </p>
<p>
      Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it
      ever since, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a
      laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what
      will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all
      predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor eye
      Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure the
      old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the gift,
      might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon his
      skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, <i>wise</i> Stubb—that’s my title—well,
      Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be
      coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
      leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,
      skirra! What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
      out?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay
      as a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh—

      bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call
      the watch. I’ve the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So,
      so, (<i>thrusts his head down the scuttle</i>,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight
      bells there below! Tumble up!
    </p>
<p>
      DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark
      this in our old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as filliping
      to others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like ground-tier
      butts. At ’em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail ’em through
      it. Tell ’em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell ’em it’s the
      resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That’s the
      way—<i>that’s</i> it; thy throat ain’t spoiled with eating Amsterdam
      butter.

      FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let’s have a jig or two before we ride to
      anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by
      all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!
    </p>
<p>
      PIP. (<i>Sulky and sleepy.</i>) Don’t know where it is.

      Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs!
      legs!

<p>
      ICELAND SAILOR. I don’t like your floor, maty; it’s too springy to my

      they are dancing over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—that’s the

      O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well,

      snow’s caps turn to jig it now. They’ll shake their tassels soon. Now
      would all the waves were women, then I’d go drown, and chassee with them
      evermore! There’s naught so sweet on earth—heaven may not match it!—as

      else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (<i>Nudging</i>.)

      TAHITAN SAILOR. (<i>Reclining on a mat</i>.) Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing
      girls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still
      rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the
      wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted
      quite. Ah me!—not thou nor I can bear the change! How then, if so be
      transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee’s peak
      of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?—The
      blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (<i>Leaps to his feet</i>.)

      PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing ’gainst the side! Stand by

      DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou
      holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He’s no more
      afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with
      storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!

      when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain

      they go, all cursing, and here I don’t. Fine prospects to ’em; they’re on
      the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps
      there are worse yet—they are your white squalls, they. White
      squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard all their chat just
      now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but spoken of once! and
      only this evening—it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine—that
      anaconda of an old man swore ’em in to hunt him! Oh, thou big white God
      aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy

      CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.
    </h2>
<p>
      I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my
      oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I
      hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild,
      mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud seemed
      mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster
      against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and
      revenge.
    </p>
<p>
      For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded
      White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the
      Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a
      few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who
      as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.
      For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they
      were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them
      adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom
      or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a
      single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each
      separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all
      these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the
      spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
      individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted,
      that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time,
      or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and
      malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
      completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I
      say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick.
      Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not
      unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
      attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
      battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were
      content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the
      perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.
      In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale
      had hitherto been popularly regarded.
    </p>
<p>
      And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
      caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
      them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other
      whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these
      assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs,
      or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of fatality;
      those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their
      terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude
      of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually
      come.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
      horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do
      fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
      terrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but,
      in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
      abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And
      as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
      surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
      fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only
      are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness
      hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the
      most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly
      astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest
      marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest
      waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand
      shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught
      hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes,
      pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by
      influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty
      birth.
    </p>
<p>
      No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the
      widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the
      end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
      half-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually
      invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly
      appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that
      few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of
      those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.
    </p>
<p>
      But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
      Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale,
      as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died
      out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among
      them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to
      the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps—either from professional
      inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the
      Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among
      those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never
      hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the
      leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the
      North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
      fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.
      Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere
      more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.
    </p>
<p>
      And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
      times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists—Olassen
      and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a
      consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so
      incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor
      even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost similar
      impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms
      that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are “struck
      with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the precipitancy of their
      flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause
      instantaneous death.” And however the general experiences in the fishery
      may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to
      the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in
      some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.
    </p>
<p>
      So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of
      the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the
      Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised
      Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare;
      such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully
      pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm
      Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to
      be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable
      documents that may be consulted.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were
      ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing
      only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of
      any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were
      sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.
    </p>
<p>
      One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
      with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the
      unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been
      encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
      without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets
      of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most
      erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the
      surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from
      time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory
      speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes
      whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such
      vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.
    </p>
<p>
      It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as
      well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that
      some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies
      have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is
      it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared
      that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded
      very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some
      whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never
      a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of
      living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello
      mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which
      the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more
      wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were
      believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these
      fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the
      whalemen.
    </p>
<p>
      Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing
      that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive;
      it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still
      further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous,
      but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves
      of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away
      unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a
      sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows
      hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.
    </p>
<p>
      But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
      the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the
      imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk
      that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was
      elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a
      high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the
      tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his
      identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.
    </p>
<p>
      The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the
      same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
      appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his
      vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea,
      leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
      gleamings.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
      deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
      as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific
      accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than
      all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
      else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent
      symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly,
      and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or
      drive them back in consternation to their ship.
    </p>
<p>
      Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar
      disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the
      fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s infernal
      aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused,
      was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent
      agent.
    </p>
<p>
      Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his
      more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats,
      and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds
      of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that
      smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
    </p>
<p>
      His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
      eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
      dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking
      with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That
      captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his
      sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab’s leg,
      as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired
      Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small
      reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal
      encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all
      the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to
      identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual
      and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the
      monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men
      feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and
      half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning;
      to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the
      worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue
      devil;—Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but
      deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted
      himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and torments;
      all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all
      that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of
      life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and
      made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white
      hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from
      Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot
      heart’s shell upon it.
    </p>
<p>
      It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the
      precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,
      knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal
      animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but
      felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this
      collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and
      weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in
      mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his
      torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made
      him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the
      encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from
      the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;
      and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his
      Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his
      mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in
      his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the
      gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with
      mild stun’sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all
      appearances, the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape
      Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light
      and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
      and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the
      direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved
      on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you
      think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler
      form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like
      the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but
      unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing
      monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been left behind; so in
      that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had
      perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If
      such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general
      sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own
      mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one
      end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely
      brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.
    </p>
<p>
      This is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But
      vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far
      down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we
      here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take
      your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
      where far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root of
      grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried
      beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the
      great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits,
      upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down
      there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family
      likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your
      grim sire only will the old State-secret come.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are
      sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change,
      or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble;
      in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only
      subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless,
      so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he
      stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but
      naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which
      had overtaken him.
    </p>
<p>
      The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
      ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
      always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present
      voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far
      from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of
      such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were
      inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the
      better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and
      wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without,
      with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one,
      could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his
      lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason
      thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would
      seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the
      attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret
      of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed
      upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of
      hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but
      half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast
      and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They
      were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars
      from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and
      supernatural revenge.
    </p>
<p>
      Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a
      Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up
      of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled
      also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
      Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
      Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered,
      seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
      to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded
      to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
      that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their
      insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be—what the White
      Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in
      some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon of
      the seas of life,—all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than
      Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one
      tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his
      pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a
      seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment
      of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the
      whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.

      CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.
    </h2>
<p>
      What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was
      to me, as yet remains unsaid.
    </p>
<p>
      Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
      could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there was
      another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at
      times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so
      mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting
      it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above
      all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and
      yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these
      chapters might be naught.
    </p>
<p>
      Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as
      if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and
      pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain
      royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu
      placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants” above all their other
      magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam
      unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the
      Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the
      great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the
      imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it
      applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership
      over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been
      even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone
      marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and
      symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble
      things—the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among
      the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the
      deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the
      majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the
      daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in
      the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the
      symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire
      worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar;
      and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a
      snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice
      of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology,
      that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could
      send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity;
      and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests
      derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,
      worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish
      faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of
      our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the
      redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the
      great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool;
      yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and
      honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the
      innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than
      that redness which affrights in blood.
    </p>
<p>
      This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
      divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
      terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
      Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;
      what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors
      they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent
      mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their
      aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so
      stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*
    </p>
<p>
      *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
      would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness,
      separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that
      brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only
      rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the
      creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love;
      and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds,
      the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even
      assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you
      would not have that intensified terror.
    </p>
<p>
      As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
      creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
      same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit
      by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for
      the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence <i>Requiem</i>
      denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in
      allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the
      mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him <i>Requin</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
      wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
      imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,
      unflattering laureate, Nature.*
    </p>
<p>
      *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
      gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
      below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main
      hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a
      hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast
      archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and
      throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some
      king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange
      eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham
      before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings
      so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable
      warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy
      of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through
      me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was
      this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it
      conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore!
      never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman’s name
      for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have
      had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I
      saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor
      knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly
      burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
    </p>
<p>
      I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly
      lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a
      solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I
      have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the
      Antarctic fowl.
    </p>
<p>
      But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell;
      with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last
      the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round
      its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting it escape. But
      I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven,
      when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and
      adoring cherubim!
    </p>
<p>
      Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the
      White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed,
      small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs
      in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast
      herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the
      Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward
      trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of
      light. The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail,
      invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters
      could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of
      that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and
      hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked
      majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether
      marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that
      endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his
      circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White Steed
      gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool
      milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest
      Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be
      questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that
      it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with
      divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though
      commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.
    </p>
<p>
      But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
      accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
      Albatross.
    </p>
<p>
      What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
      the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is
      that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears.
      The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive deformity—and
      yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely
      hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the
      less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning
      attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of
      the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some
      historic instances, has the art of human malice omitted so potent an
      auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in
      Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the
      desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place!
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind
      fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be
      doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most
      appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that
      pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world, as
      of mortal trepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow
      the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our
      superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our
      phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog—Yea, while these
      terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when
      personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.
    </p>
<p>
      Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing
      he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized
      significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
    </p>
<p>
      But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
      account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the
      citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness—though
      for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct
      associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless,
      is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however modified;—can we
      thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause
      we seek?
    </p>
<p>
      Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and
      without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And
      though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about to
      be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
      entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to
      recall them now.
    </p>
<p>
      Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
      acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention
      of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless
      processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen
      snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American
      States, why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun,
      evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings
      (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of
      London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled
      American, than those other storied structures, its neighbors—the
      Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White
      Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic
      ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while the
      thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant
      dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes, does the
      name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy, while that
      of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild
      afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of
      sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed
      to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does
      “the tall pale man” of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor
      unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this
      phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
    </p>
<p>
      Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
      earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness
      of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning
      spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of
      anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon
      each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it is not these things alone
      which make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can’st see. For
      Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror in this
      whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for
      ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads
      over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its
      own distortions.
    </p>
<p>
      I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is
      not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects
      otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror
      in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely
      consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form
      at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by these two
      statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following
      examples.
    </p>
<p>
      First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by
      night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just
      enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely
      similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship
      sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if from
      encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him,
      then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the
      whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead
      assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go down;
      he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is the
      mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking
      hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?”
     </p>
<p>
      Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
      snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere
      fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
      altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to
      lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the
      backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an
      unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to
      break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the
      scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of
      legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half
      shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,
      views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean
      ice monuments and splintered crosses.
    </p>
<p>
      But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a
      white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo,
      Ishmael.
    </p>
<p>
      Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
      Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the
      sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he
      cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why
      will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies
      of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild
      creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he
      smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of
      former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black
      bisons of distant Oregon?
    </p>
<p>
      No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
      knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
      Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison
      herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which
      this instant they may be trampling into dust.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of
      the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed
      snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that
      buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
    </p>
<p>
      Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
      sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
      those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world
      seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
    </p>
<p>
      But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned
      why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more
      portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning
      symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian’s Deity;
      and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in things the most
      appalling to mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and
      immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
      thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way?
      Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the
      visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all
      colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full
      of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour of
      atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of
      the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately
      or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods;
      yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
      young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in
      substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature
      absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the
      charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the
      mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great
      principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if
      operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips
      and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied
      universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland,
      who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the
      wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that
      wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino
      whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?
