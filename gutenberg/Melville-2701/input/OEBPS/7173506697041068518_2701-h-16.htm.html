      CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.
    </h2>
<p>
      The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick
      De Deer, master, of Bremen.
    </p>
<p>
      At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
      Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals
      of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in
      the Pacific.
    </p>
<p>
      For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
      While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
      boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
      bows instead of the stern.
    </p>
<p>
      “What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something
      wavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s
      coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big
      tin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s
      all right, is the Yarman.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He’s
      out of oil, and has come a-begging.”
     </p>
<p>
      However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
      whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
      proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
      really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
      indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.
    </p>
<p>
      As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding
      what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced
      his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the
      conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching
      his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness—his
      last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet
      captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was
      indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a <i>clean</i> one (that is, an
      empty one), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
    </p>
<p>
      His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
      ship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
      mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
      without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round
      his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats
      that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod’s keels.
      There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were
      going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their
      flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a
      great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment
      upon the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped
      old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the
      unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the
      jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod
      in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such
      venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their
      wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the
      white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell
      formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and
      laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself
      in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
      seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters
      behind him to upbubble.
    </p>
<p>
      “Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m
      afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds
      are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind I ever
      knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must
      be, he’s lost his tiller.”
     </p>
<p>
      As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load
      of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so
      did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning
      over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the
      unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in
      battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.
    </p>
<p>
      “Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded
      arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or the
      German will have him.”
     </p>
<p>
      With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
      fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable
      whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with
      such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At
      this juncture the Pequod’s keels had shot by the three German boats last
      lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick’s boat still led the
      chase, though every moment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing
      they feared, was, that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be
      enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass
      him. As for Derick, he seemed quite confident that this would be the case,
      and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the
      other boats.
    </p>
<p>
      “The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and dares
      me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!”—then
      in his old intense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s
      against my religion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous Yarman—Pull—won’t
      ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead
      of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why don’t some of ye burst a
      blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping an anchor overboard—we don’t
      budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo, here’s grass growing in the
      boat’s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast there’s budding. This won’t
      do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is, men, will ye
      spit fire or not?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down—“What
      a hump—Oh, <i>do</i> pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads,
      <i>do</i> spring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads—baked
      clams and muffins—oh, <i>do</i>, <i>do</i>, spring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t
      lose him now—don’t oh, <i>don’t!</i>—see that Yarman—Oh, won’t
      ye pull for your duff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’t ye
      love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a
      whole bank! The bank of England!—Oh, <i>do</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>do!</i>—What’s that
      Yarman about now?”
     </p>
<p>
      At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
      advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
      retarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically accelerating
      his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
    </p>
<p>
      “The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty
      thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,
      Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for
      the honor of old Gayhead? What d’ye say?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.
    </p>
<p>
      Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s
      three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
      momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
      headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly,
      occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, “There
      she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman!
      Sail over him!”
     </p>
<p>
      But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their
      gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a
      righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of
      his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his
      white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh to capsizing,
      and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that was a good
      time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a mortal
      start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German’s quarter. An
      instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale’s
      immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming
      swell that he made.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now
      going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented
      jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to
      this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at
      every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways
      rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with
      clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving
      to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with
      plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb
      brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice,
      save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the
      sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk,
      portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the
      stoutest man who so pitied.
    </p>
<p>
      Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s boats
      the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to
      hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the
      last chance would for ever escape.
    </p>
<p>
      But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three
      tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to
      their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
      barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three
      Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and
      white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s headlong
      rush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that both Derick and his
      baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying
      keels.
    </p>
<p>
      “Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing glance
      upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all right—I
      saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve
      distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a
      sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
      mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury
      on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him
      that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a
      hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going to Davy Jones—all
      a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the
      everlasting mail!”
     </p>
<p>
      But the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
      tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the
      loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so
      fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust
      the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated
      smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at last—owing to the
      perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the
      three ropes went straight down into the blue—the gunwales of the
      bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high
      in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they
      remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the
      position was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and
      lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as it is called; this
      hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is
      that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp
      lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be
      doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable
      to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more
      he is exhausted. Because, owing to the enormous surface of him—in a
      full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet—the
      pressure of the water is immense. We all know what an astonishing
      atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground,
      in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a
      column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight
      of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of
      twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on
      board.
    </p>
<p>
      As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into
      its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay,
      not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman
      would have thought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the
      utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight
      inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible
      that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the
      big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of
      board. Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said—“Canst
      thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? The
      sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the
      habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee;
      darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!” This
      the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the prophets.
      For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run
      his head under the mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s
      fish-spears!
    </p>
<p>
      In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent
      down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough to
      shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale
      must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
    </p>
<p>
      “Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
      vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
      magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
      oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
      from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
      upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
      scared from it into the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      “Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”
     </p>
<p>
      The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth
      could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
      dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship’s
      lengths of the hunters.
    </p>
<p>
      His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals
      there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby
      when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
      certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it
      is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that
      when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at
      once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by
      the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface,
      his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is
      the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior
      fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable
      period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the
      well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats
      pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and
      the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from
      the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
      spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its
      affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came,
      because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they
      significantly call it, was untouched.
    </p>
<p>
      As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his
      form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed.
      His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As
      strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when
      prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes had once occupied,
      now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was
      none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must
      die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other
      merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that
      preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his
      blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or
      protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.
    </p>
<p>
      “A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”
     </p>
<p>
      But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous
      jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable
      anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly
      darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over
      with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring the bows. It was
      his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood,
      that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting on
      his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over and over
      slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of his
      belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring
      spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some
      mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the
      spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground—so the last long dying
      spout of the whale.
    </p>
<p>
      Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
      showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,
      by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so
      that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a
      few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when the
      ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was strongly
      secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless
      artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.
    </p>
<p>
      It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the
      entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on
      the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of
      harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with
      the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to
      denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other
      unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration
      alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone
      being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm
      about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been
      darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before America was discovered.
    </p>
<p>
      What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet
      there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by
      the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing
      to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck,
      who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it
      so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been
      capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when
      the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable
      strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were
      fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime everything in
      the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like
      walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped.
      Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from
      their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows
      were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift
      from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the
      submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole
      tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed
      on the point of going over.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in such a
      devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for
      it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of
      ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy
      hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at
      the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given,
      when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every
      fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale
      is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted
      for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its
      side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales
      that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads
      of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might
      with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon
      specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of
      buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest
      health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the
      warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even
      these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
    </p>
<p>
      Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
      accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
      Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
      no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his
      Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
      incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances where,
      after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again
      rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases
      are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort
      of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.
      In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a
      Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty
      of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for
      it when it shall have ascended again.
    </p>
<p>
      It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
      the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering
      her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,
      belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible
      power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is so similar to the
      Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it.
      And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this
      unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young
      keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold,
      hopeful chase.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.

      CHAPTER 82. The Honor and Glory of Whaling.
    </h2>
<p>
      There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true
      method.
    </p>
<p>
      The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to
      the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great
      honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great
      demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have
      shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I
      myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.
    </p>
<p>
      The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the
      eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by
      our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the
      knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the
      distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine
      story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of
      a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the
      very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly
      advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the maid. It
      was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers
      of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first
      dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa,
      now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood
      for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and
      all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that
      Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to
      Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in
      this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
    </p>
<p>
      Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some
      supposed to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of
      St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale;
      for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled
      together, and often stand for each other. “Thou art as a lion of the
      waters, and as a dragon of the sea,” saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly
      meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word
      itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had
      St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of
      doing battle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake,
      but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to
      march boldly up to a whale.
    </p>
<p>
      Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
      creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
      represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on
      land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance of
      those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists; and
      considering that as in Perseus’ case, St. George’s whale might have
      crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
      ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
      bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible with
      the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this
      so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In fact,
      placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare
      like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name;
      who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s head and both the
      palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of
      him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is
      the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we harpooneers of
      Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St. George. And
      therefore, let not the knights of that honorable company (none of whom, I
      venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron),
      let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen
      frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George’s
      decoration than they.
    </p>
<p>
      Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained
      dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique
      Crockett and Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds,
      was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly
      makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he
      ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.
      Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate
      the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I claim him for one of our
      clan.
    </p>
<p>
      But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules
      and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient
      Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ; certainly they are
      very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the prophet?
    </p>
<p>
      Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
      roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal
      kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing
      short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to
      be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of
      the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine
      Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten
      earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.
      When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate
      the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to
      Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose
      perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning
      the creation, and which therefore must have contained something in the
      shape of practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were lying at
      the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and
      sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes.
      Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse is
      called a horseman?
    </p>
<p>
      Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a member-roll
      for you! What club but the whaleman’s can head off like that?

      CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.
    </h2>
<p>
      Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the
      preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical
      story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks
      and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times,
      equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the
      dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those
      traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
    </p>
<p>
      One old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
      story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
      embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
      Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true
      with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the
      varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying,
      “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small. But, to
      this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,
      hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale’s belly,
      but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems
      reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale’s mouth
      would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the
      players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow
      tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.
    </p>
<p>
      Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want
      of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
      reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But
      this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist
      supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a <i>dead</i>
      whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
      their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been
      divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was thrown
      overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to
      another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I
      would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some craft are nowadays
      christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor have there been
      wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the
      book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an inflated bag of wind—which
      the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor
      Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another
      reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was
      swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he
      was vomited up somewhere within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on
      the Tigris, very much more than three days’ journey across from the
      nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?
    </p>
<p>
      But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
      short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way
      of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the
      whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf
      and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete
      circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris
      waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim
      in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so
      early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland
      from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history
      a liar.
    </p>
<p>
      But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish
      pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that
      he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and
      the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable,
      devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese
      Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going to Nineveh via the Cape
      of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general
      miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks
      devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And some three
      centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s Voyages, speaks of a
      Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous
      lamp that burnt without any oil.

      CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.
    </h2>
<p>
      To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed;
      and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation
      upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as
      such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible
      advantage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a
      sliding thing, and that the object in view is to make the boat slide
      bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning
      not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than
      customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it
      hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently
      seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft’s bald keel. He seemed to
      be working in obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain
      unwarranted by the event.
    </p>
<p>
      Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
      them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight,
      as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great
      exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
      stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
      flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the
      planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
      imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to
      haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious.
      What then remained?
    </p>
<p>
      Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
      countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
      none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small
      sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is
      only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and
      feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately
      darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.
      Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in
      length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a
      lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a
      warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand
      after darting.
    </p>
<p>
      But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the
      harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom
      done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of
      the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the
      lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing,
      therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling
      comes into play.
    </p>
<p>
      Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
      equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in
      pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
      flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.
      Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length
      to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of
      the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving
      the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before his waistband’s
      middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily
      depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the
      weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He
      minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin. Next
      moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright
      steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the
      whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
    </p>
<p>
      “That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal
      Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old Orleans
      whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad,
      I’d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink round it! Yea,
      verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the spread of his
      spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff.”
     </p>
<p>
      Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the
      spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash. The
      agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and the
      pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches the
      monster die.

      CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.
    </h2>
<p>
      That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of
      ages before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the
      sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so
      many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
      thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale,
      watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should be,
      and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes
      past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it
      should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all,
      really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a noteworthy
      thing.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
      contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills,
      the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined
      with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live
      a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to
      his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human
      being’s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the
      open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the
      upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for,
      in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight
      feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no
      connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and
      this is on the top of his head.
    </p>
<p>
      If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable
      to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element,
      which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to
      the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I
      may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it
      follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath,
      he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a
      considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing.
      Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who
      systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the
      bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling
      a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between
      his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable
      involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when
      he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So
      that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a
      surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless
      desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four
      supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
      indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and
      true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
      inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in <i>having his spoutings out</i>, as
      the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising
      to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time
      exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven
      minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then
      whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over
      again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,
      so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his
      regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,
      will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however,
      that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one
      they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his
      spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere
      descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the
      whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not
      by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a
      thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O
      hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!
    </p>

      In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving
      for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
      attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
      Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
    </p>
<p>
      It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if
      it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I
      opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems
      obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to
      his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two
      elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But
      owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water or whether it
      be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this
      head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper
      olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no
      Cologne-water in the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
      canal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is
      furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward
      retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has
      no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely
      rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to
      say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to
      this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
      living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
    </p>
<p>
      Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for
      the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just
      beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this
      curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side
      of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a
      water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the
      mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed
      with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It
      is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal;
      but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water
      through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would
      seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm
      Whale’s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if
      he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
      watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme
      between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.
    </p>
<p>
      But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You
      have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell
      water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle
      these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of
      all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be
      undecided as to what it is precisely.
    </p>
<p>
      The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
      it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when,
      always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his
      spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around
      him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops
      of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely
      condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those
      identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is
      countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For even when tranquilly
      swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump
      sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then, the whale always
      carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you
      will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
      precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
      into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
      this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
      slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often
      happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing
      so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with
      the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I
      cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among
      whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another
      thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet
      is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the
      investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout
      alone.
    </p>
<p>
      Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
      hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other
      reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the
      great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no
      common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is
      never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are.
      He is both ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads
      of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil,
      Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible
      steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a
      little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before
      me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and
      undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my
      hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin
      shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for
      the above supposition.
    </p>
<p>
      And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
      behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
      head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
      contemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified
      by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For,
      d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor.
      And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine
      intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And
      for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or
      denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things
      earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes
      neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with
      equal eye.
