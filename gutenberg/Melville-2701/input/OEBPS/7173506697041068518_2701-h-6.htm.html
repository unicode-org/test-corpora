      CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.
    </h2>
<p>
      Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went
      rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually
      reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly
      cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as
      crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up—flaked up, with
      rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
      jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their
      absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, ’twas
      hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights. But all
      the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and
      potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the soul,
      especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her
      crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these
      subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.
    </p>
<p>
      Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
      man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the
      old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked
      deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to
      live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the
      cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels like going down into
      one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an old captain
      like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug
      berth.”
     </p>
<p>
      So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
      set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and
      when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it
      not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its
      place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of
      steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman
      would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge,
      gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way. Some considering
      touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually
      abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,
      seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been
      the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would
      have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him
      too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was
      measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate,
      came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness,
      hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one
      could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting
      something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
      insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab
      then.
    </p>
<p>
      “Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that
      fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where
      such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.—Down,
      dog, and kennel!”
     </p>
<p>
      Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
      scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, “I
      am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like
      it, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as
      if to avoid some passionate temptation.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be called a
      dog, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or
      I’ll clear the world of thee!”
     </p>
<p>
      As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in
      his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
    </p>
<p>
      “I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,” muttered
      Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s very queer.
      Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go back and strike
      him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for him?
      Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time
      I ever <i>did</i> pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer too; aye, take him
      fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How
      he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway
      there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a
      deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours
      out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then. Didn’t that Dough-Boy,
      the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man’s
      hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot,
      and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of
      frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I
      guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it’s a kind of
      Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don’t
      know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He’s full of
      riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as
      Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s that for, I should like to know?
      Who’s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But
      there’s no telling, it’s the old game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn
      me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be born into the world, if only to fall
      right asleep. And now that I think of it, that’s about the first thing
      babies do, and that’s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are
      queer, come to think of ’em. But that’s against my principles. Think not,
      is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So
      here goes again. But how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he
      called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of <i>that!</i>
      He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he <i>did</i> kick me,
      and I didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow.
      It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I
      don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of
      turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though—How?
      how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to hammock
      again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over
      by daylight.”

      CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.
    </h2>
<p>
      When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks;
      and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the
      watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting
      the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side
      of the deck, he sat and smoked.
    </p>
<p>
      In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
      fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one
      look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him
      of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the
      sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in
      quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How now,”
       he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no longer
      soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here
      have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and
      ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such
      nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the
      strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?
      This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors
      among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I’ll
      smoke no more—”
     </p>
<p>
      He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the
      waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made.
      With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.

      CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.
    </h2>
<p>
      Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
    </p>
<p>
      “Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s ivory
      leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back,
      upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto!
      Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But
      what was still more curious, Flask—you know how curious all dreams
      are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be
      thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that
      kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not a real leg,
      only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between a living thump
      and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty
      times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member—that
      makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the
      while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed
      pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I
      say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg now, but a cane—a
      whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a playful cudgelling—in
      fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick. Besides,’
      thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot part—what
      a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,
      <i>there’s</i> a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a
      point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I
      was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman,
      with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.
      ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a
      phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. ‘What am I about?’
      says I at last. ‘And what business is that of yours, I should like to
      know, Mr. Humpback? Do <i>you</i> want a kick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no
      sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and
      dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—what do you think, I
      saw?—why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of
      marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, ‘I guess I
      won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’ said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept
      muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney
      hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise
      Stubb,’ I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I
      had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that
      kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I, ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye
      here,’ says he; ‘let’s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t
      he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I—‘right <i>here</i> it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he
      used his ivory leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says
      he, ‘wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right
      good will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No,
      you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.
      It’s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old
      England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,
      and made garter-knights of; but, be <i>your</i> boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked
      by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; <i>be</i> kicked by
      him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can’t
      help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’ With that, he all
      of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the
      air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do
      you think of that dream, Flask?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”
     </p>
<p>
      “May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab
      standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you
      can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever
      he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!
    </p>
<p>
      “If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
    </p>
<p>
      “What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of
      something queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man?
      Look ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for it,
      Flask. Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this
      way.”

      CHAPTER 32. Cetology.
    </h2>
<p>
      Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in
      its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the
      Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the
      leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost
      indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special
      leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.
    </p>
<p>
      It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that
      I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The
      classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
      essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.
    </p>
<p>
      “No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
      Cetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.
    </p>
<p>
      “It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as
      to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * *
      Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal” (sperm whale),
      says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.
    </p>
<p>
      “Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.”
       “Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field strewn
      with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us
      naturalists.”
     </p>
<p>
      Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
      those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
      knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some
      small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men,
      small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in
      little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors of the
      Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray;
      Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;
      Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier;
      John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of
      Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate
      generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will
      show.
    </p>
<p>
      Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever
      saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer
      and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the
      Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby
      knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with
      which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it
      said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.
      He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the
      long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some
      seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown
      sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all
      but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been
      every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in
      the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,
      without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has
      at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good
      people all,—the Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm
      whale now reigneth!
    </p>
<p>
      There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living
      sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree
      succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s; both in
      their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and
      reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in
      their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of
      excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As
      yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in
      any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten
      life.
    </p>
<p>
      Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive
      classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to
      be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man
      advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor
      endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to
      be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not
      pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or—in
      this place at least—to much of any description. My object here is
      simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the
      architect, not the builder.
    </p>
<p>
      But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office
      is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to
      have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis
      of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to
      hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well
      appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the
      hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through
      oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in
      earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.
    </p>
<p>
      First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is
      in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still
      remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature,
      A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from the
      fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks
      and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict, were
      still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.
    </p>
<p>
      The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from
      the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular
      heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
      intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure
      meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
      Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they
      united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
      insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.
    </p>
<p>
      Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
      ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This
      fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect
      does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given you those
      items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all
      other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
    </p>
<p>
      Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
      conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
      whale is <i>a spouting fish with a horizontal tail</i>. There you have him.
      However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.
      A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because
      he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more
      cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that
      all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or
      up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be
      similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.
    </p>
<p>
      By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from
      the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the
      whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with
      it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the
      smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this
      ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire
      whale host.
    </p>
<p>
      *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
      Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included
      by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,
      contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on
      wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as
      whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom
      of Cetology.
    </p>
<p>
      First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS
      (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all, both
      small and large.
    </p>
<p>
      I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.
    </p>
<p>
      As the type of the FOLIO I present the <i>Sperm Whale</i>; of the OCTAVO, the
      <i>Grampus</i>; of the DUODECIMO, the <i>Porpoise</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The
      <i>Sperm Whale</i>; II. the <i>Right Whale</i>; III. the <i>Fin-Back Whale</i>; IV. the
      <i>Hump-backed Whale</i>; V. the <i>Razor Back Whale</i>; VI. the <i>Sulphur Bottom Whale</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER I. (<i>Sperm Whale</i>).—This whale, among the
      English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale,
      and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the
      Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is,
      without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of
      all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far
      the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that
      valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will,
      in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I
      now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries
      ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper
      individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the
      stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly
      supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known
      in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that
      this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale
      which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times,
      also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but
      only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the
      druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in
      the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its
      original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its
      value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the
      appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from
      which this spermaceti was really derived.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER II. (<i>Right Whale</i>).—In one respect this is
      the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted
      by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and
      the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article in commerce.
      Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the
      following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the
      Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity
      concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. What
      then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It
      is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of
      the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the
      Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two
      centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic
      seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in
      the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various
      other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.
    </p>
<p>
      Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
      English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in
      all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
      determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by
      endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
      some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The
      right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to
      elucidating the sperm whale.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER III. (<i>Fin-Back</i>).—Under this head I reckon a
      monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
      Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
      whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
      Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in
      his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
      portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips
      present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds
      of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which
      he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three
      or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of
      an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the
      slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will,
      at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is
      moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this
      gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it
      may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat
      resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that
      Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He
      seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going
      solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most
      sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall
      misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power
      and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this
      leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing
      for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his
      mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a
      theoretic species denominated <i>Whalebone whales</i>, that is, whales with
      baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be
      several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed
      whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
      whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.
    </p>
<p>
      In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of great
      importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient
      in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to
      attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his
      baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts
      or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a
      regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions,
      which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump,
      back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are
      indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard
      to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential
      particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a
      hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale
      and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the
      similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above
      mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular
      combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an
      irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed
      upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has
      split.
    </p>
<p>
      But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale,
      in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right
      classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland
      whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by
      his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And
      if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you
      will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the
      systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then remains?
      nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal
      volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical
      system here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for
      it alone is practicable. To proceed.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>) CHAPTER IV. (<i>Hump Back</i>).—This whale is often seen on
      the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and
      towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might
      call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for
      him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has
      a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen.
      He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more
      gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER V. (<i>Razor Back</i>).—Of this whale little is
      known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a
      retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no
      coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises
      in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does
      anybody else.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER VI. (<i>Sulphur Bottom</i>).—Another retiring
      gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
      Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at
      least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then
      always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is never
      chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of
      him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor
      can the oldest Nantucketer.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus ends BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), and now begins BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>).
    </p>
<p>
      OCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among
      which present may be numbered:—I., the <i>Grampus</i>; II., the <i>Black Fish</i>;
      III., the <i>Narwhale</i>; IV., the <i>Thrasher</i>; V., the <i>Killer</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
      Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the
      former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in
      figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does
      not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER I. (<i>Grampus</i>).—Though this fish, whose
      loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to
      landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly
      classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive features of
      the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one. He is of
      moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length,
      and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in herds; he is
      never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and
      pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded as
      premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER II. (<i>Black Fish</i>).—I give the popular
      fishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
      Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and
      suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because
      blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena
      Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the
      circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
      carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale
      averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost
      all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in
      swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
      profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena
      whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment—as
      some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
      themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their
      blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of
      thirty gallons of oil.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER III. (<i>Narwhale</i>), that is, <i>Nostril whale</i>.—Another
      instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar
      horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some
      sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some
      exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn
      is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little
      depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side,
      which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the
      aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn
      or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used
      like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell
      me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of
      the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for
      the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it
      sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you
      cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is,
      that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale—however
      that may be—it would certainly be very convenient to him for a
      folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked
      whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious
      example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated
      nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same
      sea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote
      against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It
      was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way
      that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
      Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black
      Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,
      when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window
      of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; “when Sir
      Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black Letter, “on bended knees he
      presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which
      for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.” An Irish author
      avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to
      her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn
      nature.
    </p>
<p>
      The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
      milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His
      oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is
      seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER IV. (<i>Killer</i>).—Of this whale little is
      precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed
      naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that
      he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of
      Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and
      hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The
      Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception
      might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its
      indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and
      Sharks included.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER V. (<i>Thrasher</i>).—This gentleman is famous
      for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts
      the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging
      him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process.
      Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws,
      even in the lawless seas.
    </p>
<p>
       Thus ends BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), and begins BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>).
    </p>
<p>
      DUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza
      Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.
    </p>
<p>
      To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
      possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
      feet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular
      sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down
      above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition
      of what a whale is—<i>i.e.</i> a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>), CHAPTER 1. (<i>Huzza Porpoise</i>).—This is the
      common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
      bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
      must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims
      in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to
      heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally
      hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably
      come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the lads that always
      live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can
      withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help
      ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza
      Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and
      delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in
      request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones.
      Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you
      that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
      readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and
      you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>), CHAPTER II. (<i>Algerine Porpoise</i>).—A pirate.
      Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat
      larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke
      him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but
      never yet saw him captured.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>), CHAPTER III. (<i>Mealy-mouthed Porpoise</i>).—The
      largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is
      known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is
      that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that
      he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in
      some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly
      girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no
      fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and
      sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all.
      Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a
      boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship’s hull, called the “bright
      waist,” that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate
      colours, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his
      head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just
      escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy
      aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.
    </p>
<p>
     * * * * * *
    </p>
<p>
      Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
      Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans
      of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous
      whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not
      personally. I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for
      possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may
      complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall
      hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into
      this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The
      Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape
      Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered
      Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue
      Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there
      might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner
      of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly
      help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying
      nothing.
    </p>
<p>
      Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here,
      and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my
      word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even
      as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing
      upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished
      by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone
      to posterity. God keep me from ever completing anything. This whole book
      is but a draught—nay, but the draught of a draught. Oh, Time,
      Strength, Cash, and Patience!
