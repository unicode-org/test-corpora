       BAB 53. The Gam.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Alasan kok Ahab ora munggah ing kapal sing wis diomongake yaiku: angin lan segara dadi prahara. Nanging sanajan iki ora kedadeyan, mesthine dheweke ora bakal numpak dheweke - miturut tumindake ing wektu sing padha - yen pancene, kanthi proses hailing, dheweke entuk jawaban negatif marang pitakone. Amarga, pungkasane, dheweke ora peduli karo permaisuri, sanajan limang menit, karo kapten wong liyo, kajaba dheweke bisa nyumbang sawetara informasi sing dikarepake. Nanging kabeh iki bisa uga tetep ora nyukupi kira-kira, ora ana sing diomongake ing kene babagan panggunaan kapal paus nalika ketemu ing segara manca, lan utamane ing papan pelayaran umum.
    </p>
    <p>
       Yen loro manca nyebrang Pine Barrens ing New York State, utawa merata sepi Salisbury Plain ing Inggris; yen sembrono ketemu siji lan sijine ing alam bébas sing ora ramah, wong loro iki, kanggo urip, ora bisa nyingkiri salam bebarengan; lan mandheg sedhela kanggo ngganti kabar; lan, mbok menawa, lungguh mudhun kanggo nalika lan ngaso ing konser: banjur, carane luwih alam sing marang illimitable Pine Barrens lan Salisbury Plains segara, loro prau whaling descrying saben liyane ing ends bumi-off Lone Fanning kang Island. , utawa King Mills adoh; pinten liyane alam, Aku ngomong, sing ing kahanan kaya mengkono kapal iki ngirim ora mung interchange hails, nanging teka menyang isih nyedhaki, kontak liyane loropaken lan sociable. Lan utamané iki bakal katon prakara mesthi, ing cilik saka prau diduweni ing siji plabuhan, lan kang kapten, perwira, lan ora sawetara saka wong-wong mau padha dikenal pribadi; lan Akibate, duwe kabeh limo bab domestik dear kanggo pirembagan bab.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kanggo kapal dawa absen, ing njaba-bounder, mbok menawa, wis aksara ing Papan; ing sembarang tingkat, dheweke bakal manawa kanggo supaya dheweke duwe sawetara makalah saka tanggal setahun utawa loro mengko saka pungkasan ing file burem lan jempol-worn dheweke. Lan minangka imbalan kanggo sopan santun kasebut, kapal sing metu saka njaba bakal nampa intelijen perburuan paus paling anyar saka papan pelayaran sing bisa dituju, sing paling penting kanggo dheweke. Lan ing jurusan, kabeh iki bakal bener bab kapal paus nyabrang trek saben liyane ing layaran-lemah dhewe, sanadyan padha merata absen saka ngarep. Kanggo salah siji saka wong-wong mau uga wis nampa transfer layang saka sawetara katelu, lan saiki adoh adoh prau; lan sawetara layang sing bisa kanggo wong ing kapal dheweke saiki ketemu. Kajaba iku, dheweke bakal ijol-ijolan kabar babagan perburuan paus, lan ngobrol. Amarga ora mung bakal ketemu karo kabeh simpati para pelaut, nanging uga karo kabeh congenialities aneh sing muncul saka nguber umum lan privations lan bebaya bebarengan.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ora bakal beda negara nggawe prabédan sing penting banget; yaiku, anggere loro pihak nganggo basa siji, kaya ing Amerika lan Inggris. Sanadyan, kanggo mesthekake, saka jumlah cilik saka whalers Inggris, rapat-rapat kuwi ora banget asring kelakon, lan nalika padha kedaden ana banget apt kanggo dadi Urut saka isin antarane wong-wong mau; amarga wong Inggris sampeyan rada undhang-undhang, lan Yankee sampeyan, dheweke ora seneng karo wong liya, kajaba awake dhewe. Kajaba iku, para pemburu paus Inggris kadhangkala mengaruhi jinis kaunggulan metropolitan tinimbang para pemburu paus Amerika; babagan Nantucketer sing dawa lan ramping, kanthi provincialisme sing ora jelas, minangka jinis petani laut. Nanging ing ngendi kaunggulan ing whalemen Inggris iki pancene dumadi, iku bakal hard kanggo ngomong, weruh sing Yankees ing siji dina, bebarengan, matèni paus luwih akeh tinimbang kabeh Inggris, bebarengan, ing sepuluh taun. Nanging iki foible sethitik mbebayani ing Inggris paus-pamburu, kang Nantucketer ora njupuk akeh kanggo jantung; mbokmenawa, amarga kang mangerténi sing wis sawetara foibles piyambak.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dadi, kita ndeleng manawa saka kabeh kapal sing mlaku ing segara kanthi kapisah, para pemburu paus duwe alasan paling akeh supaya bisa srawung - lan pancen ngono. Dene, sawetara prau sudagar nyabrang saben liyane tangi ing tengah-Atlantik, bakal kerep liwat tanpa dadi luwih minangka tembung siji pangenalan, bebarengan Cut siji liyane ing segara dhuwur, kaya brace saka dandies ing Broadway; lan kabeh wektu indulging, mbok menawa, ing kritik finical marang saben liyane rig. Dene para Prajurit Perang, nalika padha ketemu ing segara, luwih dhisik padha nglangkungi tumungkul lan kerokan sing konyol, umbul-umbul panji-panji, nganti kaya-kaya ora ana karsaning ati. lan sedulur tresna bab iku ing kabeh. Minangka ndemek patemon Budak-kapal, kok, padha cepet-cepet prodigious, padha mlayu saka saben liyane sanalika bisa. Lan kanggo Pirates, nalika padha kesempatan kanggo nyabrang balung salib saben liyane, udan es pisanan - &quot;Pira tengkorak?&quot; - cara sing padha karo para pemburu paus - &quot;Pinten barel?&quot; Lan pitakonan kasebut nate dijawab, bajak laut langsung nyingkiri, amarga dheweke minangka penjahat infernal ing loro-lorone, lan ora seneng ndeleng macem-macem villanous saben liyane.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nanging delengen wong sing mursid, jujur, ora sopan, ramah, ramah, bebas lan gampang! Apa sing ditindakake paus nalika ketemu paus liyane ing cuaca sing apik? Dheweke wis &quot;

       &quot;, bab supaya babar blas dingerteni kanggo kabeh kapal liyane sing padha tau krungu saka jeneng malah; lan yen kasempatan padha krungu bab iku, padha mung nyengir ing, lan mbaleni kuwi gamesome bab &quot;spouters&quot; lan &quot;blubber-boiler,&quot;Lan kaya exclamations cantik. Yagene kabeh Merchant-seamen, lan uga kabeh Pirates lan Man-of-War kang, lan abdi-kapal nelayan, ngurmati koyo scornful kuwi marang Whale-kapal; iki pitakonan sing bakal angel dijawab. Amarga, ing kasus bajak laut, ujar, aku pengin ngerti apa profesine duwe kamulyan sing aneh. Iku kadhangkala ends ing elevasi mboten umum, tenan; nanging mung ing gantungan. Kajaba iku, nalika wong munggah pangkat kanthi cara aneh kasebut, dheweke ora duwe dhasar sing cocog kanggo dhuwure. Pramila, kula nyimpulaken, bilih anggenipun ngegungaken dhirinipun kaluhuraken ing sadhuwure wong paus, ing pratelan kasebut, bajak laut ora duwe dhasar sing kuat kanggo ngadeg.

       Ana item cilik liyane babagan Gamming sing ora kudu dilalekake ing kene. Kabeh profesi duwe peculiarities sethitik dhewe rincian; semono uga iwak paus. Ing kapal bajak laut, wong perang, utawa budak, nalika kapten didayung ing endi wae ing prau, dheweke tansah lungguh ing seprai buritan ing kursi sing nyaman, kadhangkala empuk ana ing kono, lan asring nyopir dhewe nganggo tiller cilik sing cilik. dihiasi nganggo tali lan pita gay. Nanging prau paus ora duwe kursi sisih mburi, ora ana sofa sing kaya ngono, lan ora ana tukang kebon. Kaping dhuwur tenan, yen kapten paus padha wheeled babagan banyu ing castors kaya gouty aldermen lawas ing kursi paten. Lan kanggo tukang tani, prau paus ora tau ngakoni babagan effeminacy kasebut; lan mulane kaya ing gamming kru prau lengkap kudu ninggalake kapal, lan Empu minangka steerer prau utawa harpooneer saka nomer, sing bawahan iku steersman ing wusana, lan kapten, gadhah ora panggonan kanggo njagong ing, ditarik mati. marang rawuhe kabeh ngadeg kaya wit cemara. Lan asring sampeyan bakal sok dong mirsani sing eling saka mripat kabeh katon donya ngaso ing saka sisih loro kapal, kapten ngadeg iki kabeh urip kanggo pentinge nyonggo martabate kanthi njaga sikil. Uga iki prakara gampang banget; amarga ing mburine ana dayung kemudi sing gedhe banget sing nempuh dheweke saiki lan banjur ing mburine cilik, dayung sawise bali kanthi ngetuk dhengkul ing ngarep. Dheweke wis rampung wedged sadurunge lan konco, lan mung bisa nggedhekake piyambak miring dening dumunung mudhun ing sikil digawe dowo; nanging dadakan, pitch kasar saka prau bakal kerep pindhah adoh kanggo topple wong, amarga dawa pondasi punika boten tanpa ombone cocog. Mung nggawe sudhut nyebar saka rong cagak, lan sampeyan ora bisa ngadeg munggah. Banjur, maneh, iku ora bakal nindakake ing ngarsane kosong saka mata riveted donya, iku ora bakal nindakake, Aku ngomong, kanggo kapten straddling iki katon anteng piyambak partikel slightest dening nyekel apa karo tangan; tenan, minangka tandha saka kabeh, buoyant poto-printah, kang umume kaleksanane tangan ing kanthong trowsers kang; nanging mbok menawa kang umume gedhe banget, tangan abot, kang kaleksanane ana kanggo ballast. Nanging, ana kedadeyan, sing uga wis dikonfirmasi, ing endi kapten wis dikenal kanggo wektu kritis utawa loro sing ora umum, kanthi tiba-tiba ujar-kanggo nyekel rambut pendayung sing paling cedhak, lan terus ing kono kaya pati surem.

       Cape of Good Hope, lan kabeh wilayah banyu watara ana, akeh kaya sawetara nyatet papat sudhut dalan gedhe, ngendi sampeyan ketemu lelungan luwih saka ing bagean liyane.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ora let suwe sawise ngomong karo Goney, ana paus liyane sing mulih, yaiku Town-Ho, * ditemoni. Dheweke diawasi meh kabeh wong Polinesia. Ing gam cendhak sing ditindakake dheweke menehi kabar babagan Moby Dick. Kanggo sawetara kapentingan umum ing Paus Putih saiki saya tambah akeh amarga kahanan crita Town-Ho, sing katon ora jelas kanggo melu paus kasebut minangka kunjungan sing nggumunake lan kuwalik saka salah sawijining sing diarani pengadilan Gusti Allah sing kadhangkala ana. ngandika nyusul sawetara wong. Kahanan sing terakhir iki, kanthi iringan tartamtu, mbentuk apa sing bisa disebut minangka bagian rahasia saka tragedi sing bakal dicritakake, ora tau tekan kupinge Kapten Ahab utawa kanca-kancane. Kanggo bagean rahasia saka crita iki ora dingerteni kapten Town-Ho dhewe. Iki minangka properti pribadi saka telung pelaut putih konfederasi kapal kasebut, sing siji, misale jek, ngandhani marang Tashtego kanthi prentah Romish babagan rahasia, nanging ing wayah wengi Tashtego rambled nalika turu, lan ngungkapake babagan iki kanthi cara kasebut. , yen nalika tangi dheweke ora bisa nahan liyane. Nanging, pengaruh sing kuat banget marang para pelaut ing Pequod sing ngerti babagan iki, lan kanthi rasa sing aneh, diarani kaya ngono, mula dheweke diatur ing perkara iki, mula dheweke tetep rahasia ing antarane. dhewe supaya ora nate kedadeyan ing tiang utama Pequod. Interweaving ing panggonan sing tepat thread rodo peteng iki karo crita minangka publicly narrated ing kapal, kabèh urusan aneh iki aku saiki nerusake kanggo sijine ing rekaman langgeng.

       Kanggo humor, aku bakal ngreksa gaya sing dakcritakake ing Lima, menyang bunderan kanca-kancaku Spanyol, ing wayah wengi wong suci, ngrokok ing piazza jubin Golden Inn. Saka sing cavaliers nggoleki, Dons enom, Pedro lan Sebastian, padha ing istilah sing luwih cedhak karo kula; lan mula pitakonan interluding padha sok-sok sijine, lan kang kudune mangsuli ing wektu.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Kira-kira rong taun sadurunge pisanan aku sinau acara sing bakal daklatih kanggo sampeyan, tuan-tuan, Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler saka Nantucket, lelungan ing Pasifik sampeyan kene, ora sawetara dina belayar menyang wétan saka atap iki. apik Golden Inn. Dheweke nang endi wae ing sisih lor Line. Sawijining esuk nalika nangani pompa, miturut panggunaan saben dina, diamati dheweke nggawe banyu luwih akeh tinimbang sing umum. Padha mestine pedhang-iwak wis stabbed dheweke, Tuan-tuan. Nanging kapten, duwe sawetara alesan mboten umum kanggo pracaya sing langka apik luck ngenteni wong ing latitudes; lan mulane banget ora gelem ninggalake wong-wong mau, lan bocor kasebut ora dianggep mbebayani, sanajan, dheweke ora bisa nemokake sawise nggoleki cekungan sing paling sithik ing cuaca sing rada abot, kapal kasebut isih terus jelajah. , para pelaut sing kerja ing pompa kanthi interval sing amba lan gampang; nanging ora apik luck teka; dina liyane liwati, lan ora mung bocor durung ditemokaké, nanging sensibly tambah. Dadi luwih, sing saiki njupuk sawetara weker, kapten, nggawe kabeh pralayar, ngadeg adoh kanggo pelabuhan paling cedhak antarane pulo, ana kanggo njaluk lambunge hove metu lan didandani.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Sanajan ora ana dalan cilik sadurunge dheweke, nanging, yen kesempatan sing paling umum disenengi, dheweke ora wedi yen kapal kasebut bakal didegake, amarga pompane paling apik, lan kanthi periodik lega, dheweke nem- lan telung puluh wong bisa gampang njaga kapal gratis; ora ketompo yen bocor kudu tikel kaping pindho ing dheweke. Sejatine, cedhak kabeh bagean iki sing dirawuhi dening angin sing makmur banget, Town-Ho mesthi wis teka kanthi aman ing plabuhane tanpa kedadeyan pati sing paling sithik, yen ora amarga tumindak kasar Radney. , mate, Vineyarder, lan dendam pait provoked Steelkilt, Lakeman lan desperado saka Buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;&#39;Lakeman!—Kebo! Ndedonga, apa Lakeman, lan ngendi Buffalo?&#39; ngandika Don Sebastian, Rising ing tikar swinging saka suket.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Ing pesisir wétan Lake Erie kita, Don; nanging-Aku crave duweni Panjenengan-bisa uga, sampeyan bakal enggal krungu liyane iku. Saiki, tuan-tuan, ing brigs kothak-sail lan kapal telung masted, uga-cedhak minangka gedhe lan gagah minangka sembarang sing tau lelayaran metu saka Callao lawas kanggo adoh Manilla; Lakeman iki, ing jantung tanah-dikunci ing Amerika kita, wis durung nurtured dening kabeh sing tayangan freebooting agrarian populer disambungake karo segara mbukak. Amarga ing ongko interflowing sing, sing grand segara banyu segara kita,-Erie, lan Ontario, lan Huron, lan Superior, lan Michigan,-nduwèni expansiveness segara-kaya, karo akeh sipat noblest segara; karo akeh jinis rimmed saka balapan lan climes. Padha ngemot kapuloan bunder saka pulo romantis, malah minangka Waters Polinesia; ing bagean gedhe, sing shored dening loro negara kontras gedhe, minangka Atlantik punika; padha nyedhiyakake pendekatan maritim sing dawa menyang koloni teritorial kita saka Timur, sing ana ing saindhenging bank-bank; kene lan ana frowned marang dening baterei, lan dening bedhil craggy wedhus-kaya Mackinaw lofty; padha krungu guntur armada kamenangan laut; ing interval, padha ngasilaken pesisir kanggo barbarians alam bébas, kang pasuryan dicet abang sumunar saka metu wigwams peltry sing; kanggo liga lan liga diapit dening alas kuna lan unentered, ngendi pines gaunt ngadeg kaya garis serried raja ing Gothic genealogies; sing alas padha harboring kéwan Afrika alam bébas mangsa, lan jalmo silken kang wulu diekspor menehi jubah kanggo Kaisar Tartar; padha mirror ibukutha paving saka Buffalo lan Cleveland, uga desa Winnebago; padha ngambang kaya kapal dagang sing lengkap, kapal penjelajah bersenjata Negara, kapal kukus, lan kano beech; padha kesapu dening Borean lan dismasting jeblugan minangka nggegirisi minangka lash gelombang salted; padha ngerti apa kapal karam, amarga ora katon ing dharatan, nanging ing dharatan, dheweke wis klelep akeh kapal tengah wengi karo kabeh punggawane njerit. Mangkono, purun, sanadyan inlander, Steelkilt ana alam bébas-samudra lair, lan alam bébas-samudra nurtured; minangka akeh saka marine audacious minangka sembarang. Lan kanggo Radney, sanadyan ing bayi kang bisa uga wis glethakaken mudhun ing pantai Nantucket lone, kanggo nyusoni ing segara ibu; sanadyan ing sawise urip kang wis dawa tindakake kita austere Atlantik lan Pasifik contemplative Panjenengan; nanging dheweke cukup dendam lan kebak padu sosial kaya pelaut alas, seger saka garis lintang bowie sing ditangani. Nanging iki Nantucketer wong karo sawetara sipat apik-ati; lan Lakeman iki, marine, sing sanadyan Urut saka setan tenan, bisa durung dening firmness inflexible, mung tempered dening sing decency umum pangenalan manungsa kang hak abdi meanest; mangkono dianggep, Steelkilt iki wis dawa disimpen aman lan docile. Ing kabeh acara, dheweke wis mbuktekake nganti saiki; nanging Radney wis pinasthi lan digawe mad, lan Steelkilt-nanging, purun, sampeyan bakal krungu.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Ora luwih saka sedina utawa rong dina paling adoh sawise ngarahake prow menyang papan perlindungan pulo kasebut, bocor Town-Ho katon maneh mundhak, nanging mung mbutuhake jam utawa luwih ing pompa saben dina. Sampeyan kudu ngerti yen ing segara sing mapan lan beradab kaya Atlantik kita, umpamane, sawetara kapten ora mikir babagan ngompa kabeh; sanadyan ing wayah wengi sing isih ngantuk, yen petugas dek kelakon lali tugase ing bab kasebut, kemungkinan dheweke lan kanca-kancane ora bakal ngelingi maneh, amarga kabeh tangan alon-alon mudhun menyang ngisor. Utawa ing segara dhewekan lan galak adoh saka sampeyan menyang kulon, Tuan-tuan, iku kabeh mboten umum kanggo kapal kanggo terus clanging ing pump-ngalahake ing paduan suara lengkap malah kanggo voyage dawa owahan; sing, yen dumunung ing sadawane pesisir tolerably diakses, utawa yen sembarang mundur cukup liyane diwenehake wong. Mung nalika prau bocor ana ing bagean sing adoh banget saka banyu kasebut, sawetara garis lintang sing ora ana daratan, kapten dheweke wiwit rumangsa kuwatir.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Akeh cara iki wis karo Town-Ho; dadi nalika dheweke bocor ketemu gained sepisan maneh, ana ing bebener sawetara badhan cilik manifested dening sawetara saka dheweke perusahaan; utamané dening Radney mate. Dheweke dhawuh supaya layar ndhuwur dipasang kanthi apik, dilapisi omah maneh, lan kabeh cara ditambahi menyang angin. Saiki, Radney iki, kaya wong pengecut, lan ora seneng karo rasa kuwatir sing nggegirisi sing ndemek awake dhewe kaya makhluk sing ora wedi lan ora mikir ing darat utawa ing segara sing bisa sampeyan bayangake, tuan-tuan. Mulane, nalika piyambakipun ngulungaké solicitude iki bab safety saka kapal, sawetara seamen ngumumaké sing iku mung amarga kang dadi pemilik bagean ing dheweke. Dadi nalika padha makarya ing wayah sore ing Pumps, ana ing sirah iki ora gamesomeness cilik slily arep ing antarane wong-wong mau, lagi ngadeg karo kaki ajeg overflowed dening rippling banyu bening; cetha minangka sembarang spring gunung, purun-sing bubbling saka Pumps mlayu tengen kelompok, lan diwutahake dhewe ing spouts anteng ing lee scupper-bolongan.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Saiki, kaya sing sampeyan ngerti, ora jarang kedadeyan ing jagad konvensional kita iki - banyu utawa liya; bilih nalika wong diselehake ing printah liwat fellow-wong ketemu siji saka wong-wong mau dadi banget pinunjul ing bangga umum saka manhood, langsung marang wong iku conceives sing unconquerable dislike lan bitterness; lan yen duwe kesempatan kang bakal narik mudhun lan pulverize menara subaltern kang, lan nggawe numpuk sethitik saka bledug. Dadi iki conceit saka mine minangka bisa, purun, ing kabeh acara Steelkilt ana kewan dhuwur lan mulia karo sirah kaya Romawi, lan jenggot Golden mili kaya housings tasseled pangisi daya snorting viceroy pungkasan; lan otak, lan jantung, lan nyawa ing wong, purun, kang digawe Steelkilt Charlemagne, wis lair putra kanggo rama Charlemagne kang. Nanging Radney, ing mate, ana elek minangka bagal; nanging minangka hardy, minangka wangkal, minangka angkoro. Dheweke ora tresna Steelkilt, lan Steelkilt ngerti.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Espying mate nyedhaki nalika lagi toiling ing pump karo liyane, Lakeman kena pengaruh ora sok dong mirsani wong, nanging unawed, nerusake karo banterings gay kang.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;&#39;Aye, aye, cah lanang-lanangku, iki bocor sing rame iki; terus cannikin, siji saka sampeyan, lan ayo padha duwe rasa. Dening Gusti, iku worth botol! Aku pitutur marang kowe, wong, investasi Rad lawas kudu ditindakake! dheweke wis paling apik Cut adoh bagean awak lan nggeret menyang ngarep. Kasunyatane, bocah-bocah, iwak pedhang mung miwiti pakaryan; dheweke wis bali maneh karo geng kapal-tukang kayu, saw-fish, lan file-fish, lan apa ora; lan kabeh posse saka &#39;em saiki hard ing karya Cut lan slashing ing ngisor; nggawe dandan, Aku Upaminipun. Yen Rad lawas saiki ana ing kene, aku bakal ngandhani dheweke mlumpat menyang segara lan nyebarake. Dheweke main setan karo estate, aku bisa ngomong. Nanging dheweke iku jiwa lawas sing prasaja, -Rad, lan uga ayu. Wong lanang, padha ngomong liyane saka properti nandur modhal ing looking-kaca tingal. Aku kepengin weruh yen dheweke bakal menehi setan miskin kaya aku model irunge.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;&#39;Mripate sampeyan! apa sing mandheg pompa?&#39; nggero Radney, ethok-ethok ora krungu omongane para pelaut. &#39;Gumuruh adoh ing!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;&#39;Inggih, inggih, Pak,&#39; ujare Steelkilt, seneng banget kaya jangkrik. &#39;Seneng, lanang, sregep, saiki!&#39; Lan karo sing pump clanged kaya sèket geni-mesin; wong-wong mau mbuwang topi kasebut, lan ora suwe yen paru-paru sing aneh kasebut keprungu sing nuduhake ketegangan energi paling gedhe ing urip.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Pungkasane metu saka pompa, karo liyane saka band, Lakeman maju kabeh panting, lan lungguh dhewe mudhun ing windlass; pasuryane abang murub, mripate getihe, lan ngusap kringet sing akeh banget saka dahi. Saiki apa fiend cozening iku, purun, sing duwe Radney kanggo meddle karo wong kuwi ing negara corporeally exasperated, Aku ora ngerti; nanging kedaden. Intolerably striding bebarengan geladhak, mate dhawuh marang kanggo njaluk sapu lan Sapuan mudhun planks, lan uga shovel, lan mbusak sawetara prakara nyerang consequent marang ngijini babi kanggo mbukak ing gedhe.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Saiki, Bapak-bapak, nyapu dek kapal ing segara iku minangka pagawean omah sing ing salawas-lawase nanging raging gale ajeg dirawuhi saben sore; wis dikenal wis rampung ing cilik saka kapal bener founding ing wektu. Kuwi, purun, punika inflexibility saka segara-usages lan katresnan naluri neatness ing seamen; sawetara sing ora gelem klelep tanpa wisuh pasuryan. Nanging ing kabeh prau bisnis sapu iki minangka provinsi preskriptif lanang, yen lanang ana ing kapal. Kajaba iku, wong-wong sing luwih kuwat ing Town-Ho sing wis dipérang dadi geng, kanthi giliran ing pompa; lan dadi seaman paling atletik saka wong-wong mau kabeh, Steelkilt wis ajeg diutus kapten siji saka geng; mula dheweke kudu dibebasake saka urusan sepele sing ora ana hubungane karo tugas bahari, kaya ngono karo kanca-kancane. Aku nyebutake kabeh katrangan kasebut supaya sampeyan bisa ngerti persis kepiye kedadeyan kasebut ing antarane wong loro kasebut.

       &quot;Nanging ana luwih saka iki: pesenan babagan shovel meh padha tegese kanggo nyengat lan ngina Steelkilt, kaya Radney wis ngidoni pasuryane. Sapa wae wong sing wis dadi pelaut ing kapal paus bakal ngerti iki; lan kabeh iki lan mesthi luwih akeh, Lakeman kanthi mangertos nalika mate ngucapake dhawuhe. Nanging nalika lungguh isih kanggo wayahe, lan kang steadfastly kapandeng menyang mata ganas mate lan wikan tumpukan saka wêdakakêna-casks heaped munggah ing wong lan alon-cocog meneng kobong bebarengan menyang wong-wong mau; amarga dheweke kanthi instinctively weruh kabeh iki, sing sabar aneh lan unwillingness kanggo nglakoake passionateness luwih jero ing sembarang wis ireful makhluk-a repugnancy paling felt, nalika felt ing kabeh, dening wong tenan gagah prakosa sanajan aggrieved — iki aran phantom aran, gentlemen, nyolong. liwat Steelkilt.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Mulane, kanthi nada biasa, mung rada rusak amarga kesel awak sing sementara, dheweke mangsuli yen nyapu dek dudu urusane, lan dheweke ora bakal nindakake. Banjur, tanpa nyebutake shovel, dheweke nuding bocah telu minangka tukang nyapu adat; sing, ora billeted ing Pumps, wis rampung sethitik utawa boten kabeh dina. Iki, Radney mangsuli karo sumpah, ing cara paling domineering lan ngagetake unconditionally reiterating printah; Sauntara kuwi, maju menyang Lakeman sing isih lungguh, kanthi palu klub cooper sing diangkat, sing direbut saka tong sampah sing cedhak.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Dipanasake lan nepsu amarga dheweke kerja keras ing pompa, amarga kabeh rasa sabar sing ora bisa dingerteni, Steelkilt sing kringet bisa nandhang lara ing pasangan; nanging kepriye wae isih ngempet kobongan ing njerone, tanpa ngomong dheweke tetep bosok ing kursine, nganti pungkasane Radney sing nesu ngocok palu ing sawetara inci saka pasuryane, kanthi ngamuk mrentah dheweke supaya nindakake perintahe.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Steelkilt wungu, lan alon-alon mundur ngubengi windlass, terus-terusan diterusake dening pasangan karo palu sing mbebayani, kanthi sengaja mbaleni niat ora manut. Nanging weruh, yen sabar ora ana pengaruh sing sethithik, kanthi tetembungan sing nggegirisi lan ora bisa diucapake nganggo tangane sing bengkong, dheweke ngelingake wong sing bodho lan kepincut; nanging ora ana gunane. Lan kanthi cara iki wong loro mau alon-alon ngubengi kendharaan; nalika, mantun ing pungkasan maneh kanggo mundur, bethinking wong sing saiki wis forborne minangka akeh minangka comported karo banyolan kang, Lakeman ngaso ing hatches lan kanthi mangkono ngandika marang perwira:
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;&#39;Pak. Radney, aku ora bakal nuruti sampeyan. Copot palu iku, utawa delengen dhewe.&#39; Nanging mate predestinated teka isih nyedhaki wong, ngendi Lakeman ngadeg tetep, saiki guncang Pethel abot ing inchi saka untune; sauntara iku mbaleni senar saka maldictions insufferable. Mundur ora bagean sewu saka inch; stabbing wong ing mripat karo poniard unflinching saka Mirit, Steelkilt, clenching tangan tengen konco lan creepingly tarik maneh, marang buron sing yen Pethel nanging grazed pipi kang (Steelkilt) bakal matèni wong. Nanging, para wong bodho, wong bodho kasebut disembelih dening para dewa. Sanalika palu ndemek pipi; enggal sabanjure rahang ngisor mate ana kompor ing sirahe; ambruk ing palka muncrat getih kaya paus.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Sadurungé tangisan kasebut, Steelkilt nggegirisi salah sawijining backstay sing ana ing dhuwur ing ngendi loro kancane padha ngadeg ing masthead. Padha loro Canallers.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;&#39;Canallers!&#39; sesambat Don Pedro. &#39;Kita wis ndeleng akeh kapal paus ing pelabuhan kita, nanging ora tau krungu babagan Canalers sampeyan. Pardon: sapa lan apa?&#39;

Nanging ing dharatan, kabeh effeminacy iki rusak. The brigandish guise kang Canaller supaya bangga olahraga ; topi slouched lan gaily-ribboned betoken fitur grand. A teror kanggo kesucian esem saka desa liwat kang floats; pasuryan swart lan swagger kandel ora unshunned ing kutha. Sawise vagabond ing kanal dhewe, aku wis nampa giliran apik saka salah siji saka Canallers iki; Aku matur nuwun banget; mesthi ora kufur; nanging asring salah siji saka kuwalitas redeeming Perdana saka wong panganiaya sampeyan, sing ing kaping kaku lengen kanggo bali wong liyo miskin ing Selat, minangka njarah-rayah wong sugih.

Uga ora nyuda rasa penasaran babagan perkara iki, manawa kanggo ewonan bocah lanang lan nom-noman pedesaan sing lair ing sadawane garis kasebut, urip percobaan ing Grand Canal nyedhiyakake transisi siji-sijine antarane panen kanthi tenang ing kebon jagung Kristen, lan sembrono mluku banyu segara paling barbar.

       &quot;&#39;Aku weruh! Aku weruh!&#39; impetuously nguwuh Don Pedro, spilling chicha marang ruffles silvery kang. &#39;Ora usah lelungan! Lima ing donya. Saiki aku wis ngira yen ing sisih lormu sing sedheng, generasi-generasi sing adhem lan suci kaya gunung-gunung.-Nanging critane.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Aku mandheg, Pak, ing ngendi Lakeman goyangake backstay. Arang banget wis rampung, nalika dheweke diubengi dening telung bolo junior lan papat harpooneers, sing kabeh crowded wong menyang dek. But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm&#39;s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Come out of that, ye pirates!&#39; roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. &#39;Come out of that, ye cut-throats!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt&#39;s) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?&#39; demanded their ringleader.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!&#39; and he once more raised a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Sink the ship?&#39; cried Steelkilt. &#39;Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say ye, men?&#39; turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.
    </p>
    <p>
       “The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—&#39;It&#39;s not our fault; we didn&#39;t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy&#39;s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw; ain&#39;t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don&#39;t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we&#39;re your men; but we won&#39;t be flogged.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Look ye, now,&#39; cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, &#39;there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the cruise, d&#39;ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don&#39;t want a row; it&#39;s not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won&#39;t be flogged.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Turn to!&#39; roared the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—&#39;I tell you what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won&#39;t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don&#39;t do a hand&#39;s turn.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I&#39;ll keep ye there till ye&#39;re sick of it. Down ye go.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Shall we?&#39; cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
       “As the Lakeman&#39;s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
       “All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
       “At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Better turn to, now?&#39; said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Shut us up again, will ye!&#39; cried Steelkilt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Oh certainly,&#39; said the Captain, and the key clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. &#39;Damn ye,&#39; cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, &#39;the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the whole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;But as for you, ye carrion rogues,&#39; turning to the three men in the rigging—&#39;for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;&#39; and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;My wrist is sprained with ye!&#39; he cried, at last; &#39;but there is still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn&#39;t give up. Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss, &#39;What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I murder you!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me&#39;—and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Best not,&#39; hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;But I must,&#39;—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, &#39;I won&#39;t do it—let him go—cut him down: d&#39;ye hear?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about 
      <i>
        his
      </i>
       being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;You are a coward!&#39; hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;So I am, but take that.&#39; The mate was in the very act of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt&#39;s threat, whatever that might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew. Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the ship&#39;s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt&#39;s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate&#39;s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
       “During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship&#39;s side. In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o&#39;clock, in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;What are you making there?&#39; said a shipmate.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;What do you think? what does it look like?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Like a lanyard for your bag; but it&#39;s an odd one, seems to me.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Yes, rather oddish,&#39; said the Lakeman, holding it at arm&#39;s length before him; &#39;but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven&#39;t enough twine,—have you any?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “But there was none in the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Then I must get some from old Rad;&#39; and he rose to go aft.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;You don&#39;t mean to go a begging to 
      <i>
        him!
      </i>
       &#39; said a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Why not? Do you think he won&#39;t do me a turn, when it&#39;s to help himself in the end, shipmate?&#39; and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman&#39;s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman&#39;s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, &#39;There she rolls! there she rolls!&#39; Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.
    </p>

       “&#39;Moby Dick!&#39; cried Don Sebastian; &#39;St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but that would be too long a story.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;How? how?&#39; cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more into the air, Sirs.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;The chicha! the chicha!&#39; cried Don Pedro; &#39;our vigorous friend looks faint;—fill up his empty glass!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. &#39;The White Whale—the White Whale!&#39; was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate&#39;s got the start; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale&#39;s topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale&#39;s slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Meantime, at the first tap of the boat&#39;s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney&#39;s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary place—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
       “The ship&#39;s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
       “On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;What do you want of me?&#39; cried the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?&#39; demanded Steelkilt; &#39;no lies.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;I am bound to Tahiti for more men.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.&#39; With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;A pretty scholar,&#39; laughed the Lakeman. &#39;Adios, Senor!&#39; and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him. * * * *

    <p>
       “&#39;Are you through?&#39; said Don Sebastian, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;I am, Don.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem to press.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don Sebastian&#39;s suit,&#39; cried the company, with exceeding interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Nay,&#39; said Don Sebastian; &#39;but I know a worthy priest near by, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this may grow too serious.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,&#39; said one of the company to another; &#39;I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       * * * * * *
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,&#39; said Don Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye, gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.&#39;”
