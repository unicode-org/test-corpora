       Aku ninggalake tangi putih lan turbid; banyu pucet, pipi pucet, ngendi aku lelayaran. Billows meri sidelong swell kanggo whelm trek sandi; ayo padha; nanging luwih dhisik aku lulus.

    <p>
       Ing kono, kanthi pinggir goblet sing terus-terusan, ombak sing panas kaya anggur. Alis emas plumbs biru. Srengenge panyilem-alon nyilem wiwit awan-mudhun; jiwaku munggah! dheweke kesel karo gununge sing ora ana watese. Dadi, makutha iku abot banget sing dakanggo? Mahkota Wesi Lombardy iki. Nanging padhang karo akeh permata; Aku sing nganggo, ora weruh kelip-kelip sing adoh; nanging darkly aran aku nganggo sing, sing dazzlingly confounds. Wesi iki - sing aku ngerti - dudu emas. &#39;Tis pamisah, banget-sing aku aran; pinggiran jagged galls kula supaya, otakku misale jek ngalahake marang logam ngalangi; ya, tengkorak baja, tambang; Urut sing ora perlu helem ing perang paling otak-battering!

Cahya sing apik banget iki, dudu cahyaku; kabeh loveliness punika anguish kanggo kula, awit aku ora bisa seneng. Diwenehi pangerten sing dhuwur, aku kekurangan sing kurang, ngrasakake kekuwatan; dikutuk, paling subtly lan paling malignantly! dikutuk ing tengahing Firdaus! Sugeng dalu - sugeng dalu! (

Utawa, yen sampeyan pengin, kaya akeh semut-bukit bubuk, kabeh padha ngadeg ing ngarepku; lan aku sing cocog. Oh, angel! sing kanggo murub wong, match dhewe kudu boroske! Apa sing dakkarepake, dakkarepake; lan apa sing dakkarepake, bakal daklakoni! Padha mikir kula mad-Starbuck ora; nanging aku dhemit, aku madness maddened! Kegilaan liar sing mung tenang kanggo ngerti dhewe! Wangsit iku aku kudu dismembered; lan—Iya! Aku ilang sikil iki. Aku saiki medhar wangsit sing bakal dismember sandi dismemberer. Saiki, dadia nabi lan wong sing netepi. Kuwi ngungkuli kowé, para déwa sing agung. Aku ngguyu lan hoot ing sampeyan, kriket-pemain, sampeyan pugilists, budheg Burkes lan wuta Bendigoes!

Ngapusi aku? kowe ora bisa nylewengake aku, yen ora kowe nylewengake awakmu dhewe! wong wis sampeyan ana. Ngapusi aku? Dalan kanggo tujuanku sing wis ditemtokake wis dipasang kanthi rel wesi, ing kana nyawaku digodhog. Liwat gorges unsounded, liwat ati rifled gunung, ing torrents &#39;kasur, unerringly aku rush! Ora ana alangan, ora ana sudut menyang dalan wesi!

       BAB 41. Moby Dick.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Aku, Ismaèl, iku salah siji saka kru; bengokku wis munggah karo liyane; sumpahku wis digandheng karo sumpahku; lan luwih kuwat aku bengok-bengok, lan liyane aku palu lan clinch sumpahku, amarga saka wedi ing nyawaku. A alam bébas, mistis, perasaan simpatik ana ing kula; Pertengkaran Ahab sing ora bisa diilangi katon dadi aku. Kanthi kuping rakus, aku sinau sejarah monster pembunuh sing aku lan kabeh wong liya wis sumpah kekerasan lan mbales dendam.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kanggo sawetara wektu kepungkur, sanajan mung sawetara wektu, Paus Putih sing ora diiringi, sing terpencil, wis angker ing segara sing ora beradab sing biasane dikunjungi para nelayan Paus Sperma. Nanging ora kabeh padha ngerti orane; mung sawetara wong, comparatively, wis ngerti weruh wong; dene cacahe sing durung bener lan kanthi sengaja menehi perang marang dheweke, mung sithik. Kanggo, amarga jumlah gedhe saka paus-cruisers; cara disorderly padha sprinkled liwat kabeh circumference watery, akeh wong adventurously meksa nindakake perkara nggoleki ing sadawane latitude dhewekan, supaya arang utawa tau kanggo rolas sasi wutuh utawa luwih ing babagan, kanggo nemokke siji sail warta-marang sembarang Urut; dawa inordinate saben lelungan kapisah; irregularity saka kaping sailing saka ngarep; kabeh iki, karo kahanan liyane, langsung lan ora langsung, dawa obstructed panyebaran liwat kabèh donya whaling-armada saka warta individualizing khusus bab Moby Dick. Iku meh ora bisa mangu-mangu, sing sawetara prau kacarita wis ditemoni, ing wektu kuwi utawa kuwi, utawa ing meridian kuwi utawa kuwi, a Sperm Whale gedhene mboten umum lan malignity, kang paus, sawise nindakake piala gedhe marang assailants, wis rampung oncat wong; kanggo sawetara pikiran iku ora anggepan adil, Aku ngomong, sing paus ing pitakonan kudu ora liya saka Moby Dick. Nanging ing pungkasan perikanan Paus Sperma wis ditandhani dening macem-macem lan ora kerep kedadeyan saka ferocity gedhe, licik, lan jahat ing monster nyerang; mulane iku, wong-wong sing ora sengaja menehi perang marang Moby Dick; Pamburu kuwi, mbok menawa, kanggo sisih paling, padha isi kanggo ascribe teror aneh kang dikembangke, liyane, minangka, kanggo perils saka Fishery Whale Sperma ing gedhe, saka sabab individu. Ing cara sing, biasane, temu bencana antarane Ahab lan paus wis dianggep populer.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lan kanggo wong-wong sing, sadurunge krungu saka Paus Putih, dening kasempatan kejiret ngarsane; ing awal bab padha saben siji saka wong-wong mau, meh, minangka wani lan fearlessly sudo kanggo wong, minangka kanggo paus liyane spesies sing. Nanging suwe-suwe, kacilakan kasebut kedadeyan ing serangan kasebut - ora mung ing bangkekan lan tungkak sing sprained, anggota awak sing rusak, utawa amputasi sing mangan - nanging fatal nganti fatal pungkasan; sing bola-bali repulses bilai, kabeh accumulating lan piling terrors marang Moby Dick; iku wis adoh kanggo goyangake kakuwatane akeh pamburu wani, kang crita Paus Putih wis pungkasanipun teka.
    </p>
    <p>
       Uga ora ana gosip liar sing ora bisa dibesar-besarkan, lan isih luwih nggegirisi sejarah sing sejatine saka pertemuan sing mateni iki. Kanggo ora mung gosip apik alamiah tuwuh metu saka banget awak kabeh acara elek ngageti,-minangka wit smitten nglairake jamur sawijining; nanging, ing urip maritim, luwih akeh tinimbang ing terra firma, gosip liar akeh, ing ngendi wae ana kasunyatan sing nyukupi kanggo dheweke. Lan kaya segara ngungkuli dharatan ing prakara iki, mangkono uga iwak paus ngluwihi kabeh jinis urip maritim liyane, ing endah lan wedi saka gosip sing kadhangkala nyebar ing kono. Kanggo ora mung whalemen minangka awak unexempt saka nggatekke lan superstitiousness turun temurun kanggo kabeh pelaut; nanging kabeh pelaut, padha dening kabeh rintangan paling langsung digawa menyang kontak karo apa wae appallingly ngeramaken ing segara; adhep-adhepan padha ora mung mripat sawijining marvels paling gedhe, nanging, tangan kanggo rahang, menehi perang kanggo wong-wong mau. Piyambak, ing banyu adoh kaya, sing sanadyan sampeyan lelayaran ewu mil, lan liwat ewu gisik, sampeyan ora bakal teka ing sembarang chiseled hearth-watu, utawa sembarang grapyak ing ngisor bagean srengenge; ing latitudes lan longitudes kuwi, nguber banget panggilan kaya mengkono, whaleman kebungkus dening pengaruh kabeh cenderung kanggo nggawe kang apik ngandhut karo akeh kuwoso lair.
    </p>
    <p>
       Mula, ora nggumunake, yen volume ngumpulake saka transit mung ing papan sing paling jembar, desas-desus babagan Paus Putih pungkasane nggabungake kabeh pitunjuk sing ora sehat, lan saran-saran fœtal sing setengah dibentuk saka agensi supernatural, sing pungkasanipun nandur modhal Moby Dick karo teror anyar unborrowed saka apa-apa sing katon katon. Dadi, ing pirang-pirang kasus, dheweke pungkasane ngalami gupuh, sing mung sawetara sing krungu kabar babagan Paus Putih, sawetara wong sing mburu sing gelem nemoni bebaya rahang.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nanging isih ana pengaruh praktis liyane lan luwih penting ing karya. Malah saiki ora duwe prestise asli Paus Sperma, sing dibedakake kanthi wedi karo kabeh spesies leviathan liyane, mati saka pikirane para whalemen minangka awak. Ana sing dina iki antarane wong-wong mau, sing, sanadyan cerdas lan cukup wani ing kurban perang kanggo Greenland utawa Paus tengen, bakal mbok menawa-salah siji saka inexperience profesional, utawa incompetency, utawa timidity, nolak kontes karo Paus Sperma; ing sembarang tingkat, ana akeh whalemen, utamané ing antarane bangsa whaling ora sailing ing gendéra Amérika, sing wis tau musuhan ketemu Whale Sperma, nanging kawruh sawijine leviathan diwatesi kanggo monster ignoble primitively ngoyak ing Lor; lungguh ing hatches, wong-wong iki bakal ngrungokake karo kapentingan fireside childish lan kagum, kanggo alam bébas, dongeng aneh saka paus Kidul. Utawa tremendousness pinunjul saka Paus Sperma gedhe ngendi wae liyane feelingly comprehendly, saka ing Papan sing prows kang stem wong.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lan kaya-kaya kasunyatan sing saiki wis diuji kekuwatane ing jaman biyen legendaris mbuwang bayangane sadurunge; kita nemokake sawetara naturalis buku-Olassen lan Povelson-ngumumaké Paus Sperma ora mung dadi consternation kanggo saben titah liyane ing segara, nanging uga dadi luar biasa galak minangka terus-terusan ngelak kanggo getih manungsa. Malah nganti pungkasan wektu Cuvier, kesan iki utawa meh padha diilangi. Amarga ing Sejarah Alame, Baron dhewe negesake manawa nalika ndeleng Paus Sperma, kabeh iwak (kalebu hiu) &quot;ditemokake kanthi teror sing paling rame,&quot; lan &quot;asring ing precipitancy penerbangan dheweke mlayu nglawan watu kaya ngono. kekerasan sing nyebabake pati langsung.&quot; Nanging, pengalaman umum ing perikanan bisa ngowahi laporan kaya iki; nanging ing terribleness lengkap sing, malah kanggo item ngelak getih saka Povelson, kapercayan superstitious ing wong-wong mau, ing sawetara vicissitudes panggilan sing, revived ing atine saka Pamburu.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dadi kaget karo desas-desus lan pratandha babagan dheweke, ora sawetara nelayan sing ngelingi, ing referensi kanggo Moby Dick, dina sadurunge perikanan Paus Sperma, nalika asring angel ngindhuksi para whalemen Kanan sing wis suwe dipraktekke kanggo mlebu ing bebaya. perang anyar lan wani iki; wong kuwi protes sing sanajan leviathans liyane muga-muga bisa ngoyak, nanging kanggo Chase lan nunjuk lance ing penampakan kaya Paus Sperma ora kanggo manungsa fana. Sing nyoba iku, mesthi bakal ambruk menyang kalanggengan cepet. Ing sirah iki, ana sawetara dokumen sing luar biasa sing bisa dikonsultasi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nanging, sawetara ana, sing malah ing pasuryan saka iku padha siyap kanggo mburu Moby Dick; lan isih luwih akeh sing, mung bisa krungu babagan dheweke kanthi adoh lan samar-samar, tanpa rincian tartamtu saka bilai tartamtu, lan tanpa iringan superstitious, cukup hardy ora kanggo mlayu saka perang yen ditawakake.
    </p>
    <p>
       Salah saran alam bébas diarani, minangka pungkasan teka kanggo disambung karo Paus Putih ing atine superstitiously kepekso, ana conceit unearthly sing Moby Dick ana ngendi wae; yen dheweke pancen wis ditemoni ing garis lintang sing ngelawan ing wektu sing padha.
    </p>
    <p>
       Utawa, ora bisa dipercaya kaya pikiran kaya ngono, yaiku kesombongan iki tanpa nuduhake kemungkinan superstitious. Kanggo minangka rahasia saka arus ing segara durung tau divulgar, malah kanggo riset paling erudite; supaya cara sing didhelikake Paus Sperma nalika ana ing sangisore permukaan tetep, sebagéyan gedhé, ora tanggung jawab marang para pamburu; lan saka wektu kanggo wektu wis asal saka spekulasi paling penasaran lan mbantah bab mau, utamané bab modus mistik kang, sawise muni kanggo ambane gedhe, transports piyambak karo swiftness banget kanggo titik paling wiyar adoh.
    </p>
    <p>
       Bab iki uga dikenal kanggo kapal paus Amerika lan Inggris, lan uga ana ing rekaman resmi taun kepungkur dening Scoresby, manawa sawetara paus wis dicekel adoh ing sisih lor ing Pasifik, sing badane ditemokake barbs saka harpoons darted ing segara Greenland. Uga ora bisa dipungkiri manawa ing sawetara kasus kasebut wis diumumake manawa interval wektu antarane serangan loro kasebut ora bisa ngluwihi pirang-pirang dina. Mula, kanthi inferensi, sawetara wong whalemen percaya yen Nor&#39; West Passage, dadi masalah kanggo manungsa, ora tau dadi masalah kanggo paus. Dadi ing kene, ing pengalaman nyata urip wong urip, prodigies related ing jaman kuna saka pedalaman gunung Strello ing Portugal (cedhak kang ndhuwur ana ngandika tlaga kang wrecks kapal floated munggah menyang lumahing); lan crita sing isih luwih apik babagan banyu mancur Arethusa cedhak Syracuse (kang banyune diyakini asale saka Tanah Suci kanthi dalan lemah); narasi apik iki meh padha karo kasunyatan saka whalemen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dipeksa dadi akrab, banjur, karo prodigies kaya iki; lan ngerti yen sawise bola-bali, serangan intrepid, Paus Putih wis oncat urip; iku ora bisa dadi akeh prakara kaget sing sawetara whalemen kudu pindhah luwih ing superstitions sing; ngumumake Moby Dick ora mung ana ing endi wae, nanging langgeng (amarga kaabadian iku ana ing ngendi-endi ing wektu); sanadyan groves tumbak kudu ditandur ing flanks, kang isih bakal nglangi adoh tanpa tatu; utawa yen pancen dheweke bakal digawe kanggo spout getih kandel, pandelengan kuwi bakal mung ngapusi ghastly; kanggo maneh ing unensanguined billows atusan liga adoh, jet unsullied kang sepisan maneh bakal katon.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nanging malah diudani surmisings adikodrati iki, ana cukup ing kadonyan nggawe lan karakter incontestable monster kanggo nyerang bayangan karo daya unwonted. Amarga, ora akeh sing ora umum sing mbedakake dheweke saka paus sperma liyane, nanging, kaya sing dibuwang ing papan liya - bathuk kerut salju putih sing aneh, lan bonggol putih sing dhuwur lan piramida. Iki minangka fitur sing misuwur; pratandha kang, sanajan ing segara tanpa wates, uncharted, kang mbukak jati diri, ing kadohan adoh, kanggo wong-wong sing ngerti.
    </p>
    <p>
       Liyane saka awak iki supaya streaked, lan kesawang, lan marmer karo hue shrouded padha, sing, ing pungkasan, wis gained appellation khusu saka Paus Putih; jeneng, tenan, secara harfiah sabdho dening aspek urip, nalika katon gliding ing dhuwur noon liwat segara biru peteng, ninggalake milky-way tangi saka umpluk ono krime, kabeh spangled karo Golden gleamings.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ora ana gedhene sing ora biasa, utawa warna sing luar biasa, utawa rahang ngisor sing cacat, sing nggawe paus kasebut kanthi teror alam, kayadene keganasan sing ora ana conto lan cerdas sing, miturut akun tartamtu, dheweke wis bola-bali dibuktekake. serangan kang. Luwih saka kabeh, undur-undur sing cidra luwih nyenengake tinimbang liyane. Amarga, nalika nglangi ing ngarepe wong-wong sing ngoyak-oyak, kanthi gejala weker sing katon, dheweke wis kaping pirang-pirang dikawruhi kanthi tiba-tiba, lan, nuli mudhun marang wong-wong mau, bisa numpes prau menyang serpihan, utawa nuli bali menyang kapal. .
    </p>
    <p>
       Wis pirang-pirang korban jiwa sing ngoyak dheweke. Nanging sanadyan bilai padha, sanadyan sethitik bruited ing dharat, padha ora liya mboten umum ing perikanan; Nanging, ing paling kedadean, kuwi ketoke infernal Paus Putih kang aforethought saka ferocity, sing saben dismembering utawa pati sing nyebabake, iki ora wholly dianggep minangka Duwe inflicted dening agen unintelligent.
    </p>
    <p>
       Hakim, banjur, apa pitches saka inflamed, distracted ngamuk pikirane sing luwih nekat Pamburu padha impelled, nalika ing kupeng kripik prau chewed, lan perangan awak kleleb kanca ambruk, padha nglangi metu saka putih dadi putih saka bebendune paus. menyang serene, suryo srengenge exasperating, sing mesem ing, kaya ing lair utawa bridal.
    </p>
    <p>
       Telu prauné stove watara wong, lan dayung lan wong loro whirling ing eddies; siji kapten, ngrebut line-pisau saka prow rusak, wis mlayu ing paus, minangka Arkansas duellist ing mungsuh, wuta seeking karo lading enem inci kanggo nggayuh urip fathom-jero paus. Kapten iku Ahab. Banjur iku, sing dumadakan nyapu rahang ngisor arit-shaped ngisor dheweke, Moby Dick wis reaped adoh Ahab wentis, minangka mower agul-agul saka suket ing lapangan. Ora ana wong Turki sing nganggo turban, ora ana wong Venesia utawa Melayu sing disewa, sing bisa nyerang dheweke kanthi rasa jahat sing luwih katon. Alasan cilik ana kanggo mangu-mangu, mula, wiwit ketemu sing meh fatal, Ahab wis ngurmati dendam liar marang paus kasebut, luwih-luwih amarga amarga penyakite sing nggegirisi, dheweke pungkasane ora kenal karo dheweke, ora mung kabeh dheweke. kasusahan jasmani, nanging kabeh exasperations intelektual lan spiritual. Paus Putih nglangi sadurunge dheweke minangka inkarnasi monomaniak saka kabeh agensi jahat sing dirasakake dening sawetara wong jero, nganti ditinggal urip kanthi setengah jantung lan paru-paru. Sing malignity intangible kang wis saka wiwitan; kanggo kang dominasi malah Kristen modern ascribe siji-setengah saka donya; kang kuna Ophites saka wétan reverenced ing reca Iblis;-Ahab ora sujud lan nyembah kaya wong-wong mau; nanging deliriously nransfer idea kanggo paus putih abhorred, kang pitted piyambak, kabeh mutilated, marang iku. Kabeh sing paling maddens lan torments; kabeh sing ngojok-ojoki barang-barang; kabeh bebener karo ala; kabeh sing retak otot lan jajan otak; kabeh demonisms subtle urip lan pikiran; kabeh ala, kanggo Ahab edan, padha katon personified, lan digawe prakteke assailable ing Moby Dick. Panjenenganipun numpuk marang paus kang putih hump jumlah kabeh nesu umum lan sengit felt dening kabeh lomba saka Adam mudhun; banjur, kaya dhadhane wis dadi lesung, dheweke nyemburake cangkang atine sing panas.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ora mungkin monomania ing dheweke mundhak cepet ing wektu sing tepat nalika dismemberment awak. Banjur, ing darting ing monster, piso ing tangan, nanging wis ngeculke kanggo dadakan, hasrat, memungsuhan kopral; lan nalika nampa stroke sing nyuwék wong, mbokmenawa felt laceration ono sesambungan karo badan agonizing, nanging ora luwih. Nanging, nalika tabrakan iki dipeksa kanggo nguripake menyang ngarep, lan kanggo sasi suwene dina lan minggu, Ahab lan anguish lay digawe dowo bebarengan ing siji hammock, rounding ing agêng mangsa sing dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; banjur iku, sing awak ambruk lan nyawa gashed bled menyang siji liyane; lan supaya interfusing, digawe wong mad. Iku mung banjur, ing lelungan mulih, sawise ketemu, sing monomania pungkasan ngrebut dheweke, katon kabeh nanging mesthi saka kasunyatan sing, ing interval sak wacana, dheweke iku wong edan raving; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun&#39;sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man&#39;s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab&#39;s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab&#39;s broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.
    </p>
    <p>
       This is much; yet Ahab&#39;s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man&#39;s upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him.
    </p>
    <p>
       The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
       Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a Job&#39;s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man&#39;s ire—by what evil magic their souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.

       CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.
    </h2>
    <p>
       What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.
    </p>
    <p>
       Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any man&#39;s soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.

       Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants” above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble things—the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.
    </p>
    <p>
       This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*
    </p>
    <p>
       *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified terror.
    </p>
    <p>
       As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence 
      <i>
        Requiem
      </i>
       denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him 
      <i>
        Requin
      </i>
       .
    </p>
    <p>
       Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God&#39;s great, unflattering laureate, Nature.*
    </p>
    <p>
       *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king&#39;s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman&#39;s name for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge&#39;s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
       I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round its neck, with the ship&#39;s time and place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!
    </p>
    <p>
       Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.
    </p>
    <p>
       But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross.
    </p>
    <p>
       What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears. The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive deformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place!
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.
    </p>
    <p>
       Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
       But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness—though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?
    </p>
    <p>
       Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to recall them now.
    </p>
    <p>
       Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
    </p>
    <p>
       Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its neighbors—the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia&#39;s Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “the tall pale man” of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can&#39;st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.
    </p>
    <p>
       I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples.
    </p>
    <p>
       First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.
    </p>
    <p>
       But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?
    </p>
    <p>
       No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.
    </p>
    <p>
       Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
    </p>
    <p>
       Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
    </p>
    <p>
       But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian&#39;s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
       Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?
