       BAB 10. Kanca Pangkur.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Bali menyang Spouter-Inn saka Kapel, Aku ketemu Queequeg ana cukup piyambak; dheweke wis ninggalake Kapel sadurunge benediction sawetara wektu. Dheweke lungguh ing bangku sadurunge geni, kanthi sikile ing kompor, lan ing tangan siji nyekeli brahala cilik negro kasebut ing pasuryane; ngintip-ngintip pasuryane, lan karo piso jack alon-alon ngethok irunge, sauntara humming dhewe ing cara kang kafir.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nanging saiki diselani, kang sijine munggah gambar; lan cantik rauh, arep meja, njupuk munggah buku gedhe ana, lan diselehake ing puteran wiwit ngetang kaca kanthi teratur disengojo; ing saben kaca kaping seket - kaya sing dakkarepake - mandheg sedhela, katon kosong ing saubengé, lan ngucapake singsot gurgling sing dawa banget. Dheweke banjur bakal miwiti maneh ing sèket sabanjuré; Katon wiwit ing nomer siji saben-saben, kaya-kaya ora bisa ngetung luwih saka seket, lan mung kanthi jumlah seket sing ditemokake bebarengan, sing gumun ing akeh kaca sing bungah.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kanthi akeh minat aku lungguh nonton dheweke. Savage sanadyan dheweke, lan ndhelikake babagan pasuryan - paling ora kanggo rasaku - praupane durung ana sing ora disenengi. Sampeyan ora bisa ndhelikake jiwa. Liwat kabeh tattooings unearthly kang, Aku panginten aku weruh ngambah saka ati jujur ​​prasaja; lan ing mripate sing gedhe lan jero, ireng sing murub lan kendel, katon ana tandha-tandha roh sing bakal wani sewu setan. Lan saliyane kabeh iki, ana prekara sing dhuwur banget babagan wong Pagan, sing sanajan ora sopan ora bisa ngilangi kabeh. Dheweke katon kaya wong sing ora tau cringed lan ora duwe utang. Apa iku, banget, sing sirah kang dicukur, bathuk iki digambar metu ing relief freer lan padhang, lan katon luwih expansive saka iku digunakake, iki aku ora bakal sukan arep; nanging tartamtu iku sirah iku phrenologically apik banget. Iku bisa uga katon ridiculous, nanging ngilingake kula ing sirah Umum Washington kang, minangka katon ing busts populer saka wong. Wis padha dawa ajeg gradasi slope mundur saka ndhuwur alis, kang uga banget projecting, kaya rong tanjung dawa kandel wooded ing ndhuwur. Queequeg yaiku George Washington sing dikembangake sacara kanibal.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nalika aku iki rapet mindhai wong, setengah-nyamar Kangge looking metu ing badai saka casement, dheweke ora tau heeded sandi ngarsane, tau alangan piyambak karo dadi luwih minangka Mirit siji; nanging katon wutuh dikuwasani karo ngetung kaca saka buku apik tenan. Ngelingi carane sociably kita wis turu bebarengan ing wengi sadurunge, lan utamané considering lengen affectionate aku wis ketemu di buwang liwat kula nalika tangi ing esuk, Aku panginten iki indifference kang banget aneh. Nanging wong galak iku makhluk aneh; ing kaping sampeyan ora ngerti persis carane njupuk. Ing kawitan padha overawing; sing kalem poto-collectedness saka gamblang misale jek kawicaksanan Socratic. Aku wis ngeweruhi uga sing Queequeg tau consorted ing kabeh, utawa nanging banget sethitik, karo seamen liyane ing penginapan. Dheweke ora nggawe kemajuan apa wae; katon ora duwe kepinginan kanggo nggedhekake bunderan kanca-kancane. Kabeh iki disabetake kula minangka kuwoso tunggal; durung, marang pikiran liyane, ana soko meh sublim ing. Ing kene ana wong sing kira-kira rong puluh ewu mil saka omah, kanthi cara Cape Horn, yaiku - mung siji-sijine cara dheweke bisa tekan kono - dibuwang ing antarane wong sing aneh kaya dheweke ana ing planet Jupiter; lan durung ketoke tanggung ing ease; njaga katentreman paling; isi karo kancane dhewe; tansah padha karo awake dhewe. Mesthi iki minangka sentuhan filsafat sing apik; sanadyan ora mangu-mangu dheweke ora tau krungu ana sing kaya mangkono. Nanging, mbok menawa, dadi filsuf sejati, kita manungsa ora kudu ngerti babagan urip utawa usaha. Sanalika aku krungu manawa wong kaya ngono menehi awake dhewe kanggo filsuf, aku nyimpulake yen, kaya wong wadon tuwa sing dyspeptik, dheweke mesthi &quot;rusak digester.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Nalika aku lungguh ana ing kamar sing saiki sepi; geni kobong kurang, ing tataran entheng nalika, sawise kakiyatan pisanan wis warmed udhara, banjur mung cemlorot kanggo katon ing; iyub-iyub sore lan phantoms kumpul watara casements, lan peering ing marang kita bisu, dhewekan loro; badai booming tanpa ing swells solemn; Aku wiwit ngerti perasaan aneh. Aku felt leleh ing kula. Ora ana maneh atiku sing pecah lan tangan sing nggegirisi dibalik marang jagad serigala. Wong galak sing nyenengake iki wis nebus. Ing kana dheweke lungguh, banget indifference ngandika alam kang ana lurked ora hypocrisies beradab lan ngapusi hambar. Wild dheweke; pandelengan banget kanggo ndeleng; nanging aku wiwit aran dhewe misterius ditarik menyang wong. Lan iku padha sing bakal repelled paling liyane, padha banget wesi sembrani sing mangkono narik kawigaten kula. Aku bakal nyoba kanca pagan, panginten aku, awit kebecikan Kristen wis mbuktekaken nanging courtesy kothong. Aku narik bangku cedhak dheweke, lan nggawe sawetara pratandha lan pitunjuk sing ramah, ngupayakake sing paling apik kanggo ngobrol karo dheweke. Ing wiwitan, dheweke ora weruh kemajuan kasebut; nanging saiki, marang aku referring menyang Hospitalities pungkasan wengi kang, kang digawe metu kanggo takon kula apa kita padha maneh bedfellows. Aku marang wong ya; ngendi aku panginten kang katon pleased, mbok menawa sethitik muji.
    </p>
    <p>
       Aku banjur nguripake buku bebarengan, lan aku nyoba kanggo nerangake marang tujuan printing, lan makna saka sawetara gambar sing ana ing. Mangkono aku rauh melu kapentingan kang; lan saka iku kita lunga menyang jabbering paling kita bisa babagan macem-macem pandelengan njaba kanggo katon ing kutha misuwur iki. Rauh aku ngajokaken asap sosial; lan, mrodhuksi kantong lan tomahawk, kang quietly ana kula puff. Banjur kita lungguh ijol-ijolan puffs saka pipo alam bébas kang, lan tetep ajeg liwat antarane kita.
    </p>
    <p>
       Yen durung ana es indifference marang aku ing dhadha Pagan, asap genial sing nyenengake iki, enggal-enggal thawed metu, lan ninggalake kita kroni. Panjenenganipun ketoke kanggo njupuk kula cukup minangka alamiah lan unbiddenly kaya aku marang; lan nalika kumelun kita liwat, dheweke menet bathuk menyang mine, clasped kula sak bangkekan, lan ngandika wiwit saiki kita wis nikah; tegesipun, ing tembung negara kang, sing kita padha bosom kanca; dheweke bakal seneng mati kanggo aku, yen perlu. Ing negarane, semangat kekancan sing tiba-tiba iki katon durung wayahe, sing ora bisa dipercaya; nanging ing galak prasaja iki aturan lawas ora bakal ditrapake.
    </p>
    <p>
       Sawise nedha bengi, lan obrolan sosial liyane lan ngrokok, kita menyang kamar bebarengan. Dhèwèké paring pisungsung marang aku saka sirahé sing dibalsem; njupuk dhompet rokok sing gedhe banget, lan groping ing ngisor rokok, narik dhuwit perak telung puluh dolar; banjur nyebar ing meja, lan mechanically dibagi dadi loro bagean witjaksono, di-push siji menyang kula, lan ngandika iku mine. Aku arep mbantah; nanging dheweke nggawe aku bisu kanthi diwutahake menyang kanthong celanaku. Aku supaya padha tetep. Dheweke banjur nindakake shalat magrib, njupuk brahalane, lan nyopot papan geni kertas. Miturut pratandha lan gejala tartamtu, Aku panginten kang ketoke kuatir kanggo kula kanggo nggabungake wong; nanging ngerti apa sing bakal ditindakake, aku mikir sedhela apa, yen dheweke ngajak aku, aku bakal nuruti utawa ora.
    </p>
    <p>
       Aku iki Kristen apik; lair lan dikembangke ing pangkone Gréja Presbyterian infallible. Kepiye carane aku bisa nyawiji karo penyembah brahala liar iki ing nyembah kayu? Nanging apa ibadah? panginten I. Apa sampeyan ngira saiki, Ismael, sing agung Gusti Allah langit lan bumi-kafir lan kabeh klebu-bisa bisa cemburu dicokot sepele saka kayu ireng? mokal! Nanging apa iku ibadah? - kanggo nindakake kersane Gusti - 
      <i>
        yaiku
      </i>
       ibadah. Lan apa kersané Gusti Allah? - kanggo nindakaké apa sing dakkarepaké marang wong liya - 
      <i>
        iku
      </i>
       kersané Gusti Allah. Saiki, Queequeg dadi kancaku. Lan apa aku pengin sing Queequeg iki bakal nindakake kanggo kula? Yagene, gabung karo aku ing ibadah Presbyterian tartamtu. Akibate, aku banjur kudu nyawiji karo dheweke ing; mulane, aku kudu nyembah brahala. Dadi aku nyedhot cukur; nulungi brahala cilik sing ora lugu; nawakake biskuit obaran karo Queequeg; salamed sadurunge wong kaping pindho utawa telu; ngambung irung; lan sing rampung, kita undressed lan banjur turu, ing tentrem karo kalbu dhewe lan kabeh donya. Nanging kita ora turu tanpa ngobrol sethithik.
    </p>
    <p>
       Carane iku aku ora ngerti; nanging ora ana panggonan kaya amben kanggo pambocoran rahasia antarane kanca. Wong lanang lan bojo, padha ngomong, ana mbukak dhasar banget nyawa kanggo saben liyane; lan sawetara pasangan lawas asring ngapusi lan ngobrol liwat wektu lawas nganti meh esuk. Mangkono, banjur, ing bulan madu ing ati, aku lan Queequeg - pasangan sing nyenengake lan tresna.

       BAB 11. Sandhangan turu.
    </h2>
    <p>
       We wis liyane mangkono ing amben, petung lan napping ing interval cendhak, lan Queequeg saiki banjur affectionately uncalan coklat sikil tato liwat mine, lan banjur teken maneh; dadi tanggung sociable lan free lan gampang padha kita; nalika, ing pungkasan, kanthi alesan confabulations kita, apa nappishness sethitik tetep ing kita kabeh budhal, lan kita felt kaya tangi maneh, sanadyan dina-break isih sawetara cara mudhun mangsa.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ya, kita dadi banget wakeful; dadi luwih supaya posisi recumbent kita wiwit tansaya lemes, lan sethitik lan sethitik kita ketemu dhéwé lungguh munggah; sandhangane uga dicemplungake ing sakubenge kita, nyandhak ing papan sirah kanthi dhengkul papat ditarik cedhak bebarengan, lan irung kita loro mlengkung, kaya-kaya kneepan kita minangka panci pemanasan. We felt banget becik lan snug, liyane supaya wiwit iku dadi chilly metu saka lawang; pancen metu saka amben uga, weruh yen ing kamar ora ana geni. Luwih-luwih, aku kandha, amarga sejatine kanggo ngrasakake anget awak, sawetara bagean cilik sampeyan kudu adhem, amarga ora ana kualitas ing jagad iki sing ora mung kontras. Boten wonten ing piyambak. Yen sampeyan ngapusi dhewe yen sampeyan wis kepenak, lan wis suwe, mula sampeyan ora bisa diarani kepenak maneh. Nanging yen, kaya Queequeg lan aku ing amben, pucuk irung utawa makutha sirahmu rada adhem, kok banjur, ing eling umum, sampeyan aran paling nyenengake lan anget. Mulane, apartemen turu kudu ora dilengkapi geni, sing minangka salah sawijining rasa ora nyaman kanggo wong sugih. Kanggo dhuwur iki Urut saka deliciousness ora duwe apa-apa nanging kemul antarane sampeyan lan snugness lan kadhemen saka udhara njaba. Banjur ana sampeyan ngapusi kaya cemlorot sing anget ing jantung kristal Arktik.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kita wis sawetara wektu lungguh ing cara crouching iki, nalika kabeh bebarengan aku panginten aku bakal mbukak mripatku; amarga nalika antarane sprei, apa ing wayah awan utawa wengi, lan apa turu utawa tangi, aku duwe cara kanggo tansah nutup mripat, supaya luwih konsentrasi snugness ing amben. Amarga ora ana wong sing bisa ngrasakake identitas dhewe kanthi bener kajaba mripate ditutup; kaya-kaya pepeteng pancen minangka unsur esensi kita, sanajan cahya luwih cocog karo bagean lempung kita. Sawise mbukak mripatku, lan metu saka pepeteng sing nyenengake lan nggawe dhewe menyang surem njaba sing ora ana ing jam rolas wengi, aku ngalami rasa ora seneng. Aku uga ora mbantah pitunjuk saka Queequeg, mbok menawa paling apik kanggo nyorot cahya, amarga kita padha siyaga; lan malih kang felt kepinginan kuwat kanggo duwe puffs sepi sawetara saka Tomahawk kang. Dadi ngandika, sing sanadyan aku wis felt kuwi repugnancy kuwat marang udud ing amben wengi sadurunge, durung weruh carane lentur kita kaku prejudices tuwuh nalika katresnan sapisan teka kanggo bend wong. Saiki aku ora seneng karo Queequeg ngrokok ing sisihku, sanajan ana ing amben, amarga dheweke katon kebak kabungahan kluwarga sing tenang. Aku ora ngrasa kuwatir babagan kabijakan asuransi sing duwe omah. Aku mung urip kanggo comfortness rahasia condensed nuduhake pipa lan kemul karo kanca nyata. Kanthi jaket shaggy kita digambar ing pundhak kita, saiki kita ngliwati Tomahawk saka siji menyang liyane, nganti alon-alon ana tester kumelun gantung biru, sing dipadhangi dening geni lampu sing anyar.

Dheweke seneng manut. Sanadyan ing wektu iku aku ora ngerti sawetara tembung, nanging pambocoran sakteruse, nalika aku wis dadi luwih akrab karo fraseologi sing rusak, saiki aku bisa nyritakake kabeh crita kaya sing bisa dibuktekake ing kerangka sing dakwenehake.

       BAB 12. Biografi.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Queequeg asalé saka Rokovoko, sawijining pulo sing adoh ing sisih kulon lan kidul. Ora ana ing peta apa wae; panggonan bener tau.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nalika wong galak anyar-netes mlaku-mlaku liar ing alas asli ing clout suket, ngiring dening nibbling wedhus, minangka yen padha sapling ijo; malah banjur, ing jiwa ambisi Queequeg kang, lurked kepinginan kuwat kanggo ndeleng soko liyane Christendom saka whaler spesimen utawa loro. Bapake iku Lurah Agung, Raja; pamane iku Imam Agung; lan ing sisih ibu dheweke gumunggung bibi sing dadi garwane prajurit sing ora bisa dikalahake. Ana getih apik banget ing vena-barang kraton; sanadyan susah vitiated, Aku wedi, dening propensity kanibal kang nourished ing muda untutored kang.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kapal Pelabuhan Sag ngunjungi teluk bapake, lan Queequeg ngupaya dalan menyang tanah Kristen. Nanging kapal, gadhah dheweke lengkap nglengkapi seamen, spurned setelan; lan ora kabeh Raja pengaruhe kang rama bisa menang. Nanging Queequeg sumpah. Piyambakipun ing kano, kang paddled mati menyang selat adoh, kang ngerti kapal kudu liwat nalika dheweke quitted pulo. Ing sisih siji ana terumbu karang; ing sisih liyane basa lemah, ditutupi karo grumbulan mangrove sing thukul metu menyang banyu. Ndhelikake sampane, isih kumambang, ing antarane grumbulan iki, kanthi prow menyang segara, lungguh ing buritan, dayung ing tangan; lan nalika kapal wis ngleyang liwat, kaya lampu kilat dheweke darted metu; gained dheweke sisih; karo siji mlayu mundur saka sikile capsed lan tenggelam kano; minggah rante; lan mbuwang piyambak ing dawa lengkap ing kelompok, grappled ring-bolt ana, lan sumpah ora supaya pindhah, sanadyan disusupi ing bêsik.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tanpa guna kapten ngancam arep mbuwang dheweke menyang segara; digantung cutlass liwat bangkekan wuda; Queequeg iku putra saka Raja, lan Queequeg ora budged. Disabetake dening rasa nekat, lan kepinginan liar kanggo ngunjungi Christendom, kapten pungkasane gelem, lan ujar manawa dheweke bisa uga ana ing omah. Nanging bocah galak sing apik iki - Pangeran Wales segara, ora tau weruh kabin Kapten. Dheweke dilebokake ing antarane para pelaut, lan didadekake paus. Nanging kaya Czar Peter sing seneng nyambut gawe ing galangan kapal ing kutha-kutha manca, Queequeg ora ngremehake, yen kanthi seneng bisa entuk kekuwatan kanggo nylametake wong-wong sing ora ngerti. Kanggo ing ngisor - supaya dheweke kandha marang aku - dheweke digerakake dening kepinginan banget kanggo sinau ing antarane wong-wong Kristen, seni sing ndadekake umate isih luwih seneng tinimbang saiki; lan luwih saka iku, isih luwih apik saka iku. Nanging, ala! laku saka whalemen rauh nggawe percoyo wong sing malah Kristen bisa dadi loro sengsara lan duraka; tanpa wates luwih saka kabeh wong kapir bapakne. Teka ing pungkasan ing Sag Harbour lawas; lan ndeleng apa sing ditindakaké para pelaut ana ing kono; lan banjur menyang Nantucket, lan weruh carane padha nglampahi upah ing panggonan 
      <i>
        iku
      </i>
       uga, miskin Queequeg nyerah kanggo ilang. Panginten kang, iku donya duraka ing kabeh meridian; Aku bakal mati pagan.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lan kanthi mangkono dadi nyembah brahala lawas, dheweke isih urip ing antarane wong-wong Kristen iki, nganggo sandhangane, lan nyoba ngomong babagan omong kosong. Dadi cara sing aneh babagan dheweke, sanajan saiki sawetara wektu saka omah.
    </p>
    <p>
       Miturut diwenehi, Aku takon marang apa ora propose bali, lan duwe penobatan; amarga dheweke saiki bisa nganggep bapake wis mati lan ora ana, dheweke wis tuwa banget lan ringkih ing akun pungkasan. Dheweke mangsuli ora, durung; lan nambahake menawa dheweke iku Kristen wedi, utawa luwih Kristen, wis unfitted wong kanggo munggah tahta murni lan undefiled saka telung puluh Raja pagan sadurunge wong. Nanging mengko, dheweke kandha, dheweke bakal bali, - sanalika dheweke rumangsa dibaptis maneh. Nanging, kanggo nonce, dheweke ngusulake kanggo lelayaran, lan nyebar gandum liar ing papat samudra. Dheweke wis nggawe harpooneer saka dheweke, lan wesi barbed iki minangka pengganti scepter saiki.
    </p>
    <p>
       Aku takon marang apa sing bisa dadi tujuan langsung, ndemek obahe mangsa ngarep. Wangsulane, menyang segara maneh, ing pagawean lawas. Sawise iki, aku ngandhani yen perburuan paus minangka rancanganku dhewe, lan ngandhani babagan niatku kanggo numpak kapal metu saka Nantucket, minangka pelabuhan sing paling janjeni kanggo petualang sing bakal teka. Enggal-enggal mantun nêdya ndhèrèk dhatêng pulo wau, kapal ing kapal ingkang sami, nêdya ing panjagan sami, prau ingkang sami, rêkaos sami kula, têgêsipun kongsi saben hap; karo loro tangan ing, kandel dicelupake menyang Potluck loro donya. Kanggo kabeh iki aku seneng banget setuju; kanggo saliyane tresno aku saiki felt kanggo Queequeg, iku harpooneer experienced, lan kaya mangkono, ora bisa gagal kanggo dadi gedhe migunani kanggo siji, kang, kaya kula, wutuh bodho saka misteri paus, sanadyan uga kenal karo segara, kaya sing dikenal para pelaut pedagang.
    </p>
    <p>
       Cariyosipun dipunpungkasi kanthi puff ingkang pungkasan ing pipa, Queequeg ngrangkul kula, nyepeng bathuk kula, lan ndamu cahya, kita gulung saka siji liyane, iki lan iki, lan enggal padha turu.

    <p>
       Esuke, Senin, sawise mbuwang sirah embalmed menyang tukang cukur, kanggo blok, aku netepake tagihan dhewe lan kanca; nggunakake, Nanging, dhuwit kancaku. Tuan tanah sing mringis, uga para penghuni asrama, katon nggumunake amarga kekancan sing tiba-tiba muncul ing antarane aku lan Queequeg-utamane amarga crita-crita pitik jago lan sapi Peter Coffin babagan dheweke sadurunge aku kaget banget babagan wong sing saiki dakkancani. karo.
    </p>
    <p>
       We nyilih wheelbarrow a, lan embarking kita iku, kalebu dhewe miskin karpet-tas, lan Queequeg kang kanvas karung lan hammock, adoh kita banjur mudhun kanggo &quot;Moss,&quot;Nantucket paket schooner sethitik moored ing wharf. Nalika aku padha mlaku, wong-wong padha mandeng; ora ing Queequeg dadi luwih-amarga dheweke wis biasa ndeleng kanibal kaya dheweke ing lurung-lurung, nanging nalika ndeleng dheweke lan aku babagan syarat rahasia kasebut. Nanging kita ora ngrungokake wong-wong mau, arep ngoper barrow kanthi giliran, lan Queequeg saiki banjur mandheg kanggo nyetel sarung ing barbs harpoon. Aku takon marang dheweke kenapa dheweke nindakake perkara sing angel banget karo dheweke menyang darat, lan apa kabeh kapal paus ora nemokake harpoon dhewe. Kanggo iki, ing inti, dheweke mangsuli, sanajan apa sing dakkandhakake cukup bener, nanging dheweke nduweni rasa tresna marang harpune dhewe, amarga barang kasebut dijamin, uga dicoba ing pirang-pirang pertempuran, lan banget intim karo ati. saka paus. Ing cendhak, kaya akeh reapers lan mowers ing daratan, sing pindhah menyang Meadows petani kang bersenjata karo scythes dhewe-sanadyan ing wicaksana kapekso kanggo furnish wong-malah, Queequeg, kanggo alasan pribadi dhewe, seneng harpoon dhewe.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngalih gerobak saka tanganku menyang tangane, dheweke nyritakake crita lucu babagan gerobak pertama sing tau dideleng. Iku ing Sag Harbour. Sing nduwèni kapal, kaya-kaya wis nyilihake, kanggo ngusung dhadhane sing abot menyang kos-kosan. Ora katon ora ngerti babagan perkara kasebut - sanajan sejatine dheweke pancen kaya ngono, babagan cara sing tepat kanggo ngatur barrow - Queequeg nyelehake dhadha; lashes iku cepet; banjur nggandhol barrow lan munggah ing dermaga. &quot;Yagene,&quot; ujarku, &quot;Queequeg, sampeyan bisa uga wis ngerti luwih saka iku, siji bakal mikir. Apa wong-wong padha ngguyu?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Sawise iki, dheweke ngandhani crita liyane. Wong-wong ing pulo Rokovoko, misale jek, ing slametan manten padha ngungkapake banyu wangi saka klapa enom menyang calabash patri gedhe kaya punchbowl; lan punchbowl iki tansah mbentuk ornamen tengah gedhe ing mat braided ngendi riyaya dianakaké. Saiki ana kapal dagang gedhe sing nate nyentuh ing Rokovoko, lan komandane - saka kabeh akun, wong lanang sing apik banget, paling ora kanggo kapten laut - komandan iki diundang menyang pesta kawinan adhine Queequeg, putri enom sing ayu. saka sepuluh. Inggih; Nalika para tamu mantèn kabèh padha nglumpuk ing pondhok pring, Kapitan iki mlebu, lan kapasrahake jabatan pakurmatan, mapan ing sandhinge, lan ing antarane Imam Agung lan Sang Prabu, rama Queequeg. Rahmat ngandika, - kanggo wong-wong mau padha duwe sih-rahmat uga kita - sanadyan Queequeg ngandhani kula sing beda karo kita, sing ing wektu kuwi katon mudhun kanggo piring kita, padha, ing nalisir, nyalin bebek, mirit munggah menyang Sang Maha Agung. saka kabeh riyaya-Grace, Aku pitutur, kang ngandika, Imam Agung mbukak pesta dening upacara immemorial pulo; yaiku, nyemplungake driji-driji sing disucekake lan disucekake ing mangkuk sadurunge omben-omben sing diberkahi nyebar. Delengen awake dhewe diselehake ing jejere Imam, lan nyathet upacara kasebut, lan nganggep awake dhewe - dadi Kapten kapal - luwih utama tinimbang Raja pulo, utamane ing omahe Sang Prabu - Kapten kanthi tenang banjur ngumbah tangane ing punchbowl. ;-njupuk aku Upaminipun kanggo driji-kaca ageng. &quot;Saiki,&quot; ujare Queequeg, &quot;apa sing sampeyan pikirake saiki? - Apa wong-wong kita ora ngguyu?&quot;

       Ing pungkasan, wacana mbayar, lan bagasi aman, kita ngadeg ing Papan schooner. Ngangkat layar, ngleyang ing kali Acushnet. Ing sisih siji, New Bedford wungu ing teras ing lurung-lurung, wit-witan sing ditutupi es kabeh padhang ing hawa sing adhem lan adhem. Ageng bukit lan gunung casks ing casks padha numpuk marang dheweke wharves, lan sisih dening sisih donya-wandering kapal paus lay bisu lan aman moored ing pungkasan; nalika saka liyane teka swara tukang kayu lan coopers, karo campuran swara saka geni lan forges kanggo nyawiji Jarak, kabeh betokening sing cruises anyar ing wiwitan; sing siji paling perilous lan dawa voyage rampung, mung wiwit kapindho; lan kapindho rampung, mung wiwit katelu, lan ing, ing salawas-lawase lan kanggo aye. Kuwi tanpa wates, ya, ora bisa ditampa saka kabeh upaya kadonyan.

    <p>
       Entuk banyu luwih mbukak, angin bracing waxed seger; Moss cilik mbuwang umpluk cepet saka busur dheweke, minangka colt enom kang snortings. Carane aku snuffed hawa Tartar sing! - carane aku spurned sing turnpike bumi - sing dalan umum kabeh dented karo tandha saka slavish tumit lan hoofs; lan nguripake kula kanggo ngujo magnanimity saka segara kang ora ngidini cathetan.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ing banyu mancur sing padha, Queequeg katon ngombe lan nggulung karo aku. Irunge sing peteng ndhedhet abuh; dheweke nuduhake untune sing diajukake lan nuding. On, ing kita miber; lan offing kita gained, Lumut ngajeni jeblugan; nyilem lan nyilem busur minangka abdi ing ngarsane Sultan. Miring miring, kita miring darted; saben ropeyarn tingling kaya kawat; loro masts dhuwur buckling kaya tebu India ing tornado darat. Dadi kebak pemandangan reeling iki kita, nalika kita ngadeg ing bowsprit plunging, sing kanggo sawetara wektu kita ora sok dong mirsani glance saka penumpang, lubber kaya lubber, sing gumun yen loro fellow djalmo kudu dadi kanca; kaya-kaya wong kulit putih iku luwih mulya tinimbang wong negro sing wis putih. Nanging ana sawetara boobies lan bumpkins ing kono, sing, kanthi ijo sing kuat, mesthine asale saka jantung lan tengah kabeh verdure. Queequeg kejiret salah siji saka saplings enom niru dheweke konco. Aku panginten jam bumpkin kang kiamat wis teka. Nyelehake harpoon, brawny savage kejiret ing tangan, lan dening dexterity meh miraculous lan kekuatan, dikirim wong dhuwur munggah awak menyang udhara; banjur rada nutul buritan ing mid-someset, fellow ndharat karo paru-paru bursting ing sikilé, nalika Queequeg, nguripake bali marang dheweke, murup pipo tomahawk lan liwati kanggo kula kanggo puff.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Capting! Capting!” bengok-bengok bumpkin, mlayu nyedhaki petugas kasebut; &quot;Capting, Capting, kene setan.&quot;

    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Apa dheweke ngomong?&quot; ngandika Queequeg, minangka kang mildly nguripake kanggo kula.

    <p>
       &quot;Dheweke ujar,&quot; ujare aku, &quot;sampeyan wis cedhak mateni wong sing ana ing kana,&quot; nudingi greenhorn sing isih nggegirisi.

       &quot;Kill-e,&quot; sesambat Queequeg, ngowahi raine sing duwe tato dadi ekspresi sing ora sopan, &quot;ah! dheweke bevy cilik-e iwak-e; Queequeg ora matèni-e dadi cilik-e iwak-e; Queequeg mateni paus gedhe!”
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Deleng sampeyan,&quot; grumbulan Kapten, &quot;Aku bakal mateni 
      <i>
        sampeyan

       , sampeyan kanibal, yen sampeyan nyoba maneh trik sampeyan ing kapal kene; dadi ati-ati mripatmu.”

       Nanging kedaden ing wektu iku, sing wis wektune Kapitan kanggo ngelingi mripate dhewe. Galur sing nggumunake ing layar utama wis misahake lembaran cuaca, lan boom sing luar biasa saiki mabur saka sisih menyang sisih, nyapu kabeh bagian dek. Wong miskin sing wis ditangani Queequeg kanthi kasar, kesapu ing segara; kabeh tangan padha gupuh; lan kanggo nyoba ngrebut boom kanggo tetep iku, ketoke Madness. Iku miber saka tengen ngiwa, lan bali maneh, meh ing siji ticking saka watch, lan saben cepet ketoke ing titik snapping menyang splinters. Ora ana sing ditindakake, lan ora ana sing bisa ditindakake; wong-wong sing ana ing dek kesusu nyedhaki busur, lan ngadeg ndeleng boom kaya rahang ngisor paus sing jengkel. Wonten ing satengahing kabingahan punika, Queequeg mandhap kanthi lincah ing dhengkul, lan nyusup ing sangisore dalan boom, nyepeng tali, nyepetake siji ujung menyang benteng, lan banjur nyemplungake liyane kaya laso, kejiret ing boom. minangka kesapu liwat sirahe, lan ing bodho sabanjuré, spar sing cara kepepet, lan kabeh wis aman. Sekunar kacemplungaken ing angin, lan nalika tangan padha ngresiki prau buritan, Queequeg, diudani menyang bangkekan, darted saka sisih karo busur urip dawa kabisat. Sajrone telung menit utawa luwih dheweke katon nglangi kaya asu, mbuwang tangane sing dawa terus ing ngarepe, lan kanthi giliran mbukak pundhake sing gagah liwat busa beku. Aku katon ing fellow grand lan kamulyane, nanging weruh ora ana siji kanggo disimpen. Greenhorn wis mudhun. Shooting awake jejeg saka banyu, Queequeg, saiki njupuk Mirit cepet watara wong, lan seeming kanggo ndeleng mung carane prakara padha, nyilem mudhun lan ilang. Sawetara menit maneh, dheweke wungu maneh, lengen siji isih metu, lan tangan liyane nyeret wujud sing ora ana nyawa. Prau enggal-enggal ngangkat. Bumpkin miskin dibalèkaké. Kabeh tangan milih Queequeg tromp mulya; kapten nyuwun pangapunten. Wiwit jam iku aku clove kanggo Queequeg kaya barnacle; ya, nganti miskin Queequeg njupuk suwene suwene nyilem.
    </p>
    <p>
       Apa ana semaput kaya ngono? Dheweke ora mikir yen dheweke entuk medali saka Masyarakat Humane lan Magnanimous. Dheweke mung njaluk banyu - banyu seger - kanggo ngilangke brine; Sawise rampung, dheweke nganggo sandhangan garing, nylametake pipa, lan nyenderake tembok-tembok, lan kanthi entheng nyawang wong-wong sing ana ing saubengé, kaya-kaya ngomong ing awake dhewe - &quot;Iki jagad bebarengan, bebarengan, ing kabeh meridian. Kita kanibal kudu mbantu wong-wong Kristen iki.

       BAB 14. Nantucket.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Ora ana liyane sing kedadeyan ing wacana sing pantes kasebut; dadi, sawise roto nggoleki, kita aman teka ing Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nantucket! Copot peta lan delengen. Waca apa pojok nyata ing donya sing dikuwasani; carane ngadeg ana, adoh saka dharat, luwih sepi saka mercusuar Eddystone. Delengen - mung bukit, lan sikut wedhi; kabeh pantai, tanpa latar mburi. Ana pasir luwih akeh tinimbang sing bakal digunakake sajrone rong puluh taun minangka pengganti kertas blotting. Sawetara wights gamesome bakal pitutur marang kowe sing padha kudu nandur suket ana, padha ora tuwuh alamiah; sing padha ngimpor Kanada thistle; sing padha kudu ngirim ngluwihi segara kanggo spile kanggo mungkasi bocor ing tong minyak; sing potongan-potongan kayu ing Nantucket digawa babagan kaya bit saka salib bener ing Roma; supaya wong-wong ing kono nanduri toadstools ing ngarep omahe, supaya ing mangsa panas; sing siji agul-agul saka suket ndadekake oasis, telung lading ing lumaku dina prairie; sing padha nganggo sepatu pasir, kaya sepatu salju Laplander; supaya padha ditutup, sabuk, ing saben dalan, dikubengi, diubengi, lan didadekake pulo ing samodra, nganti ing kursi lan mejane, kerang cilik bakal ditemokake, kaya ing mburi penyu. Nanging extravaganzas iki mung nuduhake yen Nantucket ora Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
       Delengen saiki crita tradhisional sing nggumunake babagan carane pulo iki dienggoni dening wong abang. Mangkono dadi legenda. Ing jaman biyen ana manuk garudha nyabrang ing pesisir New England, lan nggawa bayi India ing cakar. Karo nangis banter wong tuwa weruh anake digawa metu saka ngarsane ing banyu amba. Dheweke mutusake kanggo ngetutake arah sing padha. Nuli numpak kano, sawise ngliwati dalan sing mbebayani, dheweke nemokake pulo kasebut, lan ing kono nemokake peti gadhing sing kosong, balunge wong India cilik.
    </p>
    <p>
       Apa maneh, yen wong-wong Nantucketer iki, sing lair ing pantai, kudu pindhah menyang segara kanggo mata pencaharian! Padha pisanan nyekel crabs lan quohogs ing wedhi; thukul wani, padha waded metu karo jala kanggo mackerel; liyane experienced, padha di-push mati ing prau lan dijupuk cod; lan ing pungkasan, ngetokake angkatan laut kapal gedhe ing segara, njelajah donya banyu iki; sijine sabuk incessant saka circumnavigations watara iku; ngintip ing Selat Behring; lan ing kabeh mangsa lan kabeh segara ngumumake perang langgeng karo massa animasi paling kuat sing wis slamet saka banjir; paling monstrous lan paling gunung! Himmalehan kasebut, Mastodon segara uyah, nganggo kekuwatan sing ora sadar, mula panik sing luwih wedi tinimbang serangan sing paling ora wedi lan ala!
    </p>
    <p>
       Lan mangkono duwe Nantucketers wuda iki, iki pertapa segara, nerbitake saka ant-bukit ing segara, overrun lan conquered donya watery kaya Alexanders akeh; parcelling metu antarane wong-wong mau Atlantik, Pasifik, lan Samudra Hindia, minangka telung kakuwasan bajak laut nindakake Polandia. Ayo Amerika nambah Meksiko kanggo Texas, lan tumpukan Kuba marang Kanada; supaya Inggris overswarm kabeh India, lan nyumerepi banner murub saka srengenge; rong pertiga saka globe terraqueous iki yaiku Nantucketer. Amarga segara iku kagungane; kang ndarbeni iku, minangka Kaisar duwe empires; pelaut liyane duwe nanging hak liwat iku. Kapal dagang mung jembatan ekstensi; bersenjata nanging benteng ngambang; malah perompak lan priyayi, sanadyan ngetutake segara minangka wong gedhe ing dalan, nanging padha njarah-rayah kapal liyane, pecahan tanah liyane kaya awake dhewe, tanpa ngupayakake urip saka jero sing ora ana dhasar. Nantucketer, dheweke mung manggon lan kerusuhan ing segara; piyambake, ing basa Kitab Suci, mudhun menyang ing kapal; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. 
      <i>
        There
      </i>
       is his home; 
      <i>
        there
      </i>
       lies his business, which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
