       Nga nkomawo mu Spouter-Inn okuva mu Chapel, nasanga Queequeg eyo yekka ddala; ye nga yava mu Chapel nga omukisa tegunnabaawo ekiseera. Yali atudde ku katebe mu maaso g’omuliro, ng’ebigere bye biri ku kyoto ky’omu sitoovu, era mu mukono gumu yali akutte kumpi mu maaso ge ekifaananyi ekyo ekitono eky’abaddugavu; ng’atunula nnyo mu maaso gaayo, era ng’akambe aka jack kakuba mpola ku nnyindo yaayo, mu kiseera ekyo ng’awuuma mu mutima gwe mu ngeri ye ey’obukaafiiri.
    </p>
    <p>
       Naye olw’okuba kati asaliddwako, n’ateeka ekifaananyi ekyo; era mu bbanga ttono, ng’agenda ku mmeeza, n’akwata ekitabo ekinene awo, n’akiteeka ku kifuba kye n’atandika okubala empapula mu bugenderevu obutayosa; ku buli lupapula olw’amakumi ataano —nga bwe nnali ndowooza —nga nyimirira akaseera katono, nga ntunula nga bwereere okumwetooloola, era nga mpa okwogera eri enfuufu ey’okuwuuma ey’okwewuunya eyali emaze ebbanga eddene. Olwo yandizzeemu okutandika ku myaka ataano egyaddirira; ng’alabika ng’atandika ku nnamba emu buli mulundi, ng’alinga atasobola kubala kusukka makumi ataano, era olw’omuwendo omunene bwe gutyo ogw’amakumi ataano ogwasangibwa wamu, okwewuunya kwe olw’empapula ennyingi kwe kwacamuka.

       N’obwagazi bungi natuula nga mmutunuulira. Wadde nga yali mukambwe, era nga yayonoonebwa mu ngeri ey’ekivve ku ffeesi —waakiri okusinziira ku buwoomi bwange —ffeesi ye naye yalina ekintu mu yo ekyali tekikkiriziganya n’akatono. Tosobola kukweka mwoyo. Mu ttatu ze zonna ezitali za nsi, nnalowooza nti ndabye obubonero bw’omutima omunyangu omwesimbu; era mu maaso ge amanene, amazito, amaddugavu ag’omuliro era nga ga buvumu, waaliwo obubonero bw’omwoyo ogwandigumye sitaani lukumi. Era ng’oggyeeko bino byonna, waaliwo ekintu ekimu ekigulumivu ku Mukaafiiri, n’obutali bwa mpisa bwe kye tebiyinza kulemaza ddala. Yali alabika ng’omusajja atabangako na cringed era nga tafunangako muntu gwe yeewola. Oba era, omutwe gwe nga gumwese, ekyenyi kye kyali kiwanvuye mu buweerero obw’eddembe era obumasamasa, era nga kirabika nga kigazi okusinga bwe kyandibadde, kino sijja kwewaayo kusalawo; naye certain nti yali mutwe gwe yali phrenologically an excellent one. Kiyinza okulabika ng’eky’okusaaga, naye kyanzijukiza omutwe gwa Genero Washington, nga bwe kirabibwa mu bifaananyi bye ebyabadde bimanyiddwa ennyo. Yalina omusenyu gwe gumu omuwanvu ogwa bulijjo ogudda emabega okuva waggulu w’ebibatu, nga nabyo byali bifuluma nnyo, ng’ensozi bbiri empanvu eziriko emiti eminene waggulu. Queequeg yali George Washington eyakulaakulana mu ngeri ey’okulya abantu.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nga bwe ntyo mmusika nnyo, nga kitundu mu kiseera ekyo nga nneefuula atunuulira omuyaga okuva mu casement, teyafaayo ku kubeerawo kwange, teyeetawaanyangako wadde okutunula okumu; naye yalabika ng’amaliridde ddala okubala empapula z’ekitabo ekyo ekyewuunyisa. Okusinziira ku ngeri gye twali tusula ffenna mu ngeri ey’omukwano ekiro ekyayita, n’okusingira ddala okusinziira ku mukono ogw’omukwano gwe nnali nsanze nga gusuuliddwako nga nzuukuse ku makya, nnalowooza nti obutafaayo buno obw’ekyewuunyo ennyo. Naye ensolo enkambwe bitonde bya kitalo; oluusi tomanyi bulungi ngeri ya kuzitwala. Mu kusooka baba basukkiridde okutya; okwekung’aanya kwabwe okw’obukkakkamu okw’obwangu kulabika ng’amagezi ga Socratic. Era nnali nkitegedde nti Queequeg teyakwataganangako n’akatono, oba naye kitono nnyo, n’abavubi abalala abaali mu kiyumba ky’abagenyi. Tewali nkulaakulana yonna gye yakola; yalabika nga talina bwagazi kugaziya nkulungo y’abantu be yali amanyi. Bino byonna byankuba ng’omuntu omu ow’amaanyi; naye, bwe walowooza omulundi ogw’okubiri, waaliwo ekintu kumpi eky’ekika ekya waggulu mu kyo. Wano waaliwo omusajja mayiro nga enkumi abiri okuva awaka, mu kkubo erigenda e Cape Horn, kwe kugamba — nga eno ye yali ekkubo lyokka lye yali asobola okutuukayo — eyasuulibwa mu bantu abatali bamu gy’ali ng’alinga ali mu pulaneti Jupiter; era naye yalabika ng’ali mu mirembe gye gyonna; okukuuma obutebenkevu obusukkiridde; nga mumativu n’omukwano gwe yennyini; bulijjo yenkana ye kennyini. Mazima ddala kino kyali kikwata ku bufirosoofo obulungi; wadde nga awatali kubuusabuusa yali tawulirangako nti waliwo ekintu ng’ekyo. Naye, mpozzi, okubeera abafirosoofo abatuufu, ffe abantu abafa tetulina kumanya nti tuli balamu bwe batyo oba nga tufuba bwe tutyo. Kale amangu ddala nga mpulira nti omusajja ng’oyo oba ng’oyo yeewaayo olw’omufirosoofo, nfundikira nti, okufaananako omukazi omukadde alina obuzibu mu kuzimba, ateekwa okuba nga “yamenya ekyuma kye eky’okugaaya.”

       Nga ntudde awo mu kisenge ekyo kati ekyali kirimu; omuliro nga gwokya wansi, mu mutendera ogwo omugonvu, oluvannyuma lw’amaanyi gaago agasooka okubugumya empewo, olwo ne guyakaayakana kwokka okutunuulirwa; ebisiikirize eby’akawungeezi n’ebifaananyi ebikuŋŋaana okwetooloola ebisenge, era nga bitutunuulira mu ffe ababiri abasirise, abali bokka; omuyaga ogubuuka ebweru mu bizimba eby’ekitiibwa; Nnatandika okutegeera enneewulira ezitali za bulijjo. Nawulira nga waliwo okusaanuuka mu nze. Tewakyaliwo mutima gwange ogwakutuka n’omukono gwange ogwali gufuuse eddalu byakyusibwa ku nsi y’emisege. Ensolo eno ey’obukambwe eyali ekkakkanya yali aginunulidde. Eyo gye yatuula, obutafaayo bwe bwennyini nga kwogera obutonde nga tewaali bunnanfuusi bwa mpisa n’obulimba obutaliimu. Yali nsiko; ekifaananyi kyennyini eky’ebifo eby’okulaba; naye ne ntandika okuwulira nga nsikirizibwa mu ngeri ey’ekyama gy’ali. Era ebintu ebyo bye bimu ebyandigobye abalala abasinga obungi, bye byali magineeti zennyini ezansika bwe zityo. Nja kugezaako mukwano gwange omukaafiiri, bwe nnalowooza, okuva ekisa ky’Ekikristaayo bwe kikakasiddwa naye nga kya mpisa ekituli. Namusemberera entebe yange, ne nkola obubonero obw’omukwano n’obukodyo, nga nkola kyonna ekisoboka okwogera naye mu kiseera ekyo. Mu kusooka teyakiraba nnyo nkulaakulana zino; naye mu kiseera kino, bwe nnayogera ku ngeri gye yasembezaamu abagenyi ekiro ekyakeesezza olwaleero, yakola okumbuuza oba twali tugenda kuddamu okubeera bannaffe. Namugamba nti yee; gye nnalowooza nti yalabika ng’asanyuse, mpozzi ng’asiima katono.

       Oluvannyuma twakyusa ekitabo ekyo nga tuli wamu, era ne nfuba okumunnyonnyola ekigendererwa ky’okukuba ebitabo, n’amakulu g’ebifaananyi ebitono ebyali mu kyo. Bwentyo mu bbanga ttono nnayingizaamu okufaayo kwe; era okuva awo twagenda mu kukuba ebikonde ebisinga obulungi ku bifo eby’enjawulo eby’ebweru ebiyinza okulabibwa mu kibuga kino ekimanyiddwa ennyo. Mu bbanga ttono nnateesa ku mukka gw’embeera z’abantu; era, ng’afulumya ensawo ye ne tomahawk, mu kasirise n’ampa omukka. Era awo ne tutuula nga tuwaanyisiganya ebifuuwa okuva mu payipu eyo ey’omu nsiko ey’eyo, era nga tugikuuma nga bulijjo eyita wakati waffe.

    <p>
       Bwe kiba nti waali wakyaliwo ice yonna ey’obutafaayo gye ndi mu kifuba ky’Omukaafiiri, omukka guno omusanyusa, ogw’obuseegu gwe twalina, mu bbanga ttono gwagusaanuusa, ne gutuleka nga ba mukwano. Yalabika ng’antwala mu butonde era mu ngeri etayitibwa nga nze bwe mmutwala; era omukka gwaffe bwe gwaggwa, n’anyigiriza ekyenyi kye ku kyange, n’ankwata mu kiwato, n’agamba nti okuva kati twafumbiriganwa; ekitegeeza, mu kigambo ky’ensi ye, nti twali mikwano gya kifuba; yandinfiiridde n’essanyu, bwe kiba nga kyetaagisa. Mu muntu wa ggwanga, ennimi z’omuliro zino ez’omukwano ez’amangu zandirabise nga tezinnaba kutuuka, ekintu ekitayinza kwesiga nnyo; naye mu savage eno ennyangu amateeka ago amakadde tegandikoze.

       Oluvannyuma lw’okulya ekyeggulo, n’okukubaganya ebirowoozo okulala n’okunywa sigala, twagenda ffenna mu kisenge kyaffe. Yanfuula ekirabo ky’omutwe gwe ogwali gusiigiddwa eddagala; yaggyayo waleti ye ennene ennyo eya taaba, n’akwata wansi wa taaba, n’aggyayo ddoola nga amakumi asatu mu ffeeza; olwo n’azisaasaanya ku mmeeza, n’azigabanyaamu mu makanika mu bitundu bibiri ebyenkanankana, n’asika ekimu ku byo gye ndi, n’agamba nti kyange. Nnali hhenda kwekalakaasa; naye n’ansirisa ng’aziyiwa mu nsawo z’empale zange. Nabaleka ne basigala. Oluvannyuma yagenda mu kusaba kwe okw’olweggulo, n’aggyayo ekifaananyi kye, n’aggyayo ekipande ky’omuliro eky’empapula. Olw’obubonero n’obubonero obumu, nnalowooza nti yali alabika nga mweraliikirivu okumwegattako; naye olw’okuba mmanyi bulungi ekyali kigenda okuddirira, nnateesa akaseera katono oba singa ansaba, nnandigoberedde oba ekirala.

       Nnali Mukristaayo mulungi; yazaalibwa era n’azaalibwa mu kifuba ky’Ekkanisa ya Presbyterian etaliiko nsobi. Kati olwo nnandibadde ntya okwegatta n’omusinza ebifaananyi ono ow’omu nsiko mu kusinza ekitundu kye eky’omuti? Naye okusinza kye ki? nalowooza nze.Olowooza kati, Isimayiri, nti Katonda ow’amaanyi ow’eggulu n’ensi — abakaafiiri ne bonna nga mw’otwalidde —ayinza okukwatirwa obuggya akatono akatono ak’omuti omuddugavu? Tekisoboka! Naye okusinza kye ki? —okukola Katonda by’ayagala — 
      <i>

       kwe kusinza. Era Katonda by’ayagala kye ki?—okukola omuntu munnange kye nandyagadde omuntu munnange ankolere — 
      <i>
        ekyo
      </i>
       Katonda ky’ayagala. Kati, Queequeg ye musajja munnange. Era kiki kye njagala Queequeg ono yandinkoledde? Lwaki, wegatte nange mu ngeri yange ey’okusinza ey’Abapresbyterian entongole. N’olwekyo, olwo nnina okwegatta naye mu bibye; ergo, nnina okufuuka omusinza ebifaananyi. Bwentyo ne nkoma omuliro mu bikuta; yayamba okuwanirira ekifaananyi ekitono ekitaliiko musango; yamuwadde bisikiiti eyokeddwa ne Queequeg; salamed mu maaso ge emirundi ebiri oba esatu; yanywegera ennyindo ye; era ekyo bwe kyakolebwa, twayambula ne twebaka, mu mirembe n’omuntu waffe ow’omunda n’ensi yonna. Naye tetwagenda kwebaka nga tetulina kaboozi katono.
    </p>
    <p>
       Bwe kiri simanyi; naye tewali kifo ng’ekitanda eky’okulaga ebyama wakati w’emikwano. Omusajja n’omukyala, bagamba nti, eyo gye baggulawo wansi ennyo w’emyoyo gyabwe eri munne; era abafumbo abamu abakadde batera okulimba ne banyumya ku biseera eby’edda okutuusa kumpi ku makya. Bwe kityo, n’olwekyo, mu lugendo lw’emitima gyaffe olw’omubisi gw’enjuki, nze ne Queequeg twagalamira —ababiri abalungi era abaagalana.

Kitaawe yali Mulangira Waggulu, Kabaka; kojja we Kabona Asinga Obukulu; ate ku ludda lwa maama yeewaanira ku bassenga abaali bakyala b’abalwanyi abatawangulwa.

       Emmeeri ya Sag Harbor yakyalira ekifo kya kitaawe, era Queequeg n’anoonya ekkubo erigenda mu nsi z’Abakristaayo. Naye emmeeri, olw’okuba n’abavubi abajjuvu, n’enyooma essuuti ye; era si obuyinza bwa Kabaka bwonna obwa kitaawe bwe bwali busobola okuwangula. Wabula Queequeg yaweze ekirayiro.

       Era bwe kityo omusinza ebifaananyi omukadde ku mutima, naye yali abeera mu Bakristaayo bano, n’ayambala engoye zaabwe, era n’agezaako okwogera ebigambo byabwe eby’obuseegu. Hence the queer ways about him, wadde nga kati waliwo akaseera okuva awaka.
    </p>
    <p>
       By hints, namubuuza oba teyateesa kuddayo, n’okutuuzibwa ku ntebe; okuva bwe kiri nti kati ayinza okutwala kitaawe ng’afudde era ng’agenze, ng’akaddiye nnyo era munafu mu biwandiiko ebisembayo. Yaddamu nti nedda, tannaba; era n’agattako nti yali atya Obukristaayo, oba okusingawo Abakristaayo, bwe bwali tebumusaanira olw’okulinnya ku ntebe ennongoofu era etali nnono ya Bakabaka amakumi asatu abakaafiiri abaamusooka. Naye mpozzi, yagamba nti, ajja kuddayo, —amangu ddala nga yeewulira ng’azzeemu okubatizibwa. Kyokka ku ba nonce, yateesa okusaabala amaato, n’okusiga oats ze ez’omu nsiko mu nnyanja zonna ennya. Baali bamufudde omuggo, era ekyuma ekyo eky’emiguwa kyali mu kifo ky’omuggo kati.
    </p>
    <p>
       Namubuuza kiki ekiyinza okuba ekigendererwa kye eky’amangu, nga nkwata ku ntambula ze ez’omu maaso. Yaddamu, okuddamu okugenda ku nnyanja, mu mulimu gwe ogw’edda. Ku kino, namugamba nti okuvuba ennyanja ekika kya whale yali nteekateeka yange, era ne mmutegeeza ku kigendererwa kyange eky’okusaabala okuva e Nantucket, nga gwe mwalo ogusinga okusuubiza omuvuzi w’ennyanja ekika kya whale omuyiiya w’ayinza okulinnya. Amangu ago yasalawo okunwerekera ku kizinga ekyo, okulinnya emmeeri ku mmeeri y’emu, okuyingira mu ssaawa y’emu, eryato lye limu, okutabula kwe kumu nange, mu bufunze okugabana buli hap yange; nga emikono gyange gyombi giri mu ye, n’obuvumu nnyiga mu Potluck y’ensi zombi. Bino byonna nnabikkiriza n’essanyu; kubanga ng’oggyeeko omukwano gwe nnali mpulira kati eri Queequeg, yali muvuzi wa harpoone alina obumanyirivu, era nga bw’ali, yali tayinza kulemererwa kuba wa mugaso munene eri omuntu, nga nze, nga nze, yali tamanyidde ddala byama bya kuvuba ennyanja ekika kya whale, wadde nga yali amanyi bulungi ennyanja, nga bwe kimanyiddwa abalunnyanja abasuubuzi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Emboozi ye ng’ekoma n’okufuuwa kwa payipu ye okusembayo okufa, Queequeg yannywegera, n’anyigiriza ekyenyi kye ku kyange, era ng’afuuwa ekitangaala, twayiringisibwa okuva ku munne, eno n’eri, era mu bbanga ttono nnyo twali twebaka.

       ESSUULA 13. Akagaali.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Enkeera ku makya, ku Mmande, oluvannyuma lw’okusuula omutwe ogwali gusiigiddwa eddagala eri omusawo w’enviiri, okumala bulooka, nnasasula ssente zange ne munnange; wabula nga nkozesa ssente za munnange. Landiroodi eyali amwenya, awamu n’aba boarder, baali balabika nga bawunyiriza mu ngeri eyeewuunyisa olw’omukwano ogw’amangu ogwali guvuddeyo wakati wange ne Queequeg —naddala ng’emboozi za Peter Coffin ez’omukira n’ente ennume ezimukwatako emabegako zaali zinneeraliikiriza nnyo ku muntu yennyini kati gwe nnali nkolagana naye ne.
    </p>
    <p>
       Twewola akagaali, era nga tulinnya ebintu byaffe, nga mw’otwalidde n’ensawo yange eya kapeti embi, n’ensawo ya Queequeg eya kanvaasi ne hammock, wala twakka ku “the Moss,” akatono aka Nantucket packet schooner akaasimbiddwa ku mwalo. Nga tugenda abantu ne batunula butunuzi; si ku Queequeg nnyo —kubanga baali bamanyidde okulaba abantu abalya abantu nga ye mu nguudo zaabwe, —wabula okumulaba nze nange ku bukwakkulizo obw’ekyama bwe butyo. Naye tetwaziwuliriza, nga tugenda nga tuvuga akagaali nga tukyuka, era Queequeg kati n’oluvannyuma ng’ayimirira okutereeza ekikuta ku biwujjo bye eby’engoye. Namubuuza lwaki yasitula ekintu ekizibu bwe kiti ku lukalu, era oba emmeeri zonna ezivuba ennyanja ekika kya whale tezaafunanga biwujjo byazo. Ku kino, mu makulu, yaddamu, nti newankubadde nga bye nnalambika byali bituufu ekimala, naye yalina omukwano ogw’enjawulo eri ekyuma kye, kubanga kyali kya bintu ebikakasibwa, nga kigezeseddwa bulungi mu lutalo lungi olw’okufa, era nga luli mu mukwano ogw’amaanyi n’emitima wa nnyanja ekika kya whale. Mu bufunze, okufaananako n’abakungula bangi ab’omunda mu nsi n’abasala, abagenda mu ddundiro ly’abalimi nga bakutte ebisero byabwe —wadde nga mu ngeri yonna tebalina kukakasibwa kubiwa bintu —wadde bwe kyali bwe kityo, Queequeg, olw’ensonga ze ez’ekyama, yayagala nnyo ekyuma kye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ng’akyusa eggaali okuva ku mukono gwange n’agitwala ku ye, yantegeeza emboozi esesa ku kagaali ke yasooka okulaba. Yali mu mwalo gw’e Sag. Bannannyini mmeeri ye, kirabika baali bamuwoze emu, mw’ayinza okusitula ekifuba kye ekizito okutuuka mu nnyumba ye ey’okusulamu. Obutalabika nga tamanyi kintu ekyo —wadde nga mu mazima yali bw’atyo ddala, ku bikwata ku ngeri entuufu ey’okuddukanyaamu eggaali —Queequeg agiteekako ekifuba kye; agikuba emiggo amangu; n’oluvannyuma n’akwata akagaali n’atambula n’alinnya ku mwalo. “Lwaki,” bwe nnagamba, “Queequeg, oyinza okuba nga wali omanyi okusinga ekyo, omuntu yandirowoozezza. Abantu tebaaseka?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Ku kino, yantegeeza emboozi endala. Abantu b’oku kizinga kye ekya Rokovoko, kirabika ku mbaga zaabwe ez’embaga bafulumya amazzi agawunya akawoowo aga muwogo omuto mu kalaba omunene oguliko amabala ng’ebbakuli y’ekikonde; era punchbowl eno bulijjo ekola eky’okwewunda ekinene eky’omu makkati ku kitanda ekilukibwa ekijjulo we kibeera. Kati emmeeri emu ey’abasuubuzi ennene lumu yakwata ku Rokovoko, era omuduumizi waayo — okusinziira ku biwandiiko byonna, omwami ow’ekitiibwa ennyo ow’obudde, waakiri ku kapiteeni w’ennyanja —omuduumizi ono yayitibwa ku mbaga ya mwannyina wa Queequeg, omumbejja omuto omulungi eyaakakyuka okutera. Bulungi; abagenyi bonna ab’embaga bwe baakuŋŋaanidde mu kiyumba ky’omugole eky’emiwemba, Kapiteeni ono atambula n’ayingira, era bwe yaweebwa ekifo eky’ekitiibwa, ne yeeteeka waggulu ku bbakuli y’ekikonde, era wakati wa Kabona Omukulu n’omukulu we Kabaka, kitaawe wa Queequeg. Ekisa nga kyogerwa, —kubanga abantu abo balina ekisa kyabwe nga ffe —wadde nga Queequeg yang’amba nti obutafaananako ffe, mu biseera ng’ebyo abatunuulira wansi ku ssowaani zaffe, bo, okwawukana ku ekyo, nga bakoppa engege, batunula waggulu eri Omugabi omukulu ku mbaga zonna — Ekisa, ngamba, nga kigambibwa, Kabona Asinga Obukulu aggulawo ekijjulo n’omukolo ogutajjukirwa ogw’ekizinga; kwe kugamba, okunnyika engalo ze ezaatukuzibwa era ezitukuziddwa mu bbakuli ng’ekyokunywa eky’omukisa tekinnatambula. Ng’alaba ng’ateekeddwa okumpi ne Kabona, n’okwetegereza omukolo, n’okwerowooza — okuba Kapiteeni w’emmeeri — ng’alina okukulembera mu ngeri ey’olwatu ku Kabaka ow’ekizinga yekka, naddala mu nnyumba ya Kabaka yennyini — Kapiteeni mu bunnyogovu agenda mu maaso n’okunaaba emikono mu bbakuli y’ekikonde ;—okukitwala ndowooza ku finger-glass ennene ennyo. Queequeg yagamba nti: “Kati, kiki ky’olowoozaako kati?—Abantu baffe tebaaseka?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Oluvannyuma, nga tusasulwa okuyita, era nga tetulina migugu, twayimirira ku mmeeri ya schooner. Ng’esitula emmeeri, yaseeyeeya wansi mu mugga Acushnet. Ku ludda olumu, New Bedford yasituka mu ttereeza z’enguudo, ng’emiti gyabwe egyali gibikkiddwako bbalaafu gyonna gyakaayakana mu mpewo ennyogovu era ennyogovu. Obusozi obunene ennyo n’ensozi z’ebidomola ku bidomola byali bitumbiddwa ku mwalo gwe, era emmeeri z’ennyanja ekika kya whale ezaali zitaayaaya mu nsi yonna zaali zisirise era nga zisimbiddwa bulungi ku nkomerero; ate okuva mu balala ne wava eddoboozi ly’ababazzi n’abafumbi, nga lirimu amaloboozi ag’omuliro n’ebifo ebitabuddwamu okusaanuusa ekisaawe, byonna nga biraga nti emmeeri empya zaali zitandise; nti olugendo olumu olusinga okuba olw’akabi era oluwanvu lwaggwa, lutandika lumu lwokka; era eyookubiri ekoma, etandika eyookusatu yokka, n’ebirala, emirembe gyonna era emirembe gyonna. Bw’atyo bwe buli obutakoma, weewaawo, obutagumiikiriza kw’okufuba kwonna okw’oku nsi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Olw’okufuna amazzi agaggule ennyo, empewo eyali enyweza n’efuuka empya; aka Moss akatono kaasuula ekifuba eky’amangu okuva ku butaasa bwe, ng’omwana gw’endogoyi omuto bwe gufuuwa. Nga nnafuuwa empewo eyo ey’Abatartar! —nga bwe nnanyooma ensi eyo ey’okukyuka! —oluguudo olwo olukulu olwa bulijjo wonna nga lujjudde obubonero bw’ebisinziiro n’ebigere eby’obuddu; era n’ankyusa okwegomba obunene bw’ennyanja obutajja kukkiriza biwandiiko byonna.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ku nsulo y’emu ey’ekifuba, Queequeg yalabika ng’anywa n’okuwuubaala nange. Ennyindo ze ezaali ziddugavu zazimba ne zikutuka; yalaze amannyo ge agaali ga fayiro era agasongovu. Ku, ku twabuuka; era offing yaffe ne efuna, Moss yakola ekitiibwa eri okubwatuka; yadduka n’adduka obutaasa bwe ng’omuddu mu maaso ga Sultan. Nga twesigamye ku mabbali, twadduka ku mabbali; buli luwuzi lw’emiguwa oluwunya nga waya; ebikondo ebiwanvu ebibiri nga biwuuma ng’emiggo gy’Abayindi mu kibuyaga ow’oku lukalu. Ffe twali tujjudde nnyo ekifo kino ekyali kiwuguka, nga tuyimiridde ku mabbali g’omusulo gw’obutaasa ogwali gunywera, ne kiba nti okumala ekiseera tetwalaba kutunula kwa kusekererwa kw’abasaabaze, ekibiina ekiringa ekizigo, abeewuunya nti bannaffe babiri baalina okuba nga bakolagana nnyo; nga omuzungu bw’ali ekintu kyonna eky’ekitiibwa okusinga omuddugavu eyeeru. Naye waaliwo boobies ne bumpkins ezimu eyo, nga, olw’obuddugavu bwazo obw’amaanyi, ziteekwa okuba nga zaava mu mutima ne wakati mu verdure yonna. Queequeg yakutte ekimu ku bimera bino ebito nga bimukoppa emabega w’omugongo gwe. Nalowooza nti essaawa ya bumpkin ey’okuzikirizibwa etuuse. Nga asuula ekyuma kye, omusajja omukambwe ow’amaanyi n’amukwata mu ngalo ze, era olw’obukodyo n’amaanyi kumpi eby’ekyamagero, n’amusindika waggulu mu mubiri mu bbanga; olwo ng’akuba katono ku mugongo gwe mu makkati g’okugwa, munne n’agwa wansi ng’amawuggwe gakutuse ku bigere bye, ate Queequeg ng’amukyusizza omugongo, n’akoleeza payipu ye eya tomahawk n’agiyisa gye ndi okufuuwa.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Okukwata ebifaananyi! Okukwata ebifaananyi!” yaleekaana ekibumbe, ng’adduka ng’ayolekera omuserikale oyo; “Capting, Capting, wuuno sitaani.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hallo, 
      <i>
        ggwe
      </i>
       ssebo,” Kapiteeni bwe yakaaba, olubavu lw’ennyanja olugonvu, ng’agoberera okutuuka e Queequeg, “kiki mu kubwatuka kw’otegeeza mu ekyo? Tomanyi nti oyinza okuba nga watta chap oyo?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ky’ayogera?” Queequeg bwe yagamba, ng’ankyukira mu ngeri ey’obukkakkamu.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Agamba,” bwe nnagamba, “nti wasemberera kill-e omusajja oyo eyo,” ng’asonga ku greenhorn eyali ekyakankana.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Kill-e,” Queequeg bwe yakaaba ng’akyusakyusa ffeesi ye eyabaddeko ttatu mu ngeri etali ya nsi ey’okunyooma, “ah! ye bevy obutono-e ebyennyanja-e; Queequeg no kill-e bwekityo obutono-e ebyennyanja-e; Queequeg kill-e ennyanja ennene!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Laba ggwe,” Kapiteeni bwe yawuluguma, “Nja kukutta-e , 
      <i>
        ggwe
      </i>
       omulya abantu, bw’onoogezaako obukodyo bwo obulala ku lyato wano; n’olwekyo lowooza ku liiso lyo.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Naye kyaliwo mu kiseera ekyo kyennyini, ne kiba nti ekiseera kyatuuka Kapiteeni okulowooza ku liiso lye. Okunyigirizibwa okw’ekitalo okwali ku mmeeri enkulu kwali kwawuddemu ekipande ky’obudde, era kati eddoboozi ery’amaanyi ennyo lyali libuuka okuva ku ludda olumu okudda ku lulala, nga lisenya ddala ekitundu kyonna ekya ddeeke. Omwavu Queequeg gwe yali akutte mu ngeri ey’obukambwe ennyo, yakulukutira mu nnyanja; emikono gyonna gyali mu kusattira; era okugezaako okunyaga ku boom okugisigala, kyalabika ng’eddalu. Yabuuka okuva ku ddyo okudda ku kkono, n’edda emabega, kumpi mu kukuba essaawa emu, era buli kaseera kaali kalabika ng’egenda okukutuka mu bitundutundu. Tewali kyakolebwa, era tewali kyalabika ng’ekiyinza okukolebwa; abaali ku ddeeke baafubutuka nga boolekera obutaasa, ne bayimirira nga batunuulira eboozi nga balinga akawanga aka wansi ak’ennyanja ekika kya whale eyali enyiize. Wakati mu kwewuunya kuno, Queequeg yagwa mu ngeri ey’obukugu okutuuka ku maviivi ge, era ng’aseerera wansi w’ekkubo ly’ekibookisi, n’akuba omuguwa, n’anyweza enkomerero emu ku bigo, n’oluvannyuma n’asuula endala ng’ekiso, n’agikwata okwetooloola bbomu nga bwe kimwekulukuunya ku mutwe, era ku kusika omuguwa okwaddako, spar yali ekwatiddwa bwetyo, era byonna nga tebirina bulabe. Schooner yaddukira mu mpewo, era emikono bwe gyali gigogola eryato eryali emabega, Queequeg, eyali yeeyambula okutuuka mu kiwato, n’adduka okuva ku mabbali n’akapiira akawangaala akawanvu ak’okubuuka. Okumala eddakiika ssatu oba okusingawo yalabibwa ng’awuga ng’embwa, ng’asuula emikono gye emiwanvu butereevu mu maaso ge, era ng’akyusakyusa n’alaga ebibegabega bye ebinywevu ng’ayita mu kifuba ekyali kifuuse omuzira. Natunuulira munnange omukulu era ow’ekitiibwa, naye nga tewali muntu yenna ajja kulokolebwa. Greenhorn yali egenze wansi. Nga yeekuba amasasi nga yeesimbye okuva mu mazzi, Queequeg, kati yatunula mu kaseera katono okumwetooloola, era ng’alinga alaba engeri ensonga gye zaali, n’abbira wansi n’abulawo. Eddakiika endala ntono, n’asituka nate, omukono ogumu nga gukyakuba, ate omulala nga gusika ffoomu etaliimu bulamu. Mu bbanga ttono eryato lyabasitula. Bumpkin embi yakomezeddwawo. Emikono gyonna gyalonda Queequeg nga ekkondeere ery’ekitiibwa; kapiteeni yamwegayirira okusonyiyibwa. Okuva ku ssaawa eyo ne ngenda e Queequeg nga barnacle; yee, okutuusa Queequeg omwavu lwe yakwata dive ye empanvu esembayo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Waaliwo lwe waaliwo obutategeera ng’obwo? Yalabika nga talowooza nti yali agwanidde n’akatono omudaali okuva mu kibiina kya Humane and Magnanimous Societies. Yasaba mazzi gokka —amazzi amayonjo —ekintu eky’okusiimuula omunnyo; ekyo bwe kyakola, yayambala engoye enkalu, n’akoleeza payipu ye, era n’amwesigamira ku bigo, era n’atunuulira mu ngeri ey’obukkakkamu abo abaali bamwetoolodde, yalabika ng’agamba mu mutima gwe nti —“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. Ffe abalya abantu tulina okuyamba Abakristaayo bano.”

       ESSUULA 14. Nantucket.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Tewali kintu kirala kyaliwo ku kitundu ekisaanira okwogerwako; bwe kityo, oluvannyuma lw’okudduka obulungi, twatuuka bulungi e Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nantucket nga! Ggyayo maapu yo ogitunuulire. Laba enkoona entuufu ey’ensi gy’ekwata; engeri gye kiyimiridde awo, ewala okuva ku lubalama lw’ennyanja, nga kiri kyokka okusinga ettaala ya Eddystone. Kitunuulire —olusozi lwokka, n’enkokola y’omusenyu; byonna ku bbiici, nga tebirina mugongo. Waliwo omusenyu mungi eyo okusinga gwe wandikozesezza mu myaka amakumi abiri ng’ekifo ky’empapula ezisiimuula. Abamu ku gamesome wights bajja kukugamba nti balina okusimbayo omuddo, tegukula mu butonde; nti bayingiza ebiwuka ebiyitibwa Canada thistles; nti balina okusindika emitala w’ennyanja okugenda okuyiwa okuziyiza okukulukuta mu kibbo ky’amafuta; nti ebitundu by’enku mu Nantucket bitambuzibwa ng’ebitundutundu by’omusaalaba ogw’amazima mu Rooma; nti abantu abali eyo basimba omusulo gw’enkwale mu maaso g’ennyumba zaabwe, okusobola okuyingira wansi w’ekisiikirize mu biseera by’obutiti; nti ekiso ekimu eky’omuddo kifuula oasis, ebiso bisatu mu kutambula olunaku lumu ddundiro; nti bambala engatto z’omusenyu omulamu, ekintu ekiringa engatto z’omuzira eza Laplander; nti zisiriddwa nnyo, zisibiddwa emisipi, buli ngeri nga zizingibwa, zeetooloddwa, era ne zifuulibwa ekizinga ekijjuvu eky’oku mabbali g’ennyanja, ne kiba nti ku ntebe zazo zennyini n’emmeeza enseenene entonotono oluusi zijja kusangibwa nga zinyweredde, nga ku migongo gy’enkwale z’omu nnyanja. Naye bino ebivvulu biraga nti Nantucket si Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
       Laba kati emboozi ey’ennono eyeewuunyisa ku ngeri ekizinga kino gye kyasengamu abasajja abamyufu. Bw’atyo enfumo bw’egenda. Mu biseera eby’edda empungu yagwa wansi ku lubalama lw’ennyanja New England, n’etwala Omuyindi omuwere mu bigere bye. Nga bakuba ebiwoobe eby’amaanyi abazadde baalaba omwana waabwe ng’asituddwa nga talabika ku mazzi amagazi. Baasalawo okugoberera mu kkubo lye limu. Nga basitula mu maato gaabwe, oluvannyuma lw’okuyita mu ngeri ey’akabi baazuula ekizinga ekyo, era eyo gye baasangayo essanduuko ey’amasanga etaliimu kintu kyonna, —amagumba g’Omuyindi omuto omwavu.
    </p>
    <p>
       N’olwekyo, kyewuunyisa nnyo nti bano aba Nantucket, abazaalibwa ku bbiici, balina okugenda ku nnyanja okweyimirizaawo! Baasooka kukwata enseenene ne quohogs mu musenyu; bwe beeyongera obuvumu, ne bakulukuta n’obutimba okunoonya enseenene; bwe baali basinga okuba n’obumanyirivu, baasikambulanga mu maato ne bakwata enseenene eziyitibwa cod; era ku nkomerero, ng’asindika eggye ly’amazzi ery’emmeeri ennene ku nnyanja, n’anoonyereza ku nsi eno ey’amazzi; teeka omusipi ogutasalako ogw’okwetooloola okugyetooloola; yatunula mu kifo ekiyitibwa Behring’s Straits; era mu sizoni zonna ne mu nnyanja zonna zalangirira olutalo olutaggwaawo n’ekibinja ekisinga amaanyi eky’obulamu ekiwonye amataba; ebisinga okubeera eby’ekitalo era ebisinga okuba eby’ensozi! Oyo Himmalehan, Mastodon ow’ennyanja y’omunnyo, ayambadde obubonero obw’amaanyi obutategeera, nti okutya kwe kwennyini kwe kutiisibwatiisibwa okusinga okulumba kwe okusinga obutatya n’obubi!
    </p>
    <p>
       Era bwe batyo aba Nantucket bano abali obwereere, abaweereza bano ab’omu nnyanja, nga bafuluma okuva ku lusozi lwabwe olw’enseenene mu nnyanja, bafubutuse ne bawangula ensi ey’amazzi ng’Abalekzanda bangi bwe batyo; nga bagabanyamu ennyanja Atlantic, Pacific, ne Buyindi mu zo, ng’amawanga asatu ag’ababbi b’oku nnyanja bwe baakola Poland. Leka Amerika eyongere Mexico ku Texas, era etuume Cuba ku Canada; Abangereza bakwate Buyindi yonna, era bawanise bendera yaabwe eyakaayakana okuva ku musana; ebitundu bibiri ku bisatu ebya globe eno ey’amayinja (terraqueous globe) bya Nantucketer. Kubanga ennyanja ye ye; ye nnannyini yo, nga Empula bwe balina obwakabaka; abavubi abalala nga balina kyokka eddembe ly’okuyita mu kyo. Emmeeri z’abasuubuzi zibeera bibanda bya kugaziya; abalina emmundu naye nga bigo ebitengejja; n’ababbi b’oku nnyanja n’ab’obwannannyini, wadde nga bagoberera ennyanja ng’abavuzi b’enguudo ennene ekkubo, wabula banyaga emmeeri endala, ebitundutundu ebirala eby’ettaka nga bo, nga tebafuba kuggya bulamu bwabwe mu buziba obutali wansi bwennyini. Omu Nantucketer, ye yekka abeera era akola effujjo ku nnyanja; ye yekka, mu lulimi lwa Baibuli, agenda ku kyo mu mmeeri; okugenda n’okudda ng’agilima ng’ennimiro ye ey’enjawulo.

       lies his business, which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>

       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
