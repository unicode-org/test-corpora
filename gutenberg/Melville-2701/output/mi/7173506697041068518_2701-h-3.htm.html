       UPOKO 10. He Hoa Uea.
    </h2>
    <p>
       I taku hokinga atu ki te Spouter-Inn mai i te Whare Karakia, ka kitea e ahau ko Queequeg anake i reira; kua wehe atu ia i te Whare Karakia i mua i te karakia mo etahi wa. E noho ana ia i runga i te tauera i mua i te ahi, ko ona waewae i runga i te kaa ahi, ko tetahi ringa e mau ana ki tona mata i tana whakapakoko negro iti; ka titiro marie ki tona mata, me te maripi hake ka tukitukia ana tona ihu, i tenei wa e hummingi ana ki a ia ano i runga i tana tikanga whakakeke.
    </p>
    <p>
       Otira ka mutu tana whakatuturu i te whakapakoko; kare i roa, ka haere ki te tepu, ka mau i tetahi pukapuka nui ki reira, ka tuu ki runga i tona uma ka timata te tatau i nga wharangi ma te whakaaro tika; i ia rima tekau nga wharangi—ka rite ki taku i whakaaro ai—ka tu i te wa poto, ka titiro mahorahora ki a ia, ka tuku korero ki te whio o te miharo. Ka timata ano ia i te rima tekau i muri mai; me te mea ka timata i te nama kotahi i ia wa, me te mea e kore e taea e ia te tatau neke atu i te rima tekau, a na te tokomaha noa o nga rima tekau i kitea tahitia, i oho ai tona miharo ki te tini o nga wharangi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ma te nui o te hiahia i noho ahau ki te matakitaki ia ia. Ahakoa he mohoao ia, he kino te ahua o te kanohi — ahakoa ki taku reka — he ahua ano kei roto i tona ahua e kore rawa e whakararu. Kaore e taea e koe te huna i te wairua. I roto i ana mahi moko kore whenua, i whakaaro ahau i kite ahau i nga tohu o te ngakau pono; a, i roto i ona kanohi nui, hohonu, he pango mura me te maia, ko te ahua o nga tohu o te wairua e maia ana ki te kotahi mano nga rewera. I tua atu i enei mea katoa, tera ano tetahi pikaunga teitei o te Pagana, kihai hoki i taea e tona poka ke te tino whakaititia. He rite ia ki te tangata kare ano i ngenge, kare ano he tangata nama. Ahakoa kua heua tona mahunga, kua unuhia tona rae i roto i te maramatanga ake, me te titiro whanui atu i era atu, e kore ahau e kaha ki te whakatau; engari ko tana mahunga he tino pai. He ahua tawa noa, engari i maumahara ahau ki te upoko o Tianara Washington, i kitea i roto i nga pupuhi rongonui a ia. He rite tonu te ahua o te pikinga whakamuri i ia wa mai i runga ake o nga rae, he ahua tino matakite, he rite ki te rua o nga taunga roa e mau ana te rakau ki runga. Ko Queequeg a George Washington i whakawhanakehia ma te kai tangata.
    </p>
    <p>
       I a au e ata titiro ana ki a ia, he haurua te ahua e titiro ana ahau ki te awha mai i te taha o te awhi, kare ia i aro ki toku aroaro, kare rawa ia i raru noa i te titiro kotahi; engari i tino pukumahi ki te tatau i nga wharangi o te pukapuka whakamiharo. Ma te whakaaro ki te pai o ta maua moe tahi i te po o mua, me te whakaaro ano ki te ringa aroha i kitea e au i runga i ahau i te oho ake i te ata, ka whakaaro ahau ko te koretake o tana tino rerekee. Engari he tangata ke te mohoao; i etahi wa kaore koe e tino mohio ki te tango. I te tuatahi kei te kaha ratou; Ko to ratou kohi-whaiaro marie o te ngawari te ahua o te whakaaro nui a Socratic. I kite ano ahau kaore rawa a Queequeg i noho tahi, he iti noa ranei, me era atu heramana i roto i te whare tira. Kahore ia i neke ake; karekau he hiahia ki te whakanui i te porowhita o ana hoa mohio. Ko enei mea katoa i pa mai ki ahau he tangata tino nui; heoi, ki te whakaaro tuarua, he mea tino ataahua kei roto. Tenei tetahi tangata e rua tekau mano maero te tawhiti atu i te kainga, i te huarahi ki Cape Horn, ara—koinei anake te huarahi e tae atu ai ia ki reira—ka maka ki roto i nga tangata rereke ki a ia me te mea kei roto ia i te aorangi Hupita; heoi i ata noho humarie ia; te tiaki i te tino marie; ka makona ki tana ake hoa; rite tonu ki a ia ano. He pono he pa tenei o te whakaaro pai; ahakoa karekau rawa ia i rongo he ahua penei. Engari, penei pea, hei tohunga mohio, kaua tatou e tino mohio ki te noho ora, ki te tohe. I taku rongonga he tangata pera, he tangata pera ranei e tuku ana i a ia ano hei tohunga whakaaro, ka whakatau ahau, penei me te kuia mate pukupuku, kua &quot;pakaru tana digester.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       I ahau e noho ana i roto i taua ruma mokemoke inaianei; te mura o te ahi, i roto i te ata ngawari, i muri i te whakamahanatanga o te hau tuatahi, katahi ka mura te titiro; ko nga marumaru o te ahiahi me nga phantoms e huihui ana i nga taha o nga pouaka, me te titiro mai ki runga ki a matou e rua noho puku, mokemoke; te tupuhi e pupuhi ana i waho i roto i nga awha nui; I timata ahau ki te mohio ki nga ahuatanga ke. I rongo ahau i te rewa i roto i ahau. Kua mutu taku ngakau marara me taku ringa porangi kua huri ki te ao wuruhi. Na tenei mohoao whakamarie i hoko. I reira ia i noho ai, ko tana tino kore whakaaro e korero ana i te ahua o te kore e huna i te hunga tinihanga me nga mahi tinihanga. He mohoao ia; he tino tirohanga ki nga tirohanga; heoi ka anga ahau ki te whakaaro ngaro ahau ki a ia. A ko aua mea ano ka peia e te nuinga o etahi atu, ko enei nga aukume i kukume mai i ahau. Ka whakamatau ahau i tetahi hoa etene, i whakaaro ahau, i te mea kua kitea te atawhai Karaitiana engari he koretake. Ka kumea e ahau taku tauera ki te taha o ia, ka mahia etahi tohu me nga tohu whakahoa, ka whakapau kaha ahau ki te korero ki a ia i tenei wa. I te tuatahi, he iti noa iho tana kite i enei ahunga whakamua; engari i tenei wa, i taku korerotanga mo ana manaakitanga o te po whakamutunga, ka puta mai tana patai ki a au mehemea ka noho tahi ano maua ki te moenga. I ki atu ahau ki a ia ae; i whakaaro ahau he pai tana ahua, he iti nei te mihi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Na ka huri tahi maua i te pukapuka, ka whakapau kaha ahau ki te whakamarama ki a ia i te take o te perehitanga, me te tikanga o nga pikitia torutoru kei roto. Koia ahau i hohoro ai te whakauru atu ki a ia; mai i tera ka haere matou ki te korero korero mo nga momo tirohanga o waho ka kitea i tenei taone rongonui. Kare i roa ka tono ahau i te auahi hapori; a, i tana whakaputanga i tana putea me tana tomahawk, ka tukuna marie e ia he pupuhi ki ahau. Katahi matou ka noho ki te whakawhiti puffs mai i tana paipa mohoao, me te haere tonu i waenganui ia matou.
    </p>
    <p>
       Mena kei te noho tonu tetahi huka o te kore whakaaro ki ahau i roto i te uma o te Pagan, ko tenei paoa pai, tino pai i a matou, kaore i roa ka rewa, ka mahue matou he hoa. Ko te ahua i haria mai e ia ki ahau he rite tonu ki ahau, me te kore i tono mai ki ahau; a ka pau ta maua paoa, ka pehia e ia tona rae ki toku rae, ka awhi i toku hope, ka mea kua marenatia taua; Ko te tikanga, i roto i te korero a tona whenua, he hoa aroha maua; ka mate ia mo ahau, ki te tika. I roto i te tangata whenua, ko tenei mura ohooho o te whakahoa he ahua omaoma rawa, he mea e kore e whakaponohia; engari i roto i tenei mohoao ngawari e kore aua ture tawhito e pa.
    </p>
    <p>
       I muri i te kai, me tetahi atu korerorero me te paowa, ka haere tahi matou ki to matou ruma. I homai ano e ia he hakari ki ahau i roto i tona matenga whakapakokotia; ka tango i tana putea tupeka nui, ka whawha i raro i te tupeka, ka tangohia mai etahi e toru tekau taara hiriwa; ka horahia ki runga i te tepu, ka wehewehea kia rua nga wahanga riterite, ka pana tetahi o aua mea ki ahau, ka ki mai naku. I haere ahau ki te whakahe; engari i wahangu ia i ahau, ringihia ana e ia ki roto ki nga pukoro o oku tarau. I tukua e ahau kia noho ratou. Katahi ia ka haere ki te karakia o te ahiahi, ka tangohia tana whakapakoko, ka tangohia te papa ahi pepa. Na etahi tohu me etahi tohu, i whakaaro ahau kei te pirangi ia kia uru atu ahau ki a ia; engari i te tino mohio ki nga mea e whai ake nei, ka whakaaro ahau mo tetahi wa, mena ka tono mai ia ki ahau, ka whakaae ahau ki te kore ranei.
    </p>
    <p>
       He Karaitiana pai ahau; i whanau mai i roto i te kopu o te Hahi Perehipitiriana kore e he. Na me pehea e taea ai e ahau te hono tahi me tenei kaikarakia mohoao ki te karakia ki tana rakau? Engari he aha te karakia? Ka whakaaro koe inaianei, e Ihimaera, ko te Atua nui o te rangi me te whenua—te hunga etene me te katoa—ka hae ranei ki tetahi wahi iti o te rakau mangu? Kare e taea! Engari he aha te karakia?—te mahi i te hiahia o te Atua— 
      <i>
        te
      </i>
       karakia. E aha te hinaaro o te Atua?—ia rave i to ’u taata tupu mai ta ’u e hinaaro ia rave mai to ’u taata tupu ia ’u— 
      <i>
        o
      </i>
       te hinaaro ïa o te Atua. Na, ko Queequeg toku hoa tangata. A he aha taku e pai ai kia meatia e tenei Kuini ki ahau? No te aha, a tahoê mai ia ’u i roto i ta ’u huru haamoriraa taa ê presbyterian. No reira, me hono ahau ki a ia i roto i tona; no reira, me tahuri ahau ki te karakia whakapakoko. Na ka tahuna e ahau nga heu; i awhina ki te tautoko i te whakapakoko iti harakore; hoatu ana he pihikete tahu ki a ia me Queequeg; e rua, e toru ranei nga mihi ki tona aroaro; ka kihi i tona ihu; ka mutu, ka wetekina e matou nga kakahu, ka moe, ma te rangimarie me o matou ake hinengaro me te ao katoa. Engari kaore matou i moe me te kore korero iti.
    </p>
    <p>
       He pehea ra, kahore ahau e mohio; engari karekau he waahi hei moenga mo nga korero matatapu i waenga i nga hoa. Te tane e te vahine, te parau ra ratou, i reira e matara ai te hohonuraa o to raua varua te tahi i te tahi; me etahi o nga hoa faaipoipo tawhito e takoto korero ana i nga wa tawhito tae noa ki te ata. No reira, i roto i o maua ngakau honi, e takoto ana ahau me Queequeg—he pai, he tokorua aroha.

       UPOKO 11. Kaahu moe.
    </h2>
    <p>
       I takoto matou i runga i te moenga, e korerorero ana, e moe moe ana i etahi wa poto, katahi ano ka whiua e Queequeg ona waewae moko parauri ki runga i oku waewae, katahi ka hoki whakamuri; he tino whakahoahoa, he kore utu, he ngawari hoki matou; Ka mutu, na to matou poauautanga, ka mutu te pouri i toe i roto i a matou, a ka pai matou ki te maranga ake, ahakoa kei te tata tonu te awatea.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ae, i tino mataara matou; no te mea ka timata to matou nohonga ki runga i te ngenge, ka iti noa te noho; ko nga kakahu e mau ana ki runga i a matou, e okioki ana ki te upoko-papa me o matou turi e wha e piri tata ana, me o matou ihu e rua e piko ana ki runga, me he mea whakamahana o matou turi. He tino pai, he pai hoki to matou ahua, i te mea he tino makariri i waho o nga kuaha; i waho ano o ratou kakahu, i te mea kahore he ahi o roto. Ko te mea nui ake, ko taku kii, na te mea kia pai ai te mahana o te tinana, me makariri etahi wahi iti o koutou, no te mea karekau he kounga o tenei ao ehara i te mea he rereke noa iho. Kaore he mea i roto i a ia ano. Mena kei te patipati koe ki a koe ano kua tino pai koe, a kua roa koe, kare e taea te kii he pai koe. Engari ki te rite ki a maua ko Queequeg i runga i te moenga, he paku makariri te pito o to ihu, te karauna o to mahunga ranei, he aha ra, i runga i te maaramatanga ka tino pai koe, ka tino mahana. Mo konei kaua rawa e whakakakaa ki te ahi te whare moenga, koinei tetahi o nga mea whakararu o te hunga whai rawa. No te mea ko te teitei o tenei momo reka he kore noa iho ko te paraikete kei waenganui i a koe me to tanga me te makariri o te hau o waho. I reira ka takoto koe ano he korakora mahana i roto i te ngakau o te karaihe Arctic.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kua roa matou e noho ana i runga i tenei tuohu, katahi ano ka whakaaro ahau ka ara ake oku kanohi; i te mea kei waenganui i nga whariki, ahakoa i te awatea, ahakoa i te po, ahakoa e moe ana, e ara ana ranei, kei a au te huarahi ki te kati i oku kanohi i nga wa katoa, kia kaha ake ai te aro atu ki te maru o te moenga. No te mea kare e taea e te tangata te mohio tika ki tona ake tangata ki te kore e kati ona kanohi; me te mea ko te pouri te kaupapa tika o o tatou tino, ahakoa he pai ake te marama ki to tatou wahi paru. I te whakatuwheratanga o oku kanohi i tera wa, ka puta mai i roto i taku ake pouri ahuareka, i hanga e au ki roto i te pouri o waho o te tekau ma rua karaka-i te po, ka kite ahau i te riri kino. Kare rawa hoki ahau i whakahe ki te tohu a Queequeg, tera pea he pai ki te patu i te rama, i te mea kua tino mataara tatou; i tua atu i a ia i kaha te hiahia ki te tango i etahi pupuhi ata mai i tana Tomahawk. Me kii, ahakoa kua tino kino ahau ki tana kai paipa i runga i te moenga i te po i mua atu, ka kite koe i te kaha o te tipu o o tatou whakaaro kino ina tae mai te aroha ki te whakapiko. Inaianei kua pai ake ahau ki te kai paipa a Queequeg i toku taha, ahakoa i runga i te moenga, no te mea kua ki tonu ia i te koa o te whare i taua wa. Kua kore ahau i tino awangawanga mo te kaupapa here inihua a te kaiwhakarëti. I ora noa ahau ki te noho humarie matatapu o te tiri paipa me te paraikete ki tetahi hoa pono. Na o matou koti puhuruhuru i tohia ki o matou pakihiwi, ka whakawhiti atu matou i te Tomahawk mai i tetahi ki tetahi, tae noa ki te puhoi haere mai o te paoa kikorangi e iri ana ki runga i a matou, kua whakamaramatia e te mura o te rama hou.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ahakoa na tenei kai-whakamatautau i a ia i huri te mohoao ki nga waahi tawhiti, kaore au i te mohio, engari i korero ia inaianei mo tona motu taketake; a, no te hiahia ki te whakarongo ki tona hitori, ka tohe ahau ki a ia kia haere tonu ki te korero. Ua farii oia ma te oaoa. Ahakoa i taua wa kaore au i tino mohio ki etahi o ana kupu, engari ko nga korero o muri mai, i taku mohiotanga ake ki ana kupu pakaru, inaianei ka taea e au te whakaatu i te katoa o nga korero penei i roto i te anga anga ka hoatu e ahau.

       UPOKO 12. Haurongo.
    </h2>
    <p>
       He tangata whenua a Queequeg no Rokovoko, he motu kei tawhiti atu ki te hauauru me te tonga. Kaore i raro i tetahi mapi; Ko nga waahi pono kaore rawa.
    </p>
    <p>
       I te wa e omaoma ana te mohoao hou i roto i nga ngahere o tona whenua i roto i te karu tarutaru, ka whai ko nga koati e kai ana, ano he mahuri kaakaariki; ahakoa i tera wa, i roto i te wairua whakahirahira o Queequeg, i huna e ia te hiahia nui ki te kite i tetahi mea nui atu i te Karaitiana i tetahi tauira tohorā, tokorua ranei. Ko tona papa he Rangatira Nui, he Kingi; he tohunga nui tona matua keke; ā, i te taha ki te taha whaea, i whakahīhītia e ia ngā kōkā he wahine nā ngā toa e kore e taea te hinga. He toto pai i roto i ona uaua—he taonga kingi; Ahakoa i pouri ahau, e wehi ana ahau, na te hiahia kai tangata i whangai ia i tona taitamarikitanga.
    </p>
    <p>
       I toro atu te kaipuke o Sag Harbour ki te kokoru o tona papa, ka rapu a Queequeg ki nga whenua Karaitiana. Engari ko te kaipuke, me ona kaieke moana katoa, ka whakaparahako i tona kakahu; a kahore i taea e te Kingi katoa te mana o tona papa. Engari i oati a Queequeg. Ko ia anake i runga i tana waka, ka hoe atu ki tetahi kuiti tawhiti, i mohio ia me whiti te kaipuke ina wehe ia i te motu. Kei tetahi taha he toka kao; ki tetahi atu he arero iti o te whenua, kapi ana i nga puia rakau mangrove ka tipu ki te wai. E huna ana i tana waka, e mau tonu ana, i roto i enei puia, me te ihu ki te moana, ka noho ki te kei, ka hoe te ringa; a, i te terenga o te kaipuke, ano he uira, ka puta ki waho; riro tona taha; kotahi te tukinga whakamuri o tona waewae ka huri, ka totohu tona waka; kake ake nga mekameka; ka rukea atu e ia ki runga ki te rahoraho, ka mau ki te raka mo te mowhiti, ka oati kia kaua e tukua, ahakoa kua motumotuhia.
    </p>
    <p>
       Mo te kore noa iho te whakawehi a te kapene kia maka ia ki te moana; i whakatarewatia he karaiti ki runga i ona ringa tahanga; He tama a Queequeg na te Kingi, a kihai a Queequeg i whakakorikori. Na te kaha o tona ngakau kore, me tana hiahia nui ki te toro atu ki te Karaitiana, ka whakaae te kapene, ka kii ki a ia ka noho ia ki te kainga. Engari ko tenei kuao mohoao pai—te Piriniha o Wera o te moana, kaore i kite i te whare o te Kapene. Ka whakatakotoria ia ki raro i nga heramana, ka waiho hei tangata tohorā. Engari ka rite ki a Czar Peter i pai ki te mahi i roto i nga waahi kaipuke o nga taone ke, kaore a Queequeg i whakahawea ki te ahua whakahawea, mena ka koa ia ki te whai mana ki te whakamarama i ona tangata whenua kore. No te mea i raro—ko tana kii mai ki ahau—na te hiahia nui ki te ako i roto i nga Karaitiana, ki nga mahi toi e pai ake ai te hari o tona iwi i a ratou; a nui atu i tera, pai ake i era. Engari, aue! na nga mahi a nga kaipatu tohorā i tino mohio ia ka taea e nga Karaitiana te pouri me te kino; nui atu i nga tauiwi katoa o tona papa. I tae atu ki te whanga tawhito o Sag; a ka titiro ki nga mahi a nga heramana ki reira; Katahi ka haere ki Nantucket, ka kite i te whakapaunga o a ratou utu ki 
      <i>
        taua
      </i>
       wahi, ka tukua e te rawakore a Queequeg mo te ngaro. I whakaaro ia, he ao kino i roto i nga meridian katoa; Ka mate ahau he etene.
    </p>
    <p>
       Na he tangata karakia whakapakoko tawhito ia, i noho tonu ia i waenganui i enei Karaitiana, ka mau i o ratou kakahu, ka ngana ki te korero i o raatau korero. No reira te ahua kee ki a ia, ahakoa inaianei he wa mai i te kainga.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ma nga tohu, ka patai atu au ki a ia mehemea kaore ia i tono kia hoki mai, ka whai koroneihana; i te mea ka mahara ia kua mate tona papa, kua riro, he tino koroheke, he ngoikore hoki i nga korero whakamutunga. Ka whakahokia e ia kahore, kahore ano; me te kii ano he Karaitiana mataku ia, he Karaitiana ranei, kaore ia i tau kia eke ia ki runga ki te torona parakore, pokekore o nga Kingi e toru tekau i mua i a ia. Tera râ, i muri iho, ua parau oia, e ho‘i mai oia,—i te taime iho â oia i ite ai e ua bapetizo-faahou-hia oia. Heoi ano, ka whakaaro ia ki te whakatere haere, ki te rui i ana oati mohoao ki nga moana e wha. Na ratou i hanga he totoro ki a ia, a ko taua rino tarau hei whakakapi mo te hepeta inaianei.
    </p>
    <p>
       I patai atu ahau ki a ia he aha tana kaupapa tonu, e pa ana ki ana nekehanga a meake nei. Ka whakahoki ia, kia haere ano ki te moana, ki tana mahi o mua. I runga i tenei, ka kii atu ahau ki a ia ko te patu tohorā naku ake te mahi, me taku korero ki a ia mo taku hiahia kia rere atu i Nantucket, ko te tauranga tino pai rawa atu mo te tangata whai tohorā ka eke mai. Ka whakatau tonu ia ki te haere i ahau ki tera motu, ki runga ki te kaipuke kotahi, ka eke ki te mataaratanga kotahi, ki te poti kotahi, ki ahau ano, mo te poto ki te tiri i aku hap katoa; me oku ringa e rua i roto i a ia, maia ki roto ki te Potluck o nga ao e rua. I whakaae ahau ki enei mea katoa; i tua atu i taku aroha i naianei ki a Queequeg, he tangata mohio ia ki te mahi harpoone, no reira, e kore e taea e ia te tino whai hua ki te tangata, penei me ahau, kua kore e tino mohio ki nga mea ngaro o te patu tohorā, ahakoa e mohio ana ki te moana, e mohiotia ana e nga kaieke hokohoko.
    </p>
    <p>
       I te mutunga o tana korero ki te pupuhi o tana putorino, ka awhi a Queequeg i ahau, ka pehia tona rae ki toku rae, ka puhipuhi te rama, ka huri mai tetahi ki tetahi, i tera taha, i tera, i tera, kaore i roa kua moe.

       Ka tarewa matou i te wira wira, ka eke ki runga i a matou mea, tae atu ki taku ake peeke whariki rawakore, me te peke taratara me te hamau a Queequeg, ka haere ki raro ki te “Moss,” ko te kuna pakupaku o Nantucket i mau ki te wapu. I a matou e haere ana ka titiro te iwi; kare i Queequeg nui—no te mea kua waia ratou ki te kite i nga kai tangata penei i a ia i o ratou tiriti,—engari i te kitenga i a ia me ahau i runga i aua kupu huna. Heoi kare matou i aro ki a ratou, ka huri haere matou i runga i te wira o te pere, ka mutu a Queequeg i tenei wa, i muri iho ka tu ki te whakatika i te hiku ki runga i ana pae. I patai atu ahau ki a ia he aha i mauria ai e ia he mea whakararu i a ia ki uta, me te kore e kitea e nga kaipuke whai tohorā a ratou ake torere. Ki tenei, i roto i te tino, ka whakahoki ia, ahakoa he pono te mea i kiihia e ahau, engari he tino aroha ia ki tana ake harpoon, no te mea he mea pono, he pai te whakamatau i roto i te maha o nga whawhai tahuti, me te tino piri ki nga ngakau. o nga tohorā. Hei poto, penei i te tini o nga kaikooti me nga kaikokoti i uta, e haere ana ki roto i nga wiwi a nga kaiahuwhenua me a ratou maripi tonu—ahakoa karekau he tikanga ki te whakawhiwhi i a ratou—heoi, i pai ake a Queequeg, mo ona ake take, ki tana ake hakinakina.
    </p>
    <p>
       I te huri i te pere mai i toku ringa ki tona, ka korerotia e ia he korero whakakatakata mo te wira wira tuatahi kua kite ia. I te whanga o Sag. Ko nga rangatira o tana kaipuke, te ahua nei, i tuku moni ki a ia, hei kawe i tona uma taumaha ki tona whare noho. Ehara i te ahua kuare mo taua mea—ahakoa he tino tika ia, mo te huarahi tika mo te whakahaere i te pere—e tuu ana a Queequeg i tona uma ki runga; ka whiu tere; katahi ka amohia te waka, ka piki ki runga i te wapu. &quot;He aha,&quot; ka kii ahau, &quot;Queequeg, kua mohio pea koe i tera, ka whakaaro tetahi. Kaore nga tangata i kata?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I runga i tenei, ka korerotia e ia ki ahau tetahi atu korero. Ko nga tangata o tona motu o Rokovoko, te ahua nei, i a ratou hakari marena e whakaatu ana i te wai kakara o te niu kokonati ki roto i te tahā paru nui ano he punchbowl; Ka noho tonu tenei punchbowl hei whakapaipai nui o te pokapū i runga i te whariki whiri i te waahi e tu ai te hakari. Inaianei kua u mai tetahi kaipuke hokohoko nui ki Rokovoko, me tona rangatira—mai i nga korero katoa, he tangata tino ataahua, he rangatira mo te moana—i powhiritia tenei rangatira ki te hakari marena a te tuahine o Queequeg, he kuini ataahua kua huri mai. o te tekau. Kaati; ka huihui katoa nga manuhiri marena ki te whare bamboo o te wahine marena hou, ka haere mai tenei Kapene, ka whakawhiwhia ki te pou o te honore, ka tu ki te taha o te punchbowl, ki waenganui hoki i te Tohunga Nui me tona ariki te Kingi, te papa o Queequeg. Ko te kii a Grace,—no te mea he aroha ano enei tangata ki a tatou ano—ahakoa i kii mai a Queequeg ki ahau kaore i rite ki a tatou, e titiro whakararo ana ki a tatou pereti, he kape i nga parera, ka anga whakarunga ki te Kai homai. o nga hakari katoa—Ko te aroha noa, e kii ana ahau, ka whakatuwheratia e te Tohunga Nui te hakari i runga i nga tikanga o mua o te motu; ara, toua ana maihao tapu me ona maihao ki roto i te peihana i mua i te rere o te inu manaaki. I tana kitenga i a ia e noho ana ki te taha o te Tohunga, me te kite i te huihuinga, me te whakaaro ko ia ano he Kapene mo te kaipuke—he tino rangatira ake ia i te Kingi o te motu, ina koa i roto i te whare o te Kingi ake—ka horoi marie te Kapene i ona ringa ki te punchbowl. ;—te tango i te reira whakaaro ahau mo te nui maihao-karaihe. “Na,” te kii a Queequeg, “e aha ana koe inaianei?—Kaore ranei o matou iwi i kata?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Ka mutu, ka utua te utu, ka noho haumaru nga tueke, ka tu matou ki runga i te kuna. Ka hiki te ra, ka rere ki raro i te awa o Acushnet. I tetahi taha, ka ara ake a New Bedford ki nga papa o nga tiriti, ko o ratou rakau kua kapi i te hukapapa e kanapa katoa ana i te hau marama, makariri. Ko nga puke nunui me nga maunga o nga putea kei runga i nga putea kua putuhia ki runga i ona waapu, a, i te taha o te taha o nga kaipuke tohorā e kopikopiko ana i te ao, i te wahangu, ka u marie i te mutunga; I etahi atu ka pa mai te haruru o nga kamura me nga kaipakihi, me nga haruru o te ahi me nga whariki hei whakarewa i te ware, e tohu ana kei te timata nga waka hou; ka mutu tetahi haerenga tino kino me te roa, ka timata te tuarua; ka mutu te tuarua, ka timata te tuatoru, ka mutu, mo ake tonu atu, mo ake tonu atu. Koia te mutunga kore, ae ra, te kore e taea e nga mahi katoa o te whenua.
    </p>
    <p>
       I te kaha ake o te wai tuwhera, ka hou te hau kaha; ka maka e te Pūkohu nohinohi te pahuka i ana kopere, me te kuao kuao e hongi ana. Ano taku hongi i taua hau Taratara!—Aue i taku whakahawea ki taua whenua takahuri!—te huanui whanui puta noa i nga taha katoa kua toka ki nga tohu o nga rekereke me nga maikuku; a tahuri ana ahau ki te whakamihi i te nui o te moana e kore nei e tukua kia tuhia.
    </p>
    <p>
       I taua puna pahuka i te ahua, ka inu a Queequeg me te oho me ahau. Ka pupuhi ona pongaihu pouri; i whakaatu ia i ona niho tiihi me te tiwha. Ka rere, ka rere matou; a ka riro mai a matou whakahere, ka koropiko te Mokohu ki te hau; ka rukuhia ana kopere hei taurekareka ki te aroaro o te Sultan. Ko te okiokinga taha, ko ta matou i topa; ko nga taura katoa e tangi ana ano he waea; ko nga tio roroa e rua e kopikopiko ana ano he kakaho Inia i roto i nga awhiowhio whenua. No te ki tonu o matou i tenei ahua ohooho, i a matou e tu ana i te taha o te pupuhi kopere, mo etahi wa kare matou i kite i te tawai o nga kaihihi, he huihuinga rite ki te lubber, e miharo ana ki te pai o nga hoa tokorua; me te mea ko te tangata ma he mea nui ake i te negro kua ma. Engari i reira etahi potiki me nga puku, na te kaha o te kakariki, i ahu mai i te ngakau me te puku o nga otaota katoa. I mau a Queequeg i tetahi o enei mahuri e whakatauira ana i a ia i muri i tona tuara. I whakaaro ahau kua tae mai te haora o te mate o te bumpkin. I te tukunga iho o tana harpoon, ka mau te mohoao i a ia ki roto i ona ringa, a, na te tino mahi whakamiharo me te kaha, ka tukuna atu ia ki runga ki te rangi; katahi ka paopao paku i tana kei i waenganui o te waahi, ka tau mai te tangata nei me te pupuhi o ona waewae, ko Queequeg, ka huri tuara ki runga ki a ia, ka tahuna tana paipa tomahawk ka tukuna mai ki ahau mo te pupuhi.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Te hopu! Te hopu!” ka karanga atu te tuki, ka oma ki taua apiha; “Te hopu, te hopu, tenei te rewera.”

    <p>
       “Kia ora, 
      <i>
        e te

       rangatira,” te karanga a te Kapene, he riu o te moana, e toro atu ana ki a Queequeg, “he aha te tikanga o te whatitiri? Kaore koe i te mohio kua mate pea koe i taua pene?”
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;He aha tana korero?&quot; ka mea a Queequeg, i tana tahuri mai ki ahau.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;E ki ana ia,&quot; ka mea ahau, &quot;i tata koe ki te patu-e taua tangata i reira,&quot; ka tohu atu ki te haona e wiri tonu ana.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Kill-e,” ka karanga a Queequeg, ka whiria e ia tona mata moko ki te ahua kino o te whakahawea, “ah! him bevy small-e ika-e; Queequeg no kill-e pera iti-e ika-e; Ka patua e Queequeg te tohorā nui!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Tirohia koe,” ka hamama te Kapene, “Ka patua 
      <i>
        koe
      </i>
       e ahau, e te kai tangata, ki te whakamatau koe i au mahi tinihanga i runga nei; na kia mahara ki to kanohi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Engari i taua wa, kua tae ki te wa e mahara ai te Kapene ki tona ake kanohi. Na te kaha nui o te ra nui kua wehea te raurangi huarere, a, kua rere te pupuhi nui mai i tera taha ki tera taha, kua kapi katoa i tera taha o te rahoraho. Ko te tangata rawakore i tukinotia e Queequeg, ka tahia ki te moana; i ohooho nga ringa katoa; a ki te ngana ki te kapo i te pupuhi kia noho tonu, he ahua porangi. Ka rere mai i te taha matau ki te taha maui, ka hoki ano, tata ki te kotahi tohu o te wati, a ko nga wa katoa ka rite ki te waahi ka pakaru ki roto i nga marara. Kaore he mea i mahia, kaore he mea e taea te mahi; Ko te hunga i runga i te rahoraho ka oma ki nga ihu, ka tu ki te titiro ki te kopapa me te mea ko te kauae raro o te tohorā kua pukuriri. I waenganui o tenei raruraru, ka topa iho a Queequeg ki ona turi, ka ngokingoki i raro i te ara o te pupuhi, ka mau ki te taura, ka mau tetahi pito ki nga parepare, katahi ka werohia tetahi pito ano he laso, ka mau ki te taha o te pupuhi. I te wa e pa ana ki runga i tona mahunga, a, i te wa o muri mai, ka mau te moka, ka ora katoa. Ka rere te kuna ki te hau, a, i te wa e horoi ana nga ringa i te kei o te poti, ka tihorea a Queequeg ki tona hope, ka oma atu i te taha me te peke roa o te peke. Mo te toru meneti neke atu ranei ka kitea ia e kauhoe ana ano he kuri, e maka ana i ona ringa roroa ki mua i a ia, ka huri ka kitea ona pakihiwi pakari i roto i te pahukapapa mīti. I titiro ahau ki te tangata nui me te kororia, engari kaore he tangata e ora. Kua heke te haona matomato. Ko Queequeg te pupuhi i a ia ano mai i te wai, ka titiro tata ki a ia, me te ahua kei te kite i te ahua o nga take, ka ruku ki raro ka ngaro. He meneti torutoru, ka whakatika ano ia, ko tetahi ringa e patu tonu ana, ko tetahi e toia ana he ahua kore. Kaore i roa ka mauria mai e te poti. I whakahokia mai te karekau. I pooti nga ringa katoa ki a Queequeg hei tetere rangatira; ka tono te kapene kia murua. Mai i taua haora ka piri ahau ki Queequeg ano he witi; ae ra, tae noa ki te ruku a Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I penei ano te pohehe? Ko te ahua karekau ia i whakaaro e tika ana kia whakawhiwhia ia ki te mētara mai i te Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He wai noa tana tono—he wai hou—he mea hei muru i te tote; ka oti, ka kakahu ia i nga kakahu maroke, ka tahuna tana paipa, ka okioki ki nga parepare, me te ata titiro ki te hunga e tata ana ki a ia, me te mea kei te kii ki a ia ano—“He ao tahi, he ao hono, i roto i nga meridian katoa. Me awhina tatou nga kai tangata i enei Karaitiana.&quot;

       UPOKO 14. Nantucket.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Kaore he mea i tupu i runga i te waahanga e tika ana kia whakahuahia; no reira, i muri i te oma pai, ka tae marie matou ki Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nantucket! Tangohia to mapi ka titiro. Tirohia te tino kokonga o te ao e nohoia ana; me pehea te tu ki reira, tawhiti atu i uta, mokemoke ake i te whare rama a Eddystone. Titiro—he puke noa, he tuke onepu; takutai katoa, kahore he papamuri. He nui ake te onepu i reira ka whakamahia e koe i roto i nga tau e rua tekau hei whakakapi mo te pepa muru. Ka kii etahi o nga wights ki a koe me whakato taru ki reira, kaore e tipu noa; kei te kawe mai ratou i nga tataramoa o Kanata; me tuku ki tawahi o nga moana mo te putunga hei aukati i te pakaru i roto i te ipu hinu; ko nga wahi rakau i Nantucket e haria haere ana ano he moka o te ripeka pono i Roma; kia whakatoia e nga tangata o reira he kurupae ki mua i o ratou whare, hei whakamarumaru i te wa raumati; kia kotahi te rau o te tarutaru hei oasis, e toru nga mata o te ra e haere ana i te awaawa; e mau hu onepu tere, he rite ki nga hu hukarere Laplander; ka tutakina, ka whitikia, ka kopakia, ka karapotia, ka waiho hei motu puta noa i te moana, ka kitea ki o ratou tuuru me o ratou teepu etahi pipi iti e piri ana, pera me nga tuara o nga honu moana. Engari ko enei taapiri e whakaatu ana ko Nantucket ehara i a Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
       Titiro inaianei ki nga korero tuku iho whakamiharo mo te nohonga o tenei motu e nga tangata whero. Koia te korero. I nga wa o mua ka rere atu te ekara ki te takutai o Niu Ingarani, ka mauria atu he kohungahunga Inia i roto i ona tarau. He nui te tangi a nga matua i te kitenga atu i ta raua tamaiti e mauria ana i runga i nga wai whanui. Ka whakatau ratou ki te whai i te huarahi kotahi. Ka eke ki runga i o ratou waka, i muri i te haerenga kino ka kitea te motu, ka kitea he pouaka rei korekore,—ko te anga o te iti o Inia.
    </p>
    <p>
       He aha te miharo, ko enei Nantucketers, i whanau i te takutai, ka haere ki te moana ki te whai oranga! I mau tuatahi ratou i te papaka me te quohog i te onepu; ka maia, ka haere ki waho me te kupenga mo te tawatawa; he nui ake te mohio, ka pana atu i runga poti, ka hopu i te cod; ka mutu, ka whakarewahia he kaipuke nui ki runga i te moana, ka tirotirohia tenei ao wai; Whakanohoia he whitiki taiawhio haere a tawhio noa; ka titiro ki te moana o Behring; e i roto i te mau tau atoa e te mau moana atoa i faaite i te tama‘i mure ore e te mau taata puai roa ’‘e i ora mai i te diluvi; tino whakamataku me te tino maunga! Ko taua Himmalehan, te moana tote Mastodon, he mea whakakakahu ki te ahua o te kaha kore mohio, he nui ake te wehi o ona mataku i ana whakaeke tino wehi me te kino!
    </p>
    <p>
       Na, ko enei Nantucketers tahanga, ko enei kaipatu moana, e puta mai ana i to ratou puke popokorua i te moana, ka eke ki runga, ka hinga i te ao wai pera i te tini o nga Alexanders; ka wehewehe i roto i a ratou ko te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa, Moananui-a-Kiwa me Inia, pera i nga mana kaitiora e toru i mahia e Poroni. Tukua a Amerika ki te tapiri atu i a Mexico ki Texas, me whakapurau a Cuba ki runga ki Kanata; ma te Ingarani e whakamahana i a Inia katoa, me whakairi to ratou kara mura mai i te ra; Ko te rua hautoru o tenei ao matawhenua ko te Nantucketer&#39;s. Nona hoki te moana; kei a ia ano, pera me nga Emepera he rangatiratanga; ko etahi o nga kaieke moana e whai mana ana ki reira. Ko nga kaipuke hokohoko he piriti toronga; he mau patu engari he pa maanu; ahakoa nga kaitiora me nga tangata whenua, ahakoa e whai ana i te moana hei tangata huanui i te huarahi, engari ka pahuatia e ratou etahi atu kaipuke, etahi atu kongakonga o te whenua pera ano me ratou, kahore hoki e whai ki te whai oranga i roto i te rire o raro. Ko te Nantucketer, ko ia anake e noho ana me te ngangau i runga i te moana; ko ia anake, i roto i te reo Paipera, ka heke ki reira i runga kaipuke; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. 
      <i>
        There
      </i>
       is his home; 
      <i>
        there
      </i>
       lies his business, which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.

       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”

       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.

       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
