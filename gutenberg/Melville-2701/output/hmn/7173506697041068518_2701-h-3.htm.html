       QHOV 10. Ib tug phooj ywg Bosom.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Rov qab mus rau Spouter-Inn los ntawm lub tsev teev ntuj, kuv pom Queequeg nyob ib leeg; nws tau tawm ntawm lub Tsev Teev Ntuj ua ntej kev txais txiaj ntsig qee zaum. Nws tau zaum ntawm ib lub rooj zaum ua ntej qhov hluav taws kub, nrog nws ob txhais taw ntawm lub qhov cub hearth, thiab nyob rau hauv ib txhais tes tau tuav ze rau ntawm nws lub ntsej muag uas me ntsis negro tus mlom ntawm nws; peering nyuaj rau hauv nws lub ntsej muag, thiab nrog ib rab riam maj mam whittling tam sim ntawd ntawm nws lub qhov ntswg, lub sijhawm no humming rau nws tus kheej hauv nws txoj kev heathenish.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tab sis tam sim no cuam tshuam, nws tau tso duab; thiab zoo nkauj sai sai, mus rau lub rooj, nqa ib phau ntawv loj nyob rau ntawd, thiab muab tso rau ntawm nws ceg tawv pib suav cov nplooj ntawv nrog txhob txwm tsis tu ncua; nyob rau hauv txhua nplooj ntawv tsib caug—raws li kuv xav — nres ib pliag, saib tsis taus ib ncig ntawm nws, thiab hais lus rau ib tug ntev-drawn gurgling xuav ntawm kev xav tsis thoob. Nws mam li pib dua ntawm tsib caug tom ntej; zoo li pib ntawm tus naj npawb ib txhua zaus, zoo li nws tsis tuaj yeem suav ntau tshaj tsib caug, thiab tsuas yog los ntawm ntau tsib caug tau pom ua ke, uas nws xav tsis thoob ntawm ntau nplooj ntawv tau zoo siab.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nrog kev txaus siab heev kuv zaum saib nws. Savage txawm tias nws yog, thiab tsis txaus ntseeg ntawm lub ntsej muag—tsawg kawg rau kuv saj—nws lub ntsej muag tseem muaj ib yam dab tsi hauv nws uas tsis yog qhov tsis txaus ntseeg. Koj zais tsis tau tus ntsuj plig. Los ntawm tag nrho nws cov tattooing unearthly, kuv xav tias kuv pom cov cim ntawm lub siab ncaj ncees; thiab nyob rau hauv nws lub qhov muag loj, tob tob, fiery dub thiab siab tawv, zoo nkaus li tokens ntawm tus ntsuj plig uas yuav twv ib txhiab dab ntxwg nyoog. Thiab ntxiv rau tag nrho cov no, muaj qee qhov kev coj tus cwj pwm zoo txog Pagan, uas txawm tias nws qhov kev tsis txaus siab tsis tuaj yeem ua rau tag nrho. Nws zoo li ib tug txiv neej uas tsis tau quaj thiab tsis tau muaj tus neeg qiv nyiaj. Txawm hais tias nws yog, ib yam nkaus, tias nws lub taub hau raug chais, nws lub hauv pliaj tau rub tawm hauv kev ywj pheej thiab ci ntsa iab, thiab zoo li nthuav dav dua li qhov nws xav tau, qhov no kuv yuav tsis txiav txim siab; tab sis paub tseeb tias nws lub taub hau yog phrenologically ib qho zoo heev. Tej zaum nws yuav zoo li tsis txaus ntseeg, tab sis nws ua rau kuv nco txog General Washington lub taub hau, raws li pom nyob rau hauv qhov nrov busts ntawm nws. Nws muaj tib qhov ntev tsis tu ncua graded retreating txoj kab nqes los saum toj no lub brows, uas kuj zoo li projecting, zoo li ob ntev promontories thickly wooded rau saum. Queequeg yog George Washington cannibalistically tsim.
    </p>
    <p>
       Txawm tias kuv tau ua tib zoo txheeb xyuas nws, ib nrab ua piv txwv tib lub sijhawm los saib cov cua daj cua dub los ntawm qhov xwm txheej, nws yeej tsis mloog kuv lub xub ntiag, yeej tsis muaj teeb meem rau nws tus kheej li ib pliag; tab sis tau tshwm sim tag nrho nrog suav cov nplooj ntawv ntawm cov ntawv zoo kawg nkaus. Xav txog tias peb tau pw tsaug zog ua ke li cas hmo dhau los, thiab tshwj xeeb tshaj yog xav txog txoj kev hlub uas kuv pom tau muab pov rau kuv thaum sawv ntxov, kuv xav tias qhov kev tsis txaus siab ntawm nws qhov txawv txawv heev. Tab sis savages yog coj txawv txawv; lub sij hawm koj tsis paub xyov yuav coj lawv li cas. Thaum xub thawj lawv yog overawing; lawv lub siab tus kheej sau ntawm simplicity zoo li Socratic kev txawj ntse. Kuv kuj tau pom tias Queequeg yeej tsis tau sib koom ua ke txhua, lossis tab sis tsawg heev, nrog rau lwm tus seamen hauv tsev so. Nws tsis ua ib qho kev nce qib; tshwm sim tsis muaj lub siab xav ua kom lub voj voog ntawm nws cov neeg paub. Tag nrho cov no tau ntaus kuv zoo li cov lus muaj zog; Txawm li cas los xij, raws li qhov kev xav thib ob, muaj qee yam yuav luag zoo nyob hauv nws. Ntawm no yog ib tug txiv neej li nees nkaum txhiab mais ntawm tsev, los ntawm txoj kev ntawm Cape Horn, uas yog - uas yog tib txoj kev uas nws yuav mus txog qhov ntawd - muab pov rau hauv cov neeg txawv txawv rau nws zoo li nws nyob hauv lub ntiaj teb Jupiter; thiab tseem nws zoo nkaus li nws yooj yim kiag li; khaws cia siab tshaj plaws; txaus siab nrog nws tus kheej kev phooj ywg; ib txwm sib npaug rau nws tus kheej. Muaj tseeb qhov no yog qhov kov ntawm lub tswv yim zoo; txawm tsis ntseeg nws yeej tsis tau hnov ​​muaj ib yam li ntawd. Tab sis, tej zaum, los ua cov neeg txawj ntse tiag tiag, peb cov neeg hauv ntiaj teb yuav tsum tsis txhob hnov ​​​​qab txog kev ua neej nyob lossis kev siv zog. Sai li sai tau raws li kuv hnov ​​​​tias tus txiv neej zoo li no muab nws tus kheej tawm rau tus kws tshawb fawb, kuv xaus lus tias, zoo li tus poj niam laus dyspeptic, nws yuav tsum tau &quot;tawg nws lub plab.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Raws li kuv zaum nyob rau hauv uas tam sim no kho siab chav; hluav taws kub hnyiab, nyob rau hauv lub me me theem thaum, tom qab nws thawj zaug siv tau sov huab cua, ces tsuas glows yuav saib; yav tsaus ntuj ntxoov thiab phantoms sib sau ua ke nyob ib ncig ntawm lub casements, thiab peering nyob rau hauv peb nyob ntsiag to, nyob ib leeg twain; cua daj cua dub booming tsis nyob rau hauv solemn swells; Kuv pib paub txog kev xav txawv txawv. Kuv hnov ​​ib tug yaj nyob rau hauv kuv. Tsis muaj ntxiv lawm kuv lub siab tawg thiab maddened tes tau tig tawm tsam lub ntiaj teb wolfish. Qhov kev nyuaj siab no tau txhiv nws. Nyob rau ntawd nws zaum, nws indifference heev hais lus ib tug xwm nyob rau hauv uas muaj lurked tsis civilized hypocrisies thiab bland deceits. Wild nws yog; qhov pom kev pom zoo heev; tsis tau kuv pib xav tias kuv tus kheej mysteriously kos rau ntawm nws. Thiab cov tib yam uas yuav muaj repelled lwm tus neeg feem ntau, lawv yog cov hlau nplaum heev uas yog li rub kuv. Kuv mam li sim ib tug phooj ywg pagan, xav tias kuv, txij li thaum Christian kev siab zoo tau ua pov thawj tab sis hollow courtesy. Kuv rub kuv lub rooj zaum ze ntawm nws, thiab ua ib co phooj ywg thiab cov lus qhia, ua qhov zoo tshaj plaws los tham nrog nws lub sijhawm. Thaum xub thawj nws me ntsis pom cov kev nce qib no; tab sis tam sim no, raws li kuv hais txog nws lub tsev kho mob nag hmo, nws tau tawm mus nug kuv seb peb puas yuav rov qab los ua phooj ywg dua. kuv hais rau nws tias yog; qhov twg kuv xav tias nws zoo siab, tej zaum ib tug me ntsis qhuas.
    </p>
    <p>
       Peb mam li tig phau ntawv ua ke, thiab kuv sim piav qhia rau nws lub hom phiaj ntawm kev luam ntawv, thiab lub ntsiab lus ntawm ob peb daim duab uas nyob hauv nws. Yog li tsis ntev kuv tau koom nrog nws txoj kev txaus siab; thiab los ntawm qhov ntawd peb tau mus rau jabbering qhov zoo tshaj plaws peb tuaj yeem hais txog ntau qhov chaw sab nrauv kom pom hauv lub nroog nto moo no. Tsis ntev kuv tau thov kev haus luam yeeb; thiab, tsim nws lub hnab thiab tomahawk, nws ntsiag to muab kuv lub puff. Thiab tom qab ntawd peb zaum sib pauv puffs los ntawm cov yeeb nkab qus ntawm nws, thiab ua kom nws tsis tu ncua ntawm peb.
    </p>
    <p>
       Yog tias tseem muaj cov dej khov ntawm kev tsis saib xyuas rau kuv hauv Pagan lub mis, cov pa luam yeeb zoo nkauj no peb muaj, tsis ntev thawed nws tawm, thiab tso peb cov neeg phem. Nws zoo nkaus li coj mus rau kuv heev li ib txwm thiab unbiddenly li kuv rau nws; thiab thaum peb cov pa luam yeeb dhau lawm, nws tau nplawm nws lub hauv pliaj tawm tsam kuv, npuaj kuv puag ncig lub duav, thiab hais tias txij no mus peb yuav tau sib yuav; lub ntsiab lus, nyob rau hauv nws lub teb chaws cov kab lus, hais tias peb bosom phooj ywg; nws yuav zoo siab tuag rau kuv, yog tias xav tau. Nyob rau hauv ib tug neeg txawv teb chaws, tam sim no nplaim taws ntawm kev phooj ywg yuav zoo li deb dhau ntxov ntxov, ib yam uas yuav tsis ntseeg ntau; tab sis nyob rau hauv no yooj yim savage cov kev cai qub yuav tsis siv.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tom qab noj hmo, thiab lwm yam kev sib tham thiab haus luam yeeb, peb mus rau hauv peb chav ua ke. Nws muab kuv ib tug khoom plig ntawm nws lub taub hau embalmed; rho tawm nws lub hnab nyiaj luam yeeb loj, thiab groping hauv qab cov luam yeeb, kos tawm ib co peb caug nyiaj hauv nyiaj; tom qab ntawd muab lawv tso rau ntawm lub rooj, thiab muab faib ua ob feem sib npaug, thawb ib qho ntawm lawv rau kuv, thiab hais tias nws yog kuv li. Kuv yuav rov qhia dua; tab sis nws ua rau kuv ntsiag to los ntawm kev nchuav lawv rau hauv kuv lub hnab ris. kuv cia lawv nyob. Tom qab ntawd nws mus txog nws cov lus thov yav tsaus ntuj, tshem nws tus mlom, thiab tshem tawm daim ntawv foob. Los ntawm qee yam cim thiab cov tsos mob, kuv xav tias nws zoo li ntxhov siab rau kuv koom nrog nws; tab sis paub zoo tias yuav ua raws li cas, kuv tau txiav txim siab ib pliag seb, yog tias nws caw kuv, kuv yuav ua raws lossis lwm yam.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kuv yog ib tug ntseeg zoo; yug thiab yug nyob rau hauv lub bosom ntawm lub infallible Presbyterian lub Koom Txoos. Yuav ua li cas kuv tuaj yeem koom nrog tus pe mlom qus no hauv kev pe hawm nws daim ntoo? Tiamsis kev pehawm Vajtswv yog dabtsi? xav txog kuv. Koj puas xav tias tam sim no, Ixama-ees, tus Vajtswv uas muaj hwjchim loj kawg nkaus saum ntuj ceeb tsheej thiab lub ntiaj teb—pagans thiab tag nrho cov uas suav nrog—tej zaum muaj peev xwm khib siab ntawm cov ntoo dub me ntsis? Ua tsis tau! Tiamsis kev pe hawm dabtsi yog dabtsi?—kom ua raws li Vajtswv lub siab nyiam— 
      <i>
        uas
      </i>
       yog pe hawm. Thiab Vajtswv lub siab nyiam ua li cas?—ua li cas rau kuv cov kwv tij tej yam uas kuv xav kom kuv cov kwv tij ua rau kuv— 
      <i>
        uas
      </i>
       yog Vajtswv lub siab nyiam. Tam sim no, Queequeg yog kuv tus khub. Thiab kuv xav tias qhov Queequeg yuav ua li cas rau kuv? Vim li cas, koom nrog kuv hauv kuv qhov kev pehawm Presbyterian tshwj xeeb. Yog li ntawd, kuv yuav tsum koom nrog nws hauv nws; Yog lawm, kuv yuav tsum tig tus mlom. Yog li ntawd kuv thiaj li ua cov shavings; pab txhawb nqa tus mlom me me dawb huv; muab nws hlawv biscuit nrog Queequeg; salamed ua ntej nws ob zaug los yog peb zaug; hnia nws lub qhov ntswg; thiab ua li ntawd, peb tau hnav khaub ncaws thiab mus pw, ntawm kev thaj yeeb nrog peb tus kheej lub siab thiab tag nrho lub ntiaj teb no. Tab sis peb tsis mus pw tsis muaj ib co me ntsis tham.
    </p>
    <p>
       Cas kuv tsis paub; tab sis tsis muaj ib qho chaw zoo li lub txaj rau kev qhia tsis pub lwm tus paub ntawm cov phooj ywg. Txiv neej thiab poj niam, lawv hais tias, muaj qhib lub hauv qab ntawm lawv tus ntsuj plig rau ib leeg; thiab qee cov niam txiv laus feem ntau dag thiab sib tham dua qub txog thaum sawv ntxov. Yog li, tom qab ntawd, hauv peb lub siab lub siab nyiam, nteg kuv thiab Queequeg—ib khub sib hlub.

       Peb tau pw li no hauv txaj, sib tham thiab pw tsaug zog ntawm lub sijhawm luv luv, thiab Queequeg tam sim no thiab tom qab ntawd muab pov rau nws cov xim av tattooed ob txhais ceg hla kuv, thiab tom qab ntawd rub lawv rov qab; yog li ntawd tag nrho sociable thiab dawb thiab yooj yim yog peb; Thaum, thaum kawg, los ntawm vim li cas ntawm peb qhov kev sib cav, dab tsi me me nappishness tseem nyob hauv peb tag nrho tau ncaim mus, thiab peb xav tias zoo li sawv rov qab los, txawm tias hnub so tseem nyob rau yav tom ntej.
    </p>
    <p>
       Yog lawm, peb tau sawv los heev; ntau npaum li ntawd tias peb txoj hauj lwm recumbent pib loj hlob tuaj, thiab los ntawm me me thiab me me peb pom peb tus kheej zaum; cov khaub ncaws zoo nyob ib ncig ntawm peb, ntswj lub taub hau nrog peb plaub lub hauv caug rub los ze ua ke, thiab peb ob lub qhov ntswg khoov rau lawv, zoo li peb lub hauv caug sov-yias.

       Peb tau zaum hauv qhov crouching no ib pliag, thaum tag nrho ib zaug kuv xav tias kuv yuav qhib kuv lub qhov muag; rau thaum nruab nrab ntawm nplooj ntawv, txawm nyob rau nruab hnub lossis hmo ntuj, thiab txawm tias pw tsaug zog lossis tsaug zog, kuv muaj txoj hauv kev los ua kom kuv ob lub qhov muag kaw, txhawm rau kom mloog ntau dua rau kev pw tsaug zog.

       QHOV 12. Biography.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Queequeg yog ib haiv neeg ntawm Rokovoko, ib kob nyob deb mus rau sab hnub poob thiab sab qab teb. Nws tsis nyob hauv ib daim ntawv qhia; qhov tseeb yeej tsis muaj.
    </p>
    <p>
       Thaum ib tug tshiab-hatched savage khiav qus ntawm nws haiv neeg hav zoov nyob rau hauv ib tug nyom clout, ua raws li los ntawm cov tshis nibbling, zoo li nws yog ib tug ntsuab sapling; txawm li ntawd los, hauv Queequeg lub siab xav tau, lurked muaj lub siab xav pom ib yam dab tsi ntau ntawm Christendom dua li tus qauv whaler lossis ob. Nws txiv yog ib tug Thawj Coj, yog Vajntxwv; nws txiv ntxawm yog Pov Thawj Hwj; thiab ntawm leej niam nws tau khav theeb cov phauj uas yog cov poj niam ntawm cov tub rog uas tsis muaj yeej. Muaj cov ntshav zoo heev hauv nws cov leeg-cov khoom vaj ntxwv; txawm tias tu siab heev, kuv ntshai, los ntawm qhov kev xav ntawm cannibal nws txhawb nqa nws cov hluas uas tsis muaj kev qhia.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lub nkoj Sag Harbor tau mus xyuas nws txiv lub bay, thiab Queequeg nrhiav ib txoj kev mus rau cov ntseeg Vajtswv. Tab sis lub nkoj, muaj nws tag nrho ntxiv ntawm seamen, spurned nws ce; thiab tsis yog txhua tus Vaj Ntxwv nws txiv lub hwj chim yuav yeej. Tab sis Queequeg tau cog lus tseg. Ib leeg hauv nws lub nkoj, nws tau paddled mus rau qhov chaw deb, uas nws paub tias lub nkoj yuav tsum hla thaum nws tawm ntawm cov kob. Ntawm ib sab yog coral reef; Nyob rau lwm qhov ntawm thaj av qis, npog nrog mangrove thickets uas loj hlob tawm mus rau hauv dej. nkaum nws lub nkoj, tseem nteg, ntawm cov thickets, nrog nws prow seaward, nws zaum nyob rau hauv lub stern, paddle qis ntawm tes; thiab thaum lub nkoj tab tom gliding, zoo li lub teeb nws darted; tau txais nws sab; nrog ib tug rov qab khiav ceev ntawm nws ko taw capsized thiab ntog nws canoe; nce li ntawm chains; thiab muab nws tus kheej tag nrho ntev rau ntawm lub lawj, tuav lub nplhaib-ntswj nyob rau ntawd, thiab cog lus tias yuav tsis tso nws mus, txawm tias hacked hauv daim.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nyob rau hauv vain tus thawj coj hem tias yuav muab pov nws overboard; tshem tawm ib lub cutlass hla nws dab teg liab qab; Queequeg yog tus tub ntawm Vajntxwv, thiab Queequeg tsis tau mus. Ua tsaug rau nws txoj kev xav tsis thoob, thiab nws lub siab xav mus xyuas Christendom, tus thawj coj thaum kawg tau tso siab, thiab hais rau nws tias nws tuaj yeem ua nws tus kheej hauv tsev. Tab sis tus tub hluas no zoo kawg nkaus - lub hiav txwv Tub Vaj Ntxwv ntawm Wales, tsis tau pom tus Thawj Tub Ceev Xwm lub tsev. Lawv muab nws tso rau hauv cov neeg tsav nkoj, thiab ua ib tug whaleman ntawm nws. Tab sis zoo li Czar Peter cov ntsiab lus rau kev ua haujlwm hauv lub nkoj ntawm cov nroog txawv teb chaws, Queequeg tsis pom zoo tsis muaj qhov tsis zoo, yog tias yog li ntawd nws yuav zoo siab tau txais lub hwj chim ntawm kev ua kom pom tseeb rau nws cov neeg tsis paub lus. Rau hauv qab-yog li nws hais rau kuv-nws tau ua tiav los ntawm kev muaj siab xav kawm ntawm cov ntseeg, cov txuj ci uas ua rau nws cov neeg tseem muaj kev zoo siab dua lawv; thiab tshaj qhov ntawd, tseem zoo dua lawv. Tab sis, alas! cov kev coj ntawm whalemen sai sai no ntxias nws tias txawm cov ntseeg yuav ua tau ob qho tib si txom nyem thiab phem; infinitely ntau li ntawd, dua li tag nrho nws txiv cov heathens. Tuaj txog thaum kawg hauv Sag Harbor qub; thiab pom tej uas cov neeg tsav nkoj tau ua nyob ntawd; thiab tom qab ntawd mus rau Nantucket, thiab pom tias lawv tau siv lawv cov nyiaj ua haujlwm li cas hauv qhov chaw 
      <i>
        ntawd
      </i>
       , cov neeg pluag Queequeg tau muab nws poob rau. Xav tias nws, nws yog lub ntiaj teb phem nyob rau hauv tag nrho cov meridians; Kuv yuav tuag pagan.

    <p>
       Thiab yog li ntawd ib tug qub mlom ntawm lub siab, nws tseem nyob nrog cov ntseeg no, hnav lawv cov khaub ncaws, thiab sim tham lawv gibberish. Li no cov queer txoj kev txog nws, tab sis tam sim no qee lub sij hawm los ntawm tsev.
    </p>
    <p>
       Los ntawm cov lus qhia, kuv nug nws seb nws puas tsis tau rov qab los, thiab muaj kev ua koob tsheej; txij li tam sim no nws yuav xav tias nws txiv tuag thiab ploj mus, nws laus heev thiab tsis muaj zog thaum kawg. Nws teb tsis tau, tseem tsis tau; thiab hais ntxiv tias nws yog cov ntseeg uas ntshai cov ntseeg, lossis cov ntseeg uas tsis tsim nyog rau nws nce mus rau lub zwm txwv dawb huv thiab tsis huv ntawm peb caug tus Vaj Ntxwv Pagan ua ntej nws. Tab sis los ntawm thiab los ntawm, nws hais tias, nws yuav rov qab los,﻿—thaum nws hnov ​​nws tus kheej ua kev cai raus dej dua. Txawm li cas los xij, rau qhov tsis yog, nws tau hais kom caij nkoj mus, thiab sow nws cov oats qus hauv tag nrho plaub dej hiav txwv. Lawv tau ua ib tug harpooneer ntawm nws, thiab lub barbed hlau yog nyob rau hauv lieu ntawm ib tug scepter tam sim no.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kuv nug nws tias qhov twg yuav yog nws lub hom phiaj tam sim ntawd, kov nws txoj kev txav mus tom ntej. Nws teb tias, mus rau hiav txwv dua, hauv nws txoj haujlwm qub. Raws li qhov no, kuv tau hais rau nws tias whaling yog kuv tus kheej tsim, thiab qhia nws txog kuv lub hom phiaj kom caij nkoj tawm ntawm Nantucket, uas yog qhov chaw nres nkoj pheej hmoo tshaj plaws rau tus neeg taug txuj kev nyuaj whaleman pib los ntawm. Nws tam sim ntawd txiav txim siab nrog kuv mus rau lub koog pov txwv ntawd, nkoj hauv tib lub nkoj, nkag mus rau hauv tib lub saib, tib lub nkoj, tib qhov kev ntxhov siab nrog kuv, luv luv los qhia kuv txhua qhov kev ntxhov siab; nrog kuv ob txhais tes nyob rau hauv nws, ua siab loj mus rau hauv lub Potluck ntawm ob lub ntiaj teb no. Rau txhua yam no kuv zoo siab txais tos; rau ntxiv rau qhov kev hlub uas kuv tam sim no muaj rau Queequeg, nws yog ib tus neeg paub txog kev sib tw, thiab yog li ntawd, tsis tuaj yeem ua tsis tau zoo rau ib tus neeg, uas, zoo li kuv, tsis quav ntsej txog kev paub tsis meej ntawm whaling, txawm tias paub zoo nrog cov hiav txwv, raws li paub rau tub lag luam seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nws zaj dab neeg tau xaus nrog nws cov yeeb nkab qhov kawg tuag puff, Queequeg puag kuv, nias nws lub hauv pliaj tawm tsam kuv, thiab tshuab tawm lub teeb, peb dov ntawm ib leeg, txoj kev no thiab qhov ntawd, thiab sai sai tau tsaug zog.

    <p>
       Tau txais cov dej qhib ntau, lub bracing breeze waxed tshiab; Tus me Moss pov lub npuas nrawm ntawm nws hneev, zoo li tus menyuam mos liab nws snortings. Cas kuv snuffed lub Tartar huab cua!—Kuv ua li cas kuv ntsoos lub ntiaj teb turnpike!—txoj kev loj uas nyob ib ncig ntawm dented nrog cov cim ntawm qhev pob taws thiab hoofs; thiab tig kuv mus qhuas lub hiav txwv magnanimity uas yuav tso cai tsis muaj ntaub ntawv.

    <p>
       Ntawm tib lub npuas dej, Queequeg zoo li haus thiab rov qab nrog kuv. Nws lub qhov ntswg dusky swells sib nrug; nws qhia nws cov ntaub ntawv thiab taw cov hniav. Ntawm, ntawm peb ya; thiab peb qhov kev txiav txim tau txais, Moss tau pe hawm lub moj tej tawg; ducked thiab dived nws hneev raws li ib tug qhev ua ntej lub Sultan. Sideways leaning, peb sideways darted; txhua ropeyarn tingling zoo li ib tug hlau; ob lub siab masts buckling zoo li Indian canes nyob rau hauv av tornadoes. Yog li ntawd tag nrho ntawm qhov reeling scene yog peb, thaum peb sawv ntawm lub plunging bowsprit, hais tias rau ib txhia lub sij hawm peb tsis tau pom lub jeering glances ntawm cov neeg caij tsheb, ib lub rooj sib txoos zoo li lubber, uas xav tsis thoob tias ob tug kwv tij yuav tsum sib koom ua ke; zoo li ib tug txiv neej dawb yog dab tsi muaj meej mom tshaj li tus neeg dawb huv negro. Tab sis muaj ib co boobies thiab bumpkins nyob rau ntawd, uas, los ntawm lawv mob siab heev ntsuabness, yuav tsum tau los ntawm lub plawv thiab nruab nrab ntawm tag nrho cov verdure. Queequeg ntes tau ib tug ntawm cov tub ntxhais hluas saplings mimicking nws qab nws nraub qaum. Kuv xav tias lub sij hawm ntawm kev puas tsuaj tau los. Tso nws tus harpoon, tus neeg siab phem siab phem ntes nws hauv nws txhais tes, thiab los ntawm kev ua txuj ci tseem ceeb thiab lub zog yuav luag, xa nws lub cev mus rau saum huab cua; Tom qab ntawd me ntsis tapping nws stern nyob rau hauv nruab nrab-somerset, tus khub tsaws nrog bursting ntsws rau ntawm nws ob txhais taw, thaum Queequeg, tig rov qab rau nws, taws nws tomahawk yeeb nkab thiab hla nws rau kuv rau puff.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Kev ntes! Capting!” qw nrov nrov, khiav mus rau tus tub ceev xwm; &quot;Capting, Capting, ntawm no yog dab ntxwg nyoog.&quot;

       &quot;Nyob zoo, 
      <i>
        koj

       tus tswv,&quot; Tus tauj ncov loj, ib tug gaunt tav tav ntawm lub hiav txwv, stalking mus rau Queequeg, &quot;dab tsi koj txhais li cas los ntawm qhov ntawd? Koj tsis paub tias tej zaum koj yuav tua tau tus dab ntawd?
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Nws hais li cas?&quot; hais Queequeg, raws li nws maj mam tig los rau kuv.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Nws hais tias,&quot;Kuv hais tias, &quot;koj tuaj ze tua-e tus txiv neej ntawd,&quot; taw rau tus tseem tshee tshee.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Tua-e,&quot; quaj Queequeg, ntswj nws lub ntsej muag tattoo rau hauv qhov tsis txaus ntseeg ntawm kev thuam, &quot;ah! nws bevy me-e ntses-e; Queequeg tsis tua-e li me-e ntses-e; Queequeg tua-e loj whale!”
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Saib koj,&quot; Tus tauj ncov loj, &quot;Kuv mam li tua 
      <i>
        koj
      </i>
       , koj cannibal, yog tias koj sim lwm yam ntawm koj tricks nyob rau ntawm no; nco ntsoov koj lub qhov muag. &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Tab sis nws tshwm sim li ntawd, hais tias nws yog lub sij hawm siab rau tus tauj ncov loj ntawm nws lub qhov muag. Cov kab mob loj heev rau ntawm lub ntsiab-sail tau faib cov huab cua-daim ntawv, thiab tam sim no lub boom loj heev tau ya los ntawm ib sab mus rau sab, cheb tag nrho tom qab ib feem ntawm lub lawj. Cov neeg pluag uas Queequeg tau ua phem heev, raug cheb hla lub nkoj; tag nrho txhais tes nyob rau hauv ib tug ceeb; thiab sim snatching ntawm boom kom nyob nws, zoo li npau taws. Nws ya los ntawm sab xis mus rau sab laug, thiab rov qab dua, yuav luag hauv ib qho zuam ntawm lub moos, thiab txhua qhov tam sim ntawd zoo li ntawm qhov taw tes ntawm snapping rau hauv splinters. Tsis muaj dab tsi ua tiav, thiab tsis muaj dab tsi zoo li muaj peev xwm ua tiav; cov neeg nyob rau hauv lawj rushed mus rau lub hneev, thiab sawv eyeing lub boom zoo li nws yog lub puab tsaig sab ntawm ib tug exasperated whale. Nyob rau hauv nruab nrab ntawm qhov kev ntxhov siab no, Queequeg poob qis rau nws lub hauv caug, thiab nkag mus rau hauv txoj kev ntawm lub boom, nplawm ntawm txoj hlua, tuav ib kawg rau lub bulwarks, thiab tom qab ntawd flinging lwm yam zoo li ib tug lasso, ntes nws puag ncig lub boom. raws li nws swept hla nws lub taub hau, thiab nyob rau tom ntej no jerk, lub spar yog txoj kev ntawd daig, thiab tag nrho cov nyob nyab xeeb. Tus schooner tau khiav mus rau hauv cua, thiab thaum ob txhais tes tab tom tshem lub nkoj stern, Queequeg, stripped rau lub duav, darted los ntawm sab nrog ib tug ntev nyob arc ntawm leap. Rau peb feeb lossis ntau dua nws tau pom ua luam dej zoo li aub, ntuav nws txhais tes ntev ncaj tawm ntawm nws xub ntiag, thiab los ntawm kev tig nws lub xub pwg nyom los ntawm cov npuas dej khov. Kuv ntsia tus poj niam loj thiab muaj koob meej, tiam sis pom tsis muaj leej twg yuav dim. Lub greenhorn tau ploj mus. Tua nws tus kheej perpendicularly los ntawm dej, Queequeg, tam sim no coj ib qho tam sim ntawd saib ib ncig ntawm nws, thiab zoo li pom tias muaj teeb meem li cas, dhia thiab ploj mus. Ob peb feeb ntxiv, thiab nws sawv rov los, ib sab caj npab tseem tawm tsam, thiab nrog rau lwm tus rub daim ntawv tsis muaj sia. Lub nkoj sai sai tuaj tos lawv. Cov neeg pluag pluag tau rov qab los. Txhua txhais tes tau pov npav Queequeg ib tug nom tswv trump; tus thawj coj thov nws zam txim. Txij lub sij hawm ntawd kuv clove mus rau Queequeg zoo li ib tug barnacle; muaj tseeb tiag, txog thaum tus neeg pluag Queequeg tau siv nws qhov kev dhia dej ntev kawg.
    </p>
    <p>
       Puas muaj qhov tsis nco qab li ntawd? Nws tsis zoo li xav tias nws tau txais txiaj ntsig los ntawm Humane thiab Magnanimous Societies. Nws tsuas thov dej—dej tshiab—ib yam dab tsi los so cov brine; Ua li ntawd, nws hnav khaub ncaws qhuav, teeb nws lub raj, thiab ntsoos ntawm lub bulwarks, thiab maj mam pom cov neeg nyob ib puag ncig nws, zoo li tau hais rau nws tus kheej—“Nws yog kev sib nrig sib koom tes hauv ntiaj teb, hauv txhua qhov meridians. Peb cov neeg cannibals yuav tsum pab cov ntseeg no. &quot;

       QHOV 14. Nantucket.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Tsis muaj ib yam dab tsi ntxiv tshwm sim nyob rau hauv nqe lus tsim nyog tau hais; yog li ntawd, tom qab kev khiav zoo, peb tuaj txog hauv Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nantucket! Tshem tawm koj daim ntawv qhia thiab saib nws. Saib seb lub ces kaum tiag tiag ntawm lub ntiaj teb nws nyob; Yuav ua li cas nws nyob ntawd, deb ntawm ntug dej, kho siab tshaj li Eddystone lighthouse. Saib ntawm nws - ib tug mere hillock, thiab luj tshib ntawm xuab zeb; tag nrho lub puam, tsis muaj keeb kwm yav dhau. Muaj cov xuab zeb ntau dua li koj yuav siv nees nkaum xyoo los hloov daim ntawv blotting. Qee qhov gamesome wights yuav qhia rau koj tias lawv yuav tsum cog cov nroj tsuag muaj, lawv tsis loj hlob ib txwm; hais tias lawv import Canada thistles; hais tias lawv yuav tsum xa mus dhau hiav txwv rau ib tug ntxwj nyoog kom tsis txhob muaj ib tug xau nyob rau hauv ib lub hub roj; hais tias tej daim ntoo hauv Nantucket tau nqa zoo li cov khoom ntawm tus ntoo khaub lig tseeb hauv Rome; hais tias cov neeg nyob ntawd cog toadstools ua ntej lawv lub tsev, kom tau nyob rau hauv qhov ntxoov ntxoo nyob rau lub caij ntuj sov; hais tias ib tug hniav ntawm nyom ua ib tug oasis, peb hniav nyob rau hauv ib hnub taug kev prairie; tias lawv hnav cov khau nrawm, qee yam zoo li Laplander khau khau; hais tias lawv tau kaw, belted txog, txhua txoj hauv kev kaw, ib puag ncig, thiab ua ib qho utter Island ntawm dej hiav txwv, hais tias mus rau lawv cov rooj zaum thiab rooj me me clams tej zaum yuav pom adhering, xws li lub nraub qaum ntawm hiav txwv vaub kib. Tab sis cov extravaganzas tsuas yog qhia tias Nantucket tsis yog Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
       Saib tam sim no nyob rau hauv zaj dab neeg zoo kawg nkaus ntawm cov kob no li cas los ntawm cov txiv neej liab. Yog li mus rau zaj dab neeg. Nyob rau hauv ancient sij hawm ib tug dav dawb hau swooped rau ntawm New England ntug dej hiav txwv, thiab nqa tawm ib tug me nyuam mos Indian nyob rau hauv nws talons. Nrog lub suab quaj nrov, cov niam txiv pom lawv tus menyuam yug los ntawm qhov pom ntawm ntug dej dav. Lawv txiav txim siab ua raws li tib txoj kev. Nyob rau hauv lawv cov canoes, tom qab ib tug perilous passage lawv nrhiav tau lub kob, thiab nyob rau ntawd lawv nrhiav tau ib tug tas li ivory casket, - cov neeg pluag Indian lub cev pob txha.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dab tsi xav tsis thoob, yog li ntawd, cov Nantucketers, yug ntawm lub puam, yuav tsum coj mus rau hauv hiav txwv kom ua neej nyob! Lawv xub ntes tau crabs thiab quohogs hauv cov xuab zeb; loj hlob tuaj, lawv waded nrog nets rau mackerel; kev paub ntau dua, lawv thawb tawm hauv nkoj thiab ntes cod; thiab thaum kawg, tso lub nkoj loj ntawm cov nkoj loj hauv hiav txwv, tshawb txog lub ntiaj teb dej hiav txwv no; muab ib txoj siv tsis tu ncua ntawm circumnavigations puag ncig nws; peeped hauv Behring&#39;s Straits; thiab nyob rau hauv tag nrho cov caij nyoog thiab tag nrho cov dej hiav txwv tau tshaj tawm kev ua tsov ua rog nyob mus ib txhis nrog lub zog loj tshaj plaws animated pawg uas tau dim ntawm dej nyab; feem ntau monstrous thiab feem ntau roob! Hais tias Himmalehan, ntsev hiav txwv Mastodon, hnav nrog xws li portentousness ntawm lub hwj chim tsis nco qab, hais tias nws txaus ntshai heev yuav tsum tau dreaded tshaj nws feem ntau ntshai thiab phem ua phem!
    </p>
    <p>
       Thiab li no muaj cov liab qab Nantucketers, cov hiav txwv hermits, tawm ntawm lawv cov ntsaum toj nyob rau hauv hiav txwv, overrun thiab conquered lub ntiaj teb no dej zoo li ntau Alexanders; parcelling tawm ntawm lawv lub Atlantic, Pacific, thiab Indian dej hiav txwv, raws li peb pirate powers ua Poland. Cia America ntxiv Mexico rau Texas, thiab pawg Cuba rau Canada; cia cov lus Askiv overswarm tag nrho Is Nrias teb, thiab dai lawv blazing banner los ntawm lub hnub; ob feem peb ntawm lub ntiaj teb no terraqueous yog Nantucketer&#39;s. Rau qhov hiav txwv yog nws; nws muaj nws, raws li Emperors muaj empires; lwm cov seamen tab sis muaj txoj cai ntawm txoj kev los ntawm nws. Cov tub lag luam nkoj tab sis txuas txuas txuas ntxiv; riam phom tab sis ntab forts; Txawm tias cov pirates thiab cov neeg ntiag tug, txawm tias taug qab hiav txwv raws li txoj kev loj ntawm txoj kev, lawv tab tom nyiag lwm lub nkoj, lwm qhov tawg ntawm thaj av zoo li lawv tus kheej, tsis nrhiav kev kos lawv txoj sia los ntawm qhov tob tob nws tus kheej. Tus Nantucketer, nws ib leeg nyob thiab kev tawm tsam ntawm hiav txwv; nws ib leeg, hauv phau Vajlugkub, nqes mus rau hauv nkoj; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. 
      <i>
        There
      </i>
       is his home; 
      <i>
        there
      </i>
       lies his business, which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
