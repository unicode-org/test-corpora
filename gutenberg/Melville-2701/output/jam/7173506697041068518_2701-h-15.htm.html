<p>Yahso, now, two big whale deh, a lay dem head tugeda; mek wi join dem, an lay tugeda wi own.</p>
<p>Outa di grand order a folio leviathans, di Sperm Whale an di Right Whale a di most noteworthy. Dem a di ongl whale dem weh man regularly hunt. Tu di Nantucketer, dem present di two extremes a all di known varieties a di whale. As di external difference between dem is mainly observable inna dem head; an as a head a each is dis moment hanging fram di Pequod's side; an as we may freely go fram one to di ada, by merely stepping across di deck:—weh, mi shuda like fi know, yuh wi get a beta chance fi study practical cetology dan yah?</p>
<p>Inna di first place, yuh get struck by di general contrast between dem head yah. Both dem massive enough inna all conscience; but deh have a certain mathematical symmetry inna di Sperm Whale's weh di Right Whale's sadly lack. Deh have more character inna di Sperm Whale's head. As yuh behold it, yuh involuntarily yield di immense superiority to him, in point a pervading dignity. Inna di present instance, too, dis dignity is heightened by di pepper an salt color a him head at di summit, giving token a advanced age an large experience. In short, him a weh di fishermen dem technically call a “grey-headed whale.”</p>
<p>Mek wi note now weh di least dissimilar inna dem head yah—namely, di two most important organs, di eye an di ear. Far back pan di side a di head, an low dung, near di angle a either whale's jaw, if yuh narrowly search, yuh wi at last si a lashless eye, weh yuh woulda fancy fi be a young colt's eye; so out a all proportion is it to di magnitude a di head.</p>
<p>Now, fram dis peculiar sideway position a di whale's eyes, it is plain seh him can neva see an object weh deh exactly ahead, no more dan him can one exactly astern. Inna a word, di position a di whale's eyes correspond to dat a di man's ears; an yuh maita fancy, fi yuhself, how it woulda fare wid yuh, did yuh sideways survey objects chruu yuh ears. Yuh woulda find out seh yuh coulda only command some thirty degrees a vision in advance a di straight side-line a sight; an bout thirty more behind it. If yuh bitterest foe did a walk straight towards yuh, wid dagger uplifted inna broad day, yuh wouldn't be able fi see him, any more dan if him did a steal pan yuh fram behind. Inna a word, yuh woulda have two backs, so fi seh; but, at di same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): fi weh mek di front a one man—weh, indeed, but him eyes?</p>
<p>Moreover, while in most ada animals weh mi can tink bout now, di eyes dem so planted as imperceptibly fi blend dem visual power, so as fi produce one picture an not two to di brain; di peculiar position a di whale's eyes, effectually divided as dem deh by many cubic feet a solid head, weh towers between dem like a great mountain weh separate two lakes inna valleys; dis, a course, haffi wholly separate di impressions weh each independent organ imparts. Di whale, so, haffi see one distinct picture pan dis side, an anodda distinct picture pan dat deh side; while all between must be profound darkness an nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said fi look out pan di worl fram a sentry-box wid two joined sashes fi him window. But wid di whale, dem two sashes deh separately insert, mek two distinct windows, but sadly impairing di view. Dis peculiarity a di whale's eyes a one ting weh always fi be borne inna mind inna di fishery; an fi be memba by di reader inna some subsequent scenes.</p>
<p>A curious an most puzzling question might be staat concerning dis visual matter as touching di Leviathan. But mi haffi be content wid a hint. So long as a man's eyes dem open inna di light, di act a seeing is involuntary; dat mean, him cyaan den help mechanically see whatever objects deh before him. Nevertheless, any one's experience will teach him, dat though him can tek in an undiscriminating sweep of tings at one glance, it is quite impossible fi him, attentively, an completely, fi examine any two tings—however big or however small—at one an di same instant a time; neva mind if dem lie side by side an touch each ada. But if yuh now come fi separate dem two object yah, an surround each by a circle a profound darkness; den, fi si one a dem, in such a manner as fi bring yuh mind fi bear pan it, di ada one ago be utterly excluded fram yuh contemporary consciousness. How it go, den, wid di whale? True, both him eyes, inna demself, haffi act simultaneously; but is him brain so much more comprehensive, combining, an subtle dan man's, dat him can at di same moment a time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one pan one side a him, an di ada one inna an exactly opposite direction? If him can, den is it as marvelous a ting inna him, as if a man did able simultaneously fi go chuu di demonstrations a two distinct problems inna Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any incongruity inna dis comparison.</p>
<p>It may be but an idle whim, but it always seem to mi, dat di extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales wen dem beset by three or four boats; di timidity an liability to queer frights, so common to such whales; Mi tink seh all dis indirectly proceed fram di helpless perplexity a volition, in which dem divided an diametrically opposite powers a vision haffi involve dem.</p>
<p>But di ear a di whale full as curious as di eye. If yuh a one entire stranger to dem race, yuh might hunt ova dem two head deh fi hours, an neva discover dat deh organ. Di ear nuh have no external leaf whatever; an inna di hole itself yuh can hardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it. It lodge a likkle behind di eye. Wid respect to dem ears, dis important difference is fi be observed between di sperm whale an di right. While di ear a di fos wan have an external opening, dat a di latta is entirely an evenly cover ova wid a membrane, so as fi be quite imperceptible fram widout.</p>
<p>It no curious, dat so big a being as di whale shuda see di worl chruu so likl an eye, an hear di thunder chruu wan ear weh smaala dan a hare's? But if him eyes dem did broad as di lens a Herschel's great telescope; an him ears capacious as di porches a cathedrals; dat woulda mek him no longer of sight, or sharper of hear? Not at all.—Why den yuh try fi “enlarge” yuh mind? Subtilize it.</p>
<p>Mek wi now wid whatever levers an steam-engines we have at hand, cant ova di sperm whale's head, dat it may lie bottom up; den, ascending by a ladder to di summit, have a peep dung di mout; an if it neva seh di body now completely separate fram it, wid a lantern we might descend inna di great Kentucky Mammoth Cave a him stomach. But mek wi hold on yah by dis tooth, an look bout wi weh wi deh. Wat a really beautiful an chaste-looking mouth! fram floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered wid a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.</p>
<p>But come out now, an look pon dis portentous lower jaw, weh look like di long narrow lid a one immense snuff-box, wid di hinge at one end, instead a one side. If yuh pry it up, so as fi get it ovahead, an expose it rows a teet, it look like a terrific portcullis; an such, alas! it prove to many a poor wight inna di fishery, upon whom dem spikes fall wid impaling force. But far more terrible is it fi behold, wen fathoms dung inna di sea, yuh see some sulky whale, floating deh suspended, wid him prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging straight dung at right-angles wid him body, fi all di worl like a ship's jib-boom. Dis whale nuh dead; him only dispirited; out a sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; an so supine, dat di hinges a him jaw relax, lef him deh inna dat deh ungainly sort a plight, a reproach to all him tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.</p>
<p>Inna most cases dis lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practiced artist—is disengaged an hoisted pan deck fi di purpose a extract di ivory teet dem, an furnishing a supply a dat deh hard white whalebone wid weh di fisherman dem fashion all sorts a curious articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, an hand-whipding to whipding.</p>
<p>Wid a long, weary hoist di jaw get drag pan board, as if it was an anchor; an wen di proper time come—some few days afta di ada work—Queequeg, Daggoo, an Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists, dem set fi draw teet. Wid a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances di gums; den di jaw get lash dung to ringbolts, an a tackle get rigged fram aloft, dem drag out dem teet deh, as Michigan oxen drag stumps a old oaks outa wild wood lands. Deh generally have forty-two teet inna all; inna old whales, much worn dung, but undecayed; nor filled afta wi artificial fashion. Di jaw dem aftawards sawn inna slabs, an pile weh like joists fi build houses.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00080">CHAPTER 75. Di Right Whale's Head—Contrasted View.</h2>
<p>Crossing di deck, mek wi now have a good long look pon di Right Whale's head.</p>
<p>As in general shape di noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared to a Roman war-chariot (especially in front, weh it so broadly rounded); so, at a broad view, di Right Whale's head bear a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago one old Dutch voyager did like it shape to dat a one shoemaker's last. An inna dis same last or shoe, dat deh old woman a di nursery tale, wid di swarming brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she an all har progeny.</p>
<p>But as yuh come nearer to dis great head it staat fi assume different aspects, according to yuh point a view. If yuh stan op pan it summit an look pon dem two F-shaped spoutholes yah, yuh woulda tek di whole head fi an enormous bass-viol, an dem spiracles yah, di apertures inna it sounding-board. Den, again, if yuh fix yuh eye pan dis strange, crested, comb-like incrustation pan di top a di mass—dis green, barnacled ting, weh di Greenlanders dem call di “crown,” an di Southern fishers dem di “bonnet” a di Right Whale; fixing yuh eyes solely pan dis, yuh woulda tek di head fi di trunk a some huge oak, wid a bird's nest inna it crotch. At any rate, wen yuh watch dem live crabs deh weh nestle yah pan dis bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure fi occur to yuh; unless, indeed, yuh fancy get fix by di technical term “crown” weh dem gi it tu; in which case yuh wi tek great interest inna tinkin how dis mighty monster is actually a diademed king of di sea, whose green crown have put together fi him inna dis marvelous manner. But if dis whale a king, him a one very sulky looking fellow fi grace a diadem. Look pon dat deh hanging lower lip! wat a huge sulk an pout deh deh! a sulk an pout, by carpenter's measurement, bout twenty feet long an five feet deep; a sulk an pout weh ago gi yuh some 500 gallons a oil an more.</p>
<p>A great pity, now, dat dis unfortunate whale shuda be hare-lipped. Di fissure is bout a foot across. Probably di mada during an important interval did a sailing dung di Peruvian coast, wen earthquakes cause di beach fi gape. Ova dis lip, as ova a slippery threshold, wi now slide inna di mout. Pan mi word if mi did deh a Mackinaw, mi shuda tek dis fi be di inside a one Indian wigwam. Gud Laad! dis a di road weh Jonah did goh? Di roof is bout twelve feet high, an run to a pretty sharp angle, as if a did a regular ridge-pole deh; while dem ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present wi wid dem wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats a whalebone, say three hundred pan a side, weh depending fram di upper part a di head or crown bone, form dem Venetian blinds weh elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. Di edges a dem bones deh fringed wid hairy fibres, through which di Right Whale strain di water, an inna whose intricacies him retain di small fish, wen openmouth him go chuu di seas a brit inna feeding time. Inna di central blinds a bone, as dem stan inna dem natural order, deh have certain curious marks, curves, hollows, an ridges, weh some whalemen calculate di creature's age, as di age a one oak by its circular rings. Though di certainty a dis criterion is far fram demonstrable, yet it have di savor a analogical probability. At any rate, if wi yield to it, wi haffi grant a far greater age to di Right Whale dan at first glance will seem reasonable.</p>
<p>Inna old times, it did look like di most curious fancies dem did deh deh bout dem blinds yah. One voyager inna Purchas call dem di wondrous “whiskers” inside a di whale's mout;* anodda one, “hogs' bristles”; a third old gentleman inna Hackluyt use di following elegant language: “Dem have bout two hundred an fifty fins growing pan each side a him upper <i>chop</i> , weh arch ova him tongue pan each side a him mout.”</p>
<p>*Dis remind wi seh di Right Whale really have a sort a whisker, or rather a moustache, weh consist a few scattered white hairs pan di upper part a di outer end a di lower jaw. Somtaim dem tufts yah impart a rada brigandish expression to him otherwise solemn countenance.</p>
<p>As everybody know, dem same “hogs' bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,” “blinds,” or whatever yuh please, furnish to di ladies dem busks an other stiffening contrivances. But inna dis particular, di demand don deh pan di decline. A did inna Queen Anne's time dat di bone did inna it glory, di farthingale did deh den all di fashion. An as dem ancient dames move bout gaily, though inna di jaws a di whale, as yuh may seh; even so, inna a shower, wid di like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly unda di same jaws fi protection; di umbrella being a tent spread ova di same bone.</p>
<p>But now forget all bout blinds an whiskers fi a moment, an, standing inna di Right Whale's mout, look roun yuh afresh. Wen yuh si all dem colonnades a bone so methodically range bout, yuh wouldn't tink yuh did deh inna di great Haarlem organ, an a look pan it thousand pipes? Fi a carpet to di organ wi have a rug a di softest Turkey—di tongue, weh glue, as it were, to di floor a di mout. It very fat an tender, an apt fi tear inna pieces wen yuh hoist it pan deck. Dis particular tongue now before wi; at a passing glance mi shuda seh it was a six-barreler; dat mean, it ago gi yuh bout dat deh amount a oil.</p>
<p>Ere dis, yuh mus have plainly see di truth a weh mi staat wid—dat di Sperm Whale an di Right Whale have almost entirely different heads. Fi sum up, den: inna di Right Whale's deh nuh have no big well a sperm; no ivory teet at all; no long, slender mandible a one lower jaw, like di Sperm Whale's. Nor inna di Sperm Whale deh deh any a dem blinds a bone; no huge lower lip; an scarcely anyting of a tongue. Again, di Right Whale have two external spout-holes, di Sperm Whale only one.</p>
<p>Look yuh last, now, pan dem venerable hooded heads, while dem still lie tugeda; fi one ago soon sink, unrecorded, inna di sea; di ada one naa go be very long inna following.</p>
<p>Yuh can ketch di expression a di Sperm Whale dem deh? A di same ting him did ded wid, only some a di longer wrinkles inna di forehead look like dem did a fide weh now. Mi tink him brow brow full a prairie-like placidity, born a speculative indifference as to death. But mark di ada head's expression. See dat amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against di vessel's side, so as firmly fi embrace di jaw. Dis whole head nuh look like it a talk bout an enormous practical resolution inna facing death? Dis Right Whale mi tek fi be a Stoic; di Sperm Whale, a Platonian, weh mighta did tek up Spinoza inna him latta years.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00081">CHAPTER 76. Di Battering-Ram.</h2>
<p>Ere quitting, fi di nonce, di Sperm Whale's head, mi woulda have yuh, as a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. Mi woulda mek yuh investigate it now wid di sole view a form to yuhself some unexaggerated, intelligent estimate a whatever battering-ram power may be lodged deh. Yahso a one vital point; fi yuh haffi either satisfactorily settle dis matter wid yuhself, or fi eva remain an infidel as to one a di most appalling, but not di less true events, perhaps anywhere fi find inna all recorded history.</p>
<p>Yuh observe seh inna di ordinary swimming position a di Sperm Whale, di front a him head present an almost wholly vertical plane to di wata; yuh observe seh di lower part a dat deh front slope considerably backwards, so as fi furnish more a retreat fi di long socket weh receive di boom-like lower jaw; yuh observe seh di mout deh entirely unda di head, much inna di same way, indeed, as if yuh own mout did entirely unda yuh chin. Moreover yuh observe seh di whale have no external nose; an dat weh nose him have—im spout hole—de pan di top a him head; yuh observe seh him eyes an ears dem deh a di sides a him head, nearly one third a him entire length fram di front. So, yuh mus now have perceived seh di front a di Sperm Whale's head a one dead, blind wall, widout a single organ or tender prominence a any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, yuh fi consider now seh only inna di extreme, lower, backward sloping part a di front a di head, is deh di slightest vestige a bone; an not til yuh get near twenty feet fram di forehead yuh come to di full cranial development. So dat dis whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise di most delicate oil; yet, yuh a fi be apprised a di nature a di substance weh so impregnably invest all dat apparent effeminacy. Inna some previous place mi did describe to yuh how di blubber wrap di body a di whale, as di rind wrap an orange. Jus so wid di head; but wid dis difference: bout di head dis envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who neva handle it. Di severest pointed harpoon, di sharpest lance weh di strongest human arm dart, impotently rebound fram it. It is like if di forehead a di Sperm Whale did pave wid horses' hoofs. Mi no tink seh no sensation lurk inna it.</p>
<p>Tingk bout wan neda ting tu. Wen two big, loaded Indiamen chance fi crowd an crush towards each other inna di docks, weh di sailors do? Dem no suspend between dem, at di point a coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, dem hold deh a big, round wad a tow an cork, enveloped inna di thickest an toughest a ox-hide. Dat bravely an uninjured tek di jam weh woulda snap all dem oaken handspikes an iron crow-bars. By itself dis sufficiently illustrate di obvious fact mi drive at. But supplementary to dis, it have hypothetically occurred to mi, dat as ordinary fish possess weh dem call a swimming bladder inna dem, capable, at will, of distension or contraction; an as di Sperm Whale, as far as mi know, nuh have no such provision inna him; considering, too, di otherwise inexplicable manner in which him now depress him head altogether unda di surface, an anon swim wid it high elevated outa di wata; considering di unobstructed elasticity a it envelope; considering di unique interior a him head; it have hypothetically occur to mi, mi seh, dat dem mystical lung-celled honeycombs deh may possibly have some hitherto unknown an unsuspected connexion wid di outer air, so as fi be susceptible to atmospheric distension an contraction. If dis be so, fancy di irresistibleness a dat deh might, to which di most impalpable an destructive a all elements contribute.</p>
<p>Now, mark. Unerringly impelling dis dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall, an dis most buoyant ting widin; deh swim behind it all a mass a tremendous life, only fi be adequately estimated as piled wood is—by di cord; an all obedient to one volition, as di smallest insect. So dat wen mi shall hereafter detail to yuh all di specialties an concentrations a potency everyweh lurking inna dis expansive monster; wen mi ago show yuh some a him more inconsiderable braining feats; Mi trust yuh wi don renounced all ignorant incredulity, an be ready fi abide by dis; dat though di Sperm Whale stove a passage thru di Isthmus of Darien, an mix di Atlantic wid di Pacific, yuh wouldn't elevate one hair a yuh eye-brow. For unless yuh own di whale, yuh a jus a provincial an sentimentalist inna Truth. But clear Truth a one ting fi salamander giants only fi encounter; how small di chances fi di provincials den? Weh did happen di weakling youth weh did a lift di dread goddess's veil at Lais?</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00082">CHAPTER 77. Di Great Heidelburgh Tun.</h2>
<p>Now come di Baling a di Case. But fi andastan it rait, yuh haffi know someting bout di curious internal structure a di ting weh yuh operate pan.</p>
<p>Regarding di Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, yuh can, pan an inclined plane, sideways divide it inna two quoins,* whichof di lower a di bony structure, forming di cranium an jaws, an di upper a one unctuous mass wholly free fram bones; it broad forward end forming di expanded vertical apparent forehead a di whale. At di middle a di forehead horizontally subdivide dis upper quoin, an den yuh have two almost equal parts, weh before dem did naturally divided by an internal wall a one thick tendinous substance.</p>
<p>*Quoin a nuh Euclidean term. It belong to di pure nautical mathematics. Mi no know seh it don define before. A quoin a one solid weh differ fram a wedge inna having it shaap end weh form by di steep inclination a one side, instead a di mutual tapering a both sides.</p>
<p>Di lower subdivided part, weh dem call di junk, a one immense honeycomb a oil, weh mek by di crossing an recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated cells, a tough elastic white fibers throughout it whole extent. Di upper part, weh dem call di Case, maita be regarded as di great Heidelburgh Tun a di Sperm Whale. An as dat famous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so di whale's vast plaited forehead form innumerable strange devices fi di emblematical adornment a him wondrous tun. Moreover, as dat a Heidelburgh did always replenished wid di most excellent a di wines a di Rhenish valleys, so di tun a di whale contain by far di most precious a all him oily vintages; namely, di highly-prized spermaceti, inna it absolutely pure, limpid, an odoriferous state. Nor dis precious substance is found unalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though inna life it remain perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to di air, afta death, it soon staat to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as wen di first thin delicate ice a jus form inna water. A big whale's case generally yield bout five hundred gallons a sperm, though fram unavoidable circumstances, considerable a it spill, leaks, an dribbles weh, or is otherwise irrevocably lost inna di ticklish business a securing weh yuh can.</p>
<p>Mi no know wid weh fine an costly material di Heidelburgh Tun did coat widin, but inna superlative richness dat coating couldn't possibly have compared wid di silken pearl-coloured membrane, like di lining a one fine pelisse, weh did a form di inner surface a di Sperm Whale's case.</p>
<p>It woulda been seen dat di Heidelburgh Tun a di Sperm Whale embrace di entire length a di entire top a di head; an since—as has been elsewhere set forth—di head embrace one third a di whole length a di creature, den setting dat length dung at eighty feet fi a good sized whale, yuh have more dan twenty-six feet fi di depth a di tun, wen it lengthwise hoisted up an dung against a ship's side.</p>
<p>As in decapitating di whale, di operator's instrument is bring close to di spot weh an entrance is subsequently forced into di spermaceti magazine; him haffi, so, be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless, untimely stroke shuda invade di sanctuary an wastingly let out its invaluable contents. A dis decapitated end a di head, also, weh at last elevate outa di wata, an retain inna dat deh position by di enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, pan one side, mek quite a wilderness a ropes inna dat deh quarter.</p>
<p>So much being said, attend now, mi pray yuh, to dat marvelous an—in dis particular instance—almost fatal operation whichby di Sperm Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00083">CHAPTER 78. Cistern an Buckets.</h2>
<p>Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; an widout altering him erect posture, run straight out pan di overhanging mainyard-arm, to di part weh it exactly project ova di hoisted Tun. Him did carry wid him a light tackle weh dem call a whip, weh consist a only two parts, traveling through a single-sheaved block. Securing dis block, so dat it hang dung fram di yard-arm, him swing one end a di rope, til it get ketch an firmly hold by a han pan deck. Den, hand-over-hand, dung di ada part, di Indian drop chruu di air, til dexterously him land pan di summit a di head. Deh—stil high elevated above di rest a di company, to whom him vivaciously cries—im seem some Turkish Muezzin a call di good people dem to prayers fram di top a one tower. A short-handled sharp spade weh dem sen up to him, him diligently search fi di proper place fi staat break inna di Tun. Inna dis business him proceed very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter inna some old house, sounding di walls fi find weh di gold is masoned in. By di time dis cautious search don, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a well-bucket, have been attached to one end a di whip; while di ada end, being stretch across di deck, deh deh hold by two or three alert hands. Dem last now hoist di bucket widin grasp a di Indian, to whom anodda person reach up a very long pole. Inserting dis pole inna di bucket, Tashtego downward guide di bucket inna di Tun, til it entirely disappear; den gi di wod tu di siman dem a di whip, op kom di bucket agen, aal a dem a bubble laik a dairy-maid pail a nyuu milk. Carefully lowered fram it height, di full-freighted vessel is catch by an appointed hand, an quickly empty inna a large tub. Den remounting aloft, it again go thru di same round until di deep cistern will yield no more. Towards di end, Tashtego haffi ram him long pole harder an harder, an deeper an deeper inna di Tun, until some twenty feet a di pole don go dung.</p>
<p>Now, di people dem a di Pequod did a baling some time inna dis way; several tubs did full a di fragrant sperm; wen all at once a queer accident happen. Weda it was dat Tashtego, dat deh wild Indian, did so heedless an reckless as fi let go fi a moment him one-handed hold pan di great cabled tackles weh did a suspen di head; or weda di place weh him did a stan op did so treacherous an oozy; or weda di Evil One himself woulda have it fi fall out so, widout stating him particular reasons; how it did deh exactly, yuh can tell now; but, pan a sudden, as di eightieth or ninetieth bucket come suckingly up—mi God! poor Tashtego—like di twin reciprocating bucket inna a veritable well, drop head-foremost dung inna dis great Tun a Heidelburgh, an wid a horrible oily gurgling, go clean out a sight!</p>
<p>“Man ovaboard!” Daggoo baal out, weh inna di general consternation fos come to him senses. “Swing di bucket dis way!” an put one foot inna it, so as di better fi secure him slippery hand-hold pan di whip itself, di hoisters dem run him high up to di top a di head, almost before Tashtego coulda reach it interior bottom. Meantime, a did a terrible tumult. Wen dem look ova di side, dem si di before lifeless head a throbbing an a heave jus below di surface a di sea, as if dat deh moment seize wid some momentous idea; whereas it was only di poor Indian unconsciously revealing by dem deh struggles di perilous depth to which him did sunk.</p>
<p>At dis instant, while Daggoo, pan di summit a di head, did a clear di whip—we did somehow get foul a di great cutting tackles—a sharp cracking noise did hear; an to di unspeakable horror a all, one a di two enormous hooks dem weh did a suspen di head tore out, an wid a vast vibration di enormous mass sideways swing, til di drunk ship reeled an shook as if smitted by an iceberg. Di one hook weh did lef, weh di entire strain did a depend pan, did look like every instant it did deh pan di point a giving way; an event still more likely fram di violent motions a di head.</p>
<p>“Kom dong, kom dong!” di siman dem baal out tu Daggoo, bot wid wan han a uol aan pan di hevi takl dem, so dat if di ed shuda jrap, im wuda stil tan op; di negro did clear di foul line, ram dung di bucket inna di now collapsed well, meaning seh di buried harpooneer shuda grab it, an so be hoisted out.</p>
<p>“Inna heaven's name, man,” Stubb baal out, “yuh a ramp home a cartridge deh?—Avast! How dat ago help him; jamming dat deh iron-bound bucket pan top a him head? Avast, yuh will!”</p>
<p>“Stand clear a di tackle!” a baal out a voice like di bursting a one rocket.</p>
<p>Almost inna di same instant, wid a thunder-boom, di enormous mass drop inna di sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock inna di whirlpool; di suddenly relieved hull roll weh fram it, to far dung har glittering copper; an all ketch dem breath, as half swinging—now ova di sailors dem head, an now ova di wata—Daggoo, chruu a thick mist a spray, did a dimly beheld clinging to di pendulous tackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego did a sink utterly dung to di bottom a di sea! But hardly did di blinding vapor clear weh, wen a naked figure wid a boarding-sword inna him han, was fi one swift moment seen hovering ova di bulwarks. Di neks, a loud splash announce seh mi brave Queequeg did dive to di rescue. One packed rush did mek to di side, an every eye count every ripple, as moment followed moment, an no sign a either di sinker or di diver coulda be seen. Some hands now jump inna a boat alongside, an push a likkle off fram di ship.</p>
<p>“Ha! ha!” Daggoo baal out, all at once, fram him now quiet, swinging perch ovahead; an looking further off fram di side, wi si a arm thrust upright fram di blue waves; a sight strange fi see, as an arm thrust forth fram di grass ova a grave.</p>
<p>“Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again wid a joyful shout; an soon afta, dem did si Queequeg a strike out wid one han, an wid di ada wan a clutch di lang hair a di Indian. Dem did draw inna di waiting boat, an dem did quickly bring dem to di deck; but Tashtego did long inna coming to, an Queequeg neva look very brisk.</p>
<p>Now, how dis noble rescue did happen? Why, diving afta di slowly descending head, Queequeg wid him keen sword did mek side lunges near it bottom, so as fi scuttle a big hole deh; den drop him sword, did thrust him long arm far inwards an upwards, an so haul out poor Tash by di head. Im averred, seh upon first thrusting in fi him, a leg did present; but well knowing dat dat neva as it shuda be, an might occasion great trouble;—im did thrust back di leg, an by a dexterous heave an toss, did wrought a somerset upon di Indian; so dat wid di neks trial, him come out inna di good ole way—head foremost. As fi di great head itself, dat did a do as well as yuh coulda expect.</p>
<p>An so, chruu di courage an great skill inna obstetrics a Queequeg, di deliverance, or rather, delivery a Tashtego, did successfully accomplished, inna di teet, too, a di most untoward an apparently hopeless impediments; weh a one lesson by no means fi be forget. Midwifery shuda be teach inna di same course wid fencing an boxing, riding an rowing.</p>
<p>Mi know seh dis queer adventure a di Gay-Header dem ago be sure fi seem incredible to some landsmen, though demself may either see or hear bout some one a fall inna a cistern ashore; an accident weh not seldom happen, an wid much less reason too dan di Indian's, considering di exceeding slipperiness a di curb a di Sperm Whale's well.</p>
<p>But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how dis is? Wi did tink seh di tissued, infiltrated head a di Sperm Whale, was di lightest an most corky part bout him; an yet yuh mek it sink inna wan element a far greater specific gravity dan itself. Wi have yuh deh. Not at all, but mi have unu; fi at di time poor Tash did fall in, di case did nearly empty a it lighter contents, lef likkle but di dense tendinous wall a di well—a double welded, hammered substance, as mi did seh before, much heavier dan di sea water, an a lump a weh sink inna it like lead almost. But di tendency fi rapid sinking inna dis substance was inna di present instance materially counteracted by di ada parts a di head weh did remain undetached fram it, so dat it did sink very slowly an deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance fi perform him agile obstetrics pan di run, as yuh may seh. Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.</p>
<p>Now, if Tashtego did perish inna dat deh head, it woulda been a very precious perishing; smothered inna di very whitest an daintiest a fragrant spermaceti; coffin, hearse, an tombed inna di secret inner chamber an sanctum sanctorum a di whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled—di delicious death a one Ohio honey-hunter, who did a look fi honey inna di crotch a one hollow tree, find such exceeding store a it, dat leaning too far ova, it suck him in, so dat him dead embalmed. How many, yuh tink, don fall inna Plato's honey head, an sweetly perish deh?</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00084">CHAPTER 79. Di Prairie.</h2>
<p>Fi scan di lines a him face, or feel di bumps pan di head a dis Leviathan; dis a one ting weh no Physiognomist or Phrenologist neva andastan yet. Such an enterprise woulda seem almost as hopeful as fi Lavater did scrutinize di wrinkles pan di Rock a Gibraltar, or fi Gall did mount a ladder an manipulate di Dome of di Pantheon. Stil, inna dat deh famous work a him, Lavater no ongl treat a di various faces a man, but also attentively study di faces a horses, birds, serpents, an fish; an dwell in detail upon di modifications a expression discernible inna it. Nor have Gall an him disciple Spurzheim fail fi throw out some hints touching di phrenological characteristics a ada beings dan man. So, though mi is but ill qualified fi a pioneer, inna di application a dem two semi-sciences to di whale, mi ago do mi endeavor. Mi try all tings; Mi achieve weh mi can.</p>
<p>Physiognomically regarded, di Sperm Whale a one anomalous creature. Him nuh have no proper nose. An since di nose a di central an most conspicuous a di features; an since it perhaps most modifies an finally control dem combined expression; hence it woulda seem seh its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect di countenance a di whale. Fi as inna landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower a some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to di completion a di scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping widout di elevated open-work belfry a di nose. Dash di nose fram Phidias's marble Jove, an what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is a so mighty a magnitude, all him proportions dem so stately, dat di same deficiency weh inna di sculptured Jove did hideous, inna him is no blemish at all. Nay, it a one added grandeur. A nose to di whale woulda been impertinent. As pan yuh physiognomical voyage yuh sail roun him vast head inna yuh jolly-boat, yuh noble conceptions a him neva get insult by di reflection seh him have a nose fi be pull. A pestilent conceit, weh so often ago insist pan obtruding even wen yuh a look pan di mightiest royal beadle pan him throne.</p>
<p>In some particulars, perhaps di most imposing physiognomical view fi have a di Sperm Whale, is dat a di full front a him head. Dis aspect is sublime.</p>
<p>In thought, a fine human brow is like di East wen yuh trouble wid di morning. Inna di repose a di pasture, di curled brow a di bull have a touch a di grand inna it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, di elephant's brow is majestic. Human or animal, di mystical brow is as dat deh great golden seal weh di German emperors dem did a fix to dem decrees. It signify—“God: done dis day by mi hand.” But inna most creatures, nay inna man himself, very often di brow is but a mere strip a alpine land weh deh along di snow line. Few a di foreheads dem weh like Shakespeare's or Melancthon's rise so high, an descend so low, dat di eyes demself look clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; an all above dem inna di forehead's wrinkles, yuh seem fi track di antlered thoughts dem weh a go dong deh fi drink, as di Highland hunters dem track di snow prints a di deer. But inna di great Sperm Whale, dis high an mighty god-like dignity inherent inna di brow is so immensely amplified, dat gazing pan it, inna dat deh full front view, yuh feel di Deity an di dread powers more forcibly dan in beholding any other object inna living nature. For yuh no see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; him nuh have none, proper; notn but dat one broad firmament a one forehead, pleated wid riddles; dumbly lowering wid di doom a boats, an ships, an man. Nor, in profile, does dis wondrous brow diminish; though dat way viewed its grandeur nuh domineer upon yuh so. Inna profile, yuh plainly perceive dat horizontal, semi-crescentic depression inna di forehead's middle, weh, inna man, a Lavater's mark a genius.</p>
<p>But how? Genius inna di Sperm Whale? Di Sperm Whale eva write a book, taak a speech? No, him great genius is declared in him doing notn particular fi prove it. It is moreover declared inna him pyramidical silence. An dis remind mi seh if di great Sperm Whale did know to di young Orient World, him woulda did deified by dem child-magian thoughts. Dem did deify di crocodile a di Nile, cause di crocodile a tongueless; an di Sperm Whale no have no tongue, or at least it so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to dem birth-right, di merry May-day gods of old; an livingly enthrone dem again inna di now egotistical sky; inna di now unhaunted hill; den be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat, di great Sperm Whale shall lord it.</p>
<p>Champollion decipher di wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But no Champollion nuh deh fi decipher di Egypt a every man's an every being's face. Physiognomy, like every ada human science, a jus a passing fable. If den, Sir William Jones, weh read inna thirty languages, couldn't read di simplest peasant's face inna it profounder an more subtle meanings, how unlettered Ishmael may hope fi read di awful Chaldee a di Sperm Whale's brow? Mi but put dat brow deh before yuh. Read it if yuh can.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00085">CHAPTER 80. Di Nut.</h2>
<p>If di Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to di phrenologist him brain look like dat geometrical circle weh it impossible fi square.</p>
<p>Inna di full-grown creature di skull ago measure at least twenty feet in length. Unhinge di lower jaw, an di side view a dis skull is as di side a one moderately inclined plane resting throughout pan a level base. But inna life—as we have elsewhere seen—dis inclined plane is angularly filled up, an almost squared by di enormous superincumbent mass a di junk an sperm. At di high end di skull form a crater to bed dat deh part a di mass; while unda di long floor a dis crater—inna anodda cavity weh seldom exceeding ten inches in length an as many in depth—repose di mere handful a dis monster's brain. Di brain deh at least twenty feet fram him apparent forehead inna life; it hidden weh behind it vast outworks, like di innermost citadel widin di amplified fortifications a Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, dat mi have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny dat di Sperm Whale have any other brain dan dat deh palpable semblance a one formed by di cubic-yards a him sperm magazine. Liing inna strange folds, courses, an convolutions, to dem apprehensions, it seems more in keeping wid di idea a him general might fi regard dat deh mystic part a him as di seat a him intelligence.</p>
<p>It is plain, den, dat phrenologically di head a dis Leviathan, inna di creature's living intact state, a one entire delusion. As fi him true brain, yuh can den see no indications a it, nor feel any. Di whale, like all tings weh mighty, wear a false brow to di common world.</p>
<p>If yuh unload him skull a it spermy heaps an den tek a rear view a it rear end, weh a di high end, yuh wi be struck by its resemblance to di human skull, beheld inna di same situation, an fram di same point a view. Indeed, place dis reversed skull (scaled dung to di human magnitude) mongst a plate a man's skulls, an yuh woulda involuntarily confound it wid dem; an remarking di depressions pan one part a it summit, in phrenological phrase yuh woulda seh—Dis man neva have no self-esteem, an no veneration. An by dem negations deh, considered along wid di affirmative fact a him prodigious bulk an power, yuh can best form to yuhself di truest, though not di most exhilarating conception a weh di most exalted potency is.</p>
<p>But if fram di comparative dimensions a di whale's proper brain, yuh deem it incapable fi be adequately charted, den mi have anodda idea fi yuh. If yuh attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine, yuh wi be struck wid di resemblance a it vertebræ tu a strung necklace a dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to di skull proper. A one German conceit, dat di vertebræ dem a absolutely undeveloped skulls. But di curious external resemblance, mi tek it di Germans dem neva di first man fi perceive. A foreign fren once point it out to mi, inna di skeleton a one foe weh him did slain, an wid di vertebræ weh him did a inlaying, inna a sort a basso-relievo, di beaked prow a him canoe. Now, mi consider seh di phrenologists dem omit an important ting inna not pushing dem investigations fram di cerebellum chruu di spinal canal. For mi believe seh much a man character ago be tokened inna him backbone. Mi woulda radda feel yuh spine dan yuh skull, whoeva yuh is. A thin joist a spine neva yet uphold a full an noble soul. Mi glad inna mi spine, as inna di firm audacious staff a dat deh flag weh mi fling half out to di world.</p>
<p>Apply dis spinal branch a phrenology to di Sperm Whale. Him cranial cavity is continuous wid di first neck-vertebra; an inna dat deh vertebra di bottom a di spinal canal ago measure ten inches across, being eight inna height, an a one triangular figure wid di base dungwards. As it pass thru di remaining vertebræ di canal tapers inna size, but fi a considerable distance remains a large capacity. Now, a course, dis canal full a di same strangely fibrous substance—di spinal cord—as di brain; an directly communicate wid di brain. An weh still more, fi plenty feet afta dem come outa di brain's cavity, di spinal cord remain a undecreasing girth, almost equal to dat a di brain. Anda all dem circumstances yah, it woulda be unreasonable fi survey an map out di whale's spine phrenologically? For, viewed inna dis light, di wonderful comparative smallness a him brain proper is more dan compensated by di wonderful comparative magnitude a him spinal cord.</p>
<p>But lef dis hint fi operate as it may wid di phrenologists, mi woulda merely assume di spinal theory fi a moment, in reference to di Sperm Whale's hump. Dis august hump, if mi mistake not, rise ova one a di larger vertebræ, an is, therefore, in some sort, di outer convex mold a it. Fram it relative situation den, mi shuda call dis high hump di organ a firmness or indomitableness inna di Sperm Whale. An dat di great monster is indomitable, yuh wi still have reason fi know.</p>
