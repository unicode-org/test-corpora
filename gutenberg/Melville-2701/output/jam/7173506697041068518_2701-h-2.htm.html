<h2 id="pgepubid00009">CHAPTER 4. Di Counterpane.</h2>
<p>Wen mi wake next morning bout daylight, mi find Queequeg's arm throw ova mi inna di most loving an affectionate manner. Yuh did almost tink seh mi was him wife. Di counterpane was a patchwork, full a odd likkle parti-coloured squares an triangles; an dis arm a him tattooed all ova wid an interminable Cretan labyrinth a one figure, no two parts a weh did a one precise shade—owing mi suppose to him did a keep him arm at sea unmethodically inna sun an shade, him shirt sleeves irregularly roll up at various times—dis same arm a him, all look like di same world strip quilt. Indeed, partly lying pan it as di arm did wen mi first awake, mi couldn't hardly tell it fram di quilt, dem so blend dem hues tugeda; an it was only by di sense a weight an pressure dat mi coulda tell seh Queequeg did a hug mi.</p>
<p>Mi sensations dem did strange. Mek mi try explain dem. Wen mi was a pikni, mi well memba a somewhat similar circumstance weh did happen mi; weda it was a reality or a dream, mi neva coulda entirely settle. Di circumstance was dis. Mi did a cut up some caper or other—mi tink it did a try crawl up di chimney, as mi did see a likkle sweep do a few days before; an mi stepmother weh, somehow or other, did all di time a whip mi, or a send mi to bed supperless,—mi mada did a drag mi by di legs outa di chimney an pack mi off to bed, though it was only two o'clock inna di aftanuun a di 21st June, di longest day inna di year inna wi hemisphere. Mi did feel dreadfully. But no help neva deh fi it, so up stairs mi goh to mi likkle room inna di third floor, undressed miself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, an wid a bitter sigh get between di sheets.</p>
<p>Mi did a lidong deh dismally a calculate seh sixteen entire hours haffi pass before mi coulda hope fi a resurrection. Sixteen hours inna bed! di likl a mi bak did a pien fi tingk bout it. An it did so light too; di sun a shain inna di window, an a great rattling a coaches inna di streets, an di sound a gay voices all ova di house. Mi did a feel worse an worse—at last mi get up, dress, an softly go dung inna mi stockinged foot dem, look out fi mi stepmother, an suddenly throw miself at har foot dem, beg har as a particular favor fi gi mi a good slippering fi mi misbehaviour; anyting indeed but condemning mi fi lie abed such an unendurable length a time. But she was di bes an most concientious a stepmothers, an back mi did haffi go a mi room. Fi several hours mi did a lay deh broad awake, a feel a great deal worse dan mi eva do since, even fram di greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last mi mosi did fall inna a troubled nightmare a doze; an slowly waking fram it—half steeped inna dreams—mi open mi eyes, an di before sun-lit room did now wrap inna outer darkness. Instantly mi feel a shock running through all mi frame; notn neva fi si, an notn neva fi ier; but a supernatural hand did look like it did deh inna mi. Mi arm did a hang ova di counterpane, an di nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, weh di han did belong to, did look like it did deh closely by mi bed-side. Fi weh did look like ages did a pail op pan ages, mi did a lay deh, frozen wid di most awful fears, neva daring fi drag weh mi han; yet ever tinkin seh if mi coulda but stir it one single inch, di horrid spell woulda be broken. Mi neva know how dis consciousness at last glide weh fram mi; but wen mi did a wake op inna di maanin, mi did a memba it all, an fi days an weeks an months aftawards mi lost miself inna confounding attempts fi explain di mystery. Nay, to dis very hour, mi often puzzle miself wid it.</p>
<p>Now, tek weh di awful fear, an mi sensations at feeling di supernatural han inna mine did very similar, inna dem strangeness, to dem weh mi did experience wen mi wake up an see Queequeg's pagan arm throw roun mi. But at length all di past night's events soberly recurred, one by one, inna fixed reality, an den mi lay only alive to di comical predicament. For though mi did a try move him arm—unlock him bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as him did, him still hug mi tightly, as if not but death woulda part wi twoin. Mi now strive fi rouse him—“Queequeg!”—but him only ansa was a snore. Mi den roll ova, mi neck a feel like it did deh inna a horse-collar; an suddenly feel a slight scratch. Throw aside di counterpane, deh did lay di tomahawk sleeping by di savage's side, as if it was a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, did tink mi; abed yah inna a strange house inna di broad day, wid a cannibal an a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—inna di name a goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint a much wriggling, an loud an incessant expostulations upon di unbecomingness a him hugging a fellow male inna dat deh matrimonial sort a style, mi succeed inna extracting a grunt; an presently, him draw back him arm, shook himself all ova like a Newfoundland dog jus fram di wata, an sidong up inna bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking pon mi, an rub him eyes as if him neva altogether memba how mi come fi deh deh, though a dim consciousness a knowing someting bout mi slowly did a come ova him. Meanwhile, mi did a lay quietly a look pan him, wid no serious misgivings now, an bent pan narrowly observing so curious a creature. Wen, at last, him mind did look like him did mek up fi touch di character a him bedfellow, an him did become, as it were, reconciled to di fact; him jump out pan di floor, an by certain signs an sounds gi mi fi andastan seh, if it pleased mi, him woulda dress fos an den lef mi fi dress aftawards, lef di whole apartment fi miself. Mi tink, Queequeg, anda di circumstances, dis a one very civilized overture; but, di truth is, dem savages yah have a innate sense a delicacy, seh weh yuh waan; it marvelous how essentially polite dem is. Mi pay dis particular compliment to Queequeg, cause him did treat mi wid so much civility an consideration, while mi did guilty a great rudeness; staring at him fram di bed, an watch all him toilette motions; fi di time mi curiosity a get di beta a mi breeding. Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg yuh nuh see every day, him an him ways did well worth unusual regarding.</p>
<p>Im staat dress at top by donning im beaver hat, a very tall one, by di by, an den—still minus im trowsers—im hunt up im boots. Weh anda di skai im did du it fa, mi kyaahn tel, bot im neks muuvment a fi mash imself—boot ina im an, an hat aan—anda di bed; wen, fram sundry violent gaspings an strainings, mi infer seh him did a work hard at booting himself; though by no law of propriety weh mi eva hear bout, is any man required fi be private wen dem a put on him boots. But Queequeg, yuh see, was a creature inna di transition stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. Im did jus enough civilized fi show off im outlandishness inna di strangest possible manners. Im edikieshan neva don yet. Im was an undergraduate. If him neva did a likkle degree civilized, him very probably wouldn't trouble himself wid boots at all; but den, if him neva still a savage, him neva woulda dream bout get unda di bed fi put dem on. At last, him come out wid him hat very much dented an crushed dung ova him eyes, an staat creak an limping bout di room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, him pair a damp, wrinkled cowhide ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinch an tormented him at di first go off a one bitter cold morning.</p>
<p>Siin, now, dat deh neva have no curtains to di window, an dat di street did very narrow, di house opposite command a plain view inna di room, an observing more an more di indecorous figure weh Queequeg mek, staving bout wid likkle else but him hat an boots on; Mi beg him as well as mi coulda, fi accelerate him toilet likkle, an particularly fi get inna him pantaloons as soon as possible. Im comply, an den proceed fi wash imself. At dat deh time inna di morning any Christian woulda wash him face; but Queequeg, to mi amazement, content himself wid restricting him ablutions to him chest, arms, an hands. Den him don him waistcoat, an tek up a piece a hard soap pan di wash-stand center table, dip it inna wata an staat lather him face. Mi did a watch fi si weh him did a kip him razor, wen lo an behold, him tek di harpoon fram di bed corner, slip out di long wooden stock, unsheathe di head, whet it likkle pan him boot, an stride up to di bit a mirror against di wall, staat a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning a him cheeks. Mi tink, Queequeg, dis a use Rogers's bes cutlery wid a vengeance. Aftawod mi wanda di les at dis opreshan wen mi kom fi nuo a wa fain stiel di ed a wahn harpoon mek, an ou exceedingly shaap di lang schriet ej dem aalwiez kip.</p>
<p>Di res a him toilet did soon achieve, an him proudly march outa di room, wrap up inna him great pilot monkey jacket, an sporting him harpoon like a marshal's baton.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00010">CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.</h2>
<p>Mi quickly follow suit, an descending inna di bar-room accosted di grinning landlord very pleasantly. Mi neva cherish no malice towards him, though him did a skylark wid mi not a likkle inna di matter a mi bedfellow.</p>
<p>However, a good laugh a one mighty good ting, an rather too scarce a good ting; di more's di pity. So, if any one man, inna him own proper person, afford stuff fi a good joke to anybody, mek him nuh backward, but mek him cheerfully allow himself fi spend an be spent inna dat deh way. An di man weh have anyting bountifully laughable bout him, mek sure seh more inna dat deh man deh dan yuh perhaps tink fi.</p>
<p>Di bar-room did full a di boarders dem weh did a drop in di night before, an weh mi neva have a good look pan yet. Dem was nearly all whalemen; chief mates, an secan mates, an third mates, an sea carpenters, an sea coopers, an sea blacksmiths, an harpooneers, an ship keepers; a brown an brawny company, wid bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets fi morning gowns.</p>
<p>Yuh coulda pretty plainly tell how long each one did deh ashore. Dis young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear inna hue, an woulda seem fi smell almost as musky; him cyaan have been three days landed fram him Indian voyage. Dat deh man next him look a few shades lighter; yuh might seh a touch a satin wood deh inna him. Inna di complexion a di third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached widal; <i>him</i> doubtless did stay whole weeks asshore. But who coulda show a cheek like Queequeg? weh, barred wid various tints, did look like di Andes' western slope, fi show forth inna one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.</p>
<p>“Grub, ho!” now di landlord did a baal out, a fling open a door, an inna wi goh fi breakfast.</p>
<p>Dem seh dat man weh don si di worl, deh ton quite at ease inna manner, quite self-possessed inna company. Not always, though: Ledyard, di great New England traveller, an Mungo Park, di Scotch one; a all man, dem did have di least assurance inna di parlor. But perhaps di mere crossing a Siberia inna a sledge weh dog dem draw like Ledyard did, or di tek a long solitary walk pan an empty stomach, inna di negro heart a Africa, weh was di sum a poor Mungo's performances—dis kind a travel, mi seh, may not be di very bes mode fi attain a high social polish. Stil, fi di most part, dat deh sort a ting deh fi have anyweh.</p>
<p>Dem reflections yah jus yah a occasioned by di circumstance dat afta wi did all sidong a di table, an mi did a prepare fi hear some good stories bout whaling; to mi no small surprise, nearly every man maintain a profound silence. An a no ongl dat, bot dem luk shiemful. Yes, yahso a did a set a sea-dogs, plenty a dem widout di slightest bashfulness did board big whales pan di high seas—entire strangers to dem—an duel dem dead widout winking; an yet, yahso dem did sidong a wan social breakfast table—all a di same calling, all a kindred tastes—a look round as sheepishly at each other as if dem neva been out a sight a some sheepfold mongst di Green Mountains. A curious sight; dem bashful bears, dem timid warrior whalemen!</p>
<p>But as fi Queequeg—why, Queequeg did sidong deh mongst dem—at di head a di table, too, it so chance; as cool as an icicle. Fi be sure mi cyan seh much bout him breeding. Him greatest admirer couldn't have cordially justified him bringing him harpoon into breakfast wid him, an using it deh widout ceremony; reach ova di table wid it, to di imminent jeopardy a many heads, an grappling di beefsteaks towards him. But <i>dat</i> was certainly very coolly done by him, an everybody know seh inna most people's estimation, fi do anyting coolly is fi do it genteelly.</p>
<p>Wi naa go taak bout all Queequeg's peculiarities yah; how him eschewed coffee an hot rolls, an apply him undivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, dat wen breakfast don him withdraw like di rest inna di public room, light him tomahawk-pipe, an did a sidong deh quietly digesting an smoke wid him inseparable hat on, wen mi sallied out fi a stroll.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00011">CHAPTER 6. Di Street.</h2>
<p>If mi did astonish at first catching a glimpse a so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among di polite society a one civilized town, dat astonishment soon depart upon mi tek mi first daylight stroll thru di streets a New Bedford.</p>
<p>Inna thoroughfares nigh di docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer fi view di queerest looking nondescripts fram foreign parts. Even inna Broadway an Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle di affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; an at Bombay, inna di Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared di natives. But New Bedford beat all Water Street an Wapping. Inna dem last-mentioned haunts yah yuh see only sailors; but inna New Bedford, actual cannibals stan up a chat at street corners; savages outright; plenty a dem still a carry on dem bones unholy flesh. It mek a stranger stare.</p>
<p>But, besides di Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, an Brighggians, an, besides di wild specimens a di whaling-craft weh unheeded reel bout di streets, yuh wi si ada sights still more curious, certainly more comical. Deh weekly arrive inna dis town scores a green Vermonters an New Hampshire man, all thirst fi gain an glory inna di fishery. Dem mostly young, wid stalwart frames; fellows weh did fell forests, an now seek fi drop di axe an snatch di whale-lance. Plenty a dem green as di Green Mountains weh dem come fram. Inna some tings yuh woulda tink dem but a few hours old. Luk deh! dat deh chap deh a strut roun di corner. Im wear a beaver hat an swallow-tailed coat, girdled wid a sailor-belt an sheath-knife. Yahso come anodda wid a sou'-wester an a bombazine cloak.</p>
<p>No town-bred dandy naa go compare wid a country-bred one—mi mean a downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow weh, inna di dog-days, ago mow him two acres inna buckskin gloves fi fear a tanning him han dem. Now wen a country dandy like dis tek it inna him head fi mek a distinguished reputation, an join di great whale-fishery, yuh shuda see di comical tings dem weh him do wen him reach di seaport. In bespeaking him sea-outfit, him order bell-buttons to him waistcoats; straps to him canvas trousers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly ago burst dem straps deh inna di first howling gale, wen yuh get driven, straps, buttons, an all, dung di throat a di tempest.</p>
<p>But tink nuh seh dis famous town have only harpooneers, cannibals, an bumpkins fi show har visitors. No sah. Still New Bedford a one queer place. If it neva fi wi whalemen, dat deh tract a lan woulda dis day perhaps been in as howling condition as di coast a Labrador. As it is, parts a har back country are enough fi frighten one, dem look so bony. Di town itself a perhaps di dearest place fi live inna, inna all New England. A one lan a oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a lan, tu, a corn an wine. Di streets dem nuh run wid milk; nor inna di spring-time dem pave dem wid fresh eggs. Yet, in spite a dis, noweh inna all America yuh naa go find more patrician-like houses; parks an gardens more opulent, dan inna New Bedford. Weh dem come fram? how planted upon dis once scraggy scoria of a country?</p>
<p>Go an gaze upon di iron emblematical harpoons dem roun yonder lofty mansion, an yuh kweschan wi get ansa. Yea; all dem brave house an flowery gardens deh come fram di Atlantic, Pacific, an Indian oceans. One an all, dem did harpoon an drag dem up yah fram di bottom a di sea. Herr Alexander can perform a feat like dat?</p>
<p>Inna New Bedford, faada dem, dem seh, gi whales fi dowers to dem daughta dem, an portion off dem nieces wid a few porpoises a-piece. Yuh haffi go a New Bedford fi si a brilliant wedding; fi, dem seh, dem have reservoirs a oil inna every house, an every night recklessly burn dem lengths inna spermaceti candles.</p>
<p>Inna summer time, di town sweet fi see; full a fine maples—long avenues a green an gold. An inna August, high inna air, di beautiful an bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer di passer-by dem tapering upright cones a congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art; weh inna plenty a district a New Bedford have superinduced bright terraces a flowers upon di barren refuse rocks dem weh dem throw aside at creation's final day.</p>
<p>An di uman dem fram New Bedford, dem bloom laik fi dem uona red ruuz. But roses only bloom inna summer; whereas di fine carnation a dem cheeks is perennial as sunlight inna di seventh heavens. Elsewhere match dat deh bloom a dem, yuh can't, save inna Salem, weh dem tell mi seh di young girls dem breathe such musk, dem sailor sweethearts smell dem miles off shore, as if dem did a draw nigh di odorous Moluccas instead a di Puritanic sands.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00012">CHAPTER 7. Di Chapel.</h2>
<p>Inna dis same New Bedford deh deh a Whaleman's Chapel, an few a di moody fishermen dem, shortly bound fi di Indian Ocean or Pacific, weh fail fi mek a Sunday visit to di spot. Mi sure seh mi neva.</p>
<p>Wen mi did a come back fram mi first morning stroll, mi again sallied out pan dis special errand. Di sky did change fram clear, sunny cold, to driving sleet an mist. Mi wrapping miself inna mi shaggy jacket a di cloth weh dem call bearskin, an mi fight mi way against di stubborn storm. Wen mi go inna, mi find a likkle scattered congregation a sailors, an sailors wives an widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by di shrieks a di storm. Each silent worshiper did a sidong purposely apart fram di ada, as if each silent grief did insular an incommunicable. Di chaplain neva arrive yet; an deh deh dem silent islands a man an woman did a sidong steadfastly a look pan several marble tablets, wid black borders, masoned inna di wall pan either side di pulpit. Three a dem run someting like di following, but mi nuh pretend fi quote:—</p>
<p>SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at di age a eighteen, did lost ovaboard, Near di Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, <i>November</i> 1 <i>st</i> , 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to him Memory BY HIS SISTER.</p>
<p>SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one a di boats' crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who dem did tow out a sight by a Whale, On Official, inna di GFICE-OFFICE, inna di <i>December</i> 31 <i>st</i> , 1839. DIS MARBLE Is yah placed by dem surviving SHIPMATES.</p>
<p>SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF Di late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who inna di bows a him boat did get kill by a Sperm Whale pan di coast a Japan, <i>August</i> 3 <i>d</i> , 1833. DIS TABLET Is erected to him Memory BY HIS WIDOW.</p>
<p>Shaking off di sleet fram mi ice-glazed hat an jacket, mi sidong nier di door, an ton sideways an mi did sopraiz fi si Queequeg nier mi. Affected by di solemnity a di scene, deh did have a wondering gaze a incredulous curiosity inna him countenance. Dis savage was di only person weh did deh deh weh did look like him did notice mi entrance; cause him was di only one weh couldn't read, an, therefore, neva did a read dem frigid inscriptions deh pan di wall. Mi neva know if any a di relatives a di seamen dem weh dem name did deh deh deh now mongst di congregation; but so much a di unrecorded accidents inna di fishery, an so plainly did several women present wear di countenance if not di trappings a some unceasing grief, dat mi feel sure seh yah before mi did assemble dem, inna whose unhealing hearts di sight a dem bleak tablets sympathetically cause di old wounds fi bleed afresh.</p>
<p>Awo! yuh whose dead lay beri unda di green grass; who standing mongst flowers can seh—yah, <i>yahso</i> mi beloved lie; unu no know di desolation weh brood inna boss like dem ya. Wat bitter blanks inna dem black-bordered marbles weh cover no ashes! Wat despair inna dem immovable inscriptions deh! Wat deadly voids an unbidden infidelities inna di lines dem weh seem fi gnaw upon all Faith, an refuse resurrections to di beings dem weh placelessly perish widout a grave. As well might dem tablets deh stan inna di cave a Elephanta as yah.</p>
<p>Inna weh census a living creatures, di dead a mankind dem include; why it is dat a universal proverb seh bout dem, dat dem tell no tales, though dem contain more secrets dan di Goodwin Sands; how it is dat to him name weh yesterday departed fi di ada worl, wi prefix so significant an infidel a wod, an yet no thus entitle him, if him but embark fi di remotest Indies a dis living earth; why di Life Insurance Companies dem pay death-forfeitures pan immortals; inna weh eternal, unstirring paralysis, an deadly, hopeless trance, yet lay antique Adam weh ded sixty round centuries ago; how it is dat we still refuse fi be comforted fi dem who wi nevertheless maintain a dwelling inna unspeakable bliss; why all di living so strive fi hush all di dead; therefore but di rumor a knocking inna a tomb ago terrify a whole city. Aal a dem sitn de no av no miinin.</p>
<p>But Faith, like a jackal, feed among di tombs, an even fram dem dead doubts she gather har most vital hope.</p>
<p>It need fi be tell, wid weh feelings, pan di eve a one Nantucket voyage, mi did a regard dem marble tablets deh, an by di murky light a dat deh darkened, doleful day read di fate a di whalemen dem weh did gaan before mi. Yes, Ishmael, di same fate maita be fi yuh. But somehow mi grow merry again. Delightful inducements fi embark, fine chance fi promotion, it look like—aye, a stove boat ago mek mi an immortal by brevet. Yes, death deh inna dis business a whaling—a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling a man into Eternity. But weh den? Mi tink wi have hugely mistaken dis matter a Life an Death. Mi tink seh weh dem call mi shadow yah pan earth a mi true substance. Mi tink seh inna looking at tings spiritual, wi too much like oysters observing di sun thru di wata, an tink seh thick water di thinnest a air. Mi tink mi body a but di lees a mi better being. In fak tek mi badi uu ago, tek it mi se, a no mi. An so three cheers fi Nantucket; an come a stove boat an stove body wen dem waan, fi stave my soul, Jove himself can't.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00013">CHAPTER 8. Di Pulpit.</h2>
<p>Mi neva did a sidong so lang bifuor a man a wan sortn venerable robustness kom iin; immediately as di storm-pelted door fly back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing a him by all di congregation, sufficiently attested dat dis fine old man was di chaplain. Yes, a did di famous Fada Mapple, so di whalemen dem did call him, mongst whom him was a very great favourite. Im did a sailor an harpooneer inna im youth, but fi many years past im did dedicate im life to di ministry. At di time mi a write bout now, Fada Mapple did deh inna di hardy winta a one healthy old age; dat deh sort a old age weh look like a merge inna a secan flowering youth, fi mongst all di fissures a him wrinkles, deh did a shane certain mild gleams a one newly developing bloom—di spring verdure a peeping forth even unda February's snow. Nobadi weh did hear him history before, coulda fi di first time behold Father Mapple widout di utmost interest, cause deh did have certain engrafted clerical peculiarities bout him, imputable to dat adventurous maritime life him did led. Wen him enter mi observe seh him neva carry no umbrella, an certainly him neva come inna him carriage, cause him tarpaulin hat did a run dung wid melting sleet, an him great pilot cloth jacket did a look like him did a drag him to di floor wid di weight a di water weh it did absorb. However, hat an coat an overshoes dem did tek weh one by one, an dem did hang up inna a likkle space inna one adjacent corner; wen, arrayed inna a decent suit, him quietly approach di pulpit.</p>
<p>Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, an since a regular stairs to such a height woulda, by its long angle wid di floor, seriously contract di already small area a di chapel, di architect, it seemed, did act upon di hint a Father Mapple, an finish di pulpit widout a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side like dem weh did use inna lader a ship fram a boat at sea. Di wife a one whaling captain did provide di chapel wid a handsome pair a red worsted man-ropes fi dis ladder, weh, being itself nicely headed, an stained wid a mahogany colour, di whole contrivance, considering what manner a chapel it was, seem by no means in bad taste. Halting fi an instant at di foot a di ladder, an wid both han dem grab di ornamental knobs a di man-ropes, Faada Mapple cast a look upwards, an den wid a truly sailor-like but still reverencial dexterity, hand ova han, mount di steps as if ascending di main-top a him vessel.</p>
<p>Di perpendicular parts a dis side ladder, as is usually di case wid swinging ones, did a cloth-covered rope, only di rounds dem did a wood, so dat at every step deh did have a joint. At mi first glimpse a di pulpit, it neva escape mi seh however convenient fi a ship, dem joints inna di present instance did look unnecessary. For mi neva ready fi si Fada Mapple afta im get di height, slowly turn round, an stooping ova di pulpit, deliberately drag up di ladder step by step, til di whole did deposit widin, lef him impregnable inna him likkle Quebec.</p>
<p>Mi ponder some time widout fully comprehending di reason fi dis. Faada Mapple did enjoy such a wide reputation fi sincerity an sanctity, dat mi couldn't suspect him a courting notoriety by any mere tricks of di stage. No, mi did tink, it mus have some sober reason fi dis ting; furthermore, it haffi symbolize someting weh yuh nuh see. It can be, den, dat by dat deh act a physical isolation, him signify him spiritual withdrawal fi di time, fram all outward worldly ties an connexions? Yes, fi replenish wid di meat an wine a di wod, tu di faithful man a God, dis pulpit, mi si, a wan self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, wid a perennial wel a waata widin di waal dem.</p>
<p>But di side ladder was not di only strange feature a di place, borrowed fram di chaplain's former sea-farings. Between di marble cenotaphs pan either han a di pulpit, di wall weh did form it back did adorn wid a big painting weh did a represent a gallant ship weh did a beat against a terrible storm off a lee coast a black rocks an snowy breakers. But high above di flying scud an dark-rolling clouds, deh did a float a likkle isle a sunlight, fram weh did a beam out an angel's face; an dis bright face shed a distinct spot a radiance upon di ship's tossed deck, someting like dat deh silver plate now insert inna di Victory's plank weh Nelson did fall. “Ah, noble ship,” di angel did a seh, “beat on, beat on, yuh noble ship, an bear a hardy helm; cause lo! di sun a break through, di clouds a roll off—serenest azure deh deh deh.”</p>
<p>Nor was di pulpit itself widout a trace a di same sea-taste weh did achieve di ladder an di picture. It paneled front was inna di likeness a a ship's bluff bows, an di Holy Bible rest pan a projecting piece a scroll work, fashioned afta a ship's fiddle-headed beak.</p>
<p>Weh coulda be more full a meaning?—for di pulpit is ever dis earth's foremost part; all di rest come inna it rear; di pulpit lead di worl. Fram de so it a di storm a God's quick wrath weh dem fos get describe, an di bow haffi bear di earliest brunt. Fram de so it a di God a breezes fair or foul weh dem fos invoke fi favourable winds. Yes, di worl a one ship weh deh pan it passage out, an not a voyage complete; an di pulpit a it prow.</p>

<p>Faada Mapple get op, an inna a mild voice a unassuming authority, im order di scattered people dem fi condense. “Starboard gangway, deh! side away to larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”</p>
<p>A did a low rumbling a heavy sea-boots mongst di benches, an a still slighter shuffling a women's shoes, an all did quiet again, an every eye did deh pan di preacher.</p>
<p>Im pause a likkle; den kneeling inna di pulpit's bows, fold him big brown han dem across him chest, uplift him closed eyes, an offer a prayer so deeply devout dat him did look like him did a kneeling an praying at di bottom a di sea.</p>
<p>Dis end, inna prolonged solemn tones, like di continual tolling a one bell inna a ship weh a found at sea inna a fog—in such tones him staat read di following hymn; but change him manner towards di concluding stanzas, burst out wid a pealing exultation an joy—</p>
<div class="pgmonospaced">“Di ribs an di terror dem inna di whale,<br/> Arched ova mi a dismal gloom,<br/> While all God's sun-lit waves did a roll by,<br/> An lift mi deeping dung to doom.<br/><br/> “Mi si di opening maw a hell,<br/> Wid endless pains an sorrows deh;<br/> Weh nobadi but dem weh feel can tell—<br/> Oh, mi did a plonge to despair.<br/><br/> “Inna black distress, mi call mi God,<br/> Wen mi coulda scarce believe him mine,<br/> Him bow him ear to mi complaints—<br/> No more di whale did mi confine.<br/><br/> “Wid speed him fly to mi relief,<br/> As pan a radiant dolphin borne;<br/> Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone<br/> Di face a mi Deliverer God.<br/><br/> “Mi song fi eva shall record<br/> Dat deh terrible, dat deh joyful hour;<br/> Mi gi di priez tu mi Gad;<br/> Him all di mercy an di power.”<br/></div>
<p>Nearly all join inna singing dis hymn, weh did a swell high above di howling a di storm. A brief pause ensue; di preacher slowly turn ova di leaves a di Bible, an at last, folding him han dung pan di proper page, seh: “Beloved shipmates, clinch di last verse a di first chapter a Jonah—'An God did prepare a great fish fi swallow up Jonah.'”</p>
<p>“Shipmates, da buk ya, we av onggl fuo chapta iina Gad wod, a wan a di liklis sitn dem iina Gad wod. Bot di diip diip siil we Jonah rait, a wan lesn tu wi, da prafit ya a wan big lesn tu wi. grand!We sound wid him to di kelpy bottom a di <i>waters</i> an all di slime a di sea is bout wi! wi all, cause it a one story a di sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, di swift punishment, repentance, prayers, an finally di deliverance an joy a Jonah As wid all sinners among man, di sin a dis son a Amittai was inna him wilful disobedience a di command a God—never mind now weh him did find a command, or how hard him did conyed. command. But all di tings dem weh God woulda waan wi fi do a hard fi wi do—memba dat—an hence, him oftener command wi dan endeavors fi persuade. An if wi obey God, wi haffi disobey wiself, weh di hardness a obeying God consist.</p>
<p>“Wid dis sin a disobedience inna him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by seeking fi run weh fram Him. Him tink seh a ship weh man mek ago carry him go a country dem weh God nuh reign, but only di Captains dem pan dis ya earth. Im skulk roun di wharves a Joppa, an seek a ship weh a bound fi Tarshish, an him neva haid. meaning yah. By all accounts Tarshish coulda been no other city dan di modern Cadiz. An weh Cadiz deh inna Spain, fram Joppa, as Jonah coulda possibly did sail inna dem deh ancient days, wen di Atlantic was almost unnowmate, di Joppa. di most easterly coast a di Mediterranean, di Syrian; an Tarshish or Cadiz more dan two thousand miles to di westward fram dat, jus yuh no si den, shipmates, seh Jonah did a try fi run weh fram God? fram him God; prowling among di shipping like a vile burglar hastening fi cross di seas. So disordered, self-condemning is him look, dat if deh did have policemen inna dem days deh, Jonah, pan di mere suspicion a someting wrong, did get arrest ere him touch a deck, not a baggage, or-baggage! fren dem go wid him to di wharf wid dem adieux. At last, afta dem dodging search, him find di Tarshish ship a get di last items a har cargo; ease an confidence; inna vain essays him wretched smile. Strong intuitions of di man assure di mariners him cyaan be no inocent Inna dem gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to di other—“Jack, him rob a widow;” or, “Joe, yuh mark him; him a one bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, mi guess him a di adulterer weh break jail inna old Gomorrah, or belike, one a di missing murderers fram Sodom.” Wan neks wan ron fi riid di bil weh stie gens di spiil pan di waaf we di ship de pan, an a gi im faiv onjrid guol koin fi di ares a wan parricide, an wid wan diskripshan a im porsn. Jonah tremble, an summoning all him boldness to him face, only look so much di more a coward. Him naa go confess himself suspected; but dat itself a strong suspicion So him mek di bes a it;</p>
<p>“'A who deh deh?' di Captain baal out a him busy desk, a mek out him papers fi di Customs—'A who deh deh?' Oh! how dat harmless question mangles Jonah! Fi di instant him almost turn fi run weh again. But him rally 'How soon yuh sail?' So far di busy Captain neva look up to Jonah, though di man now stan up inna front; but no sooner him hear dat hollow voice, den him dart a scrutinizing glance 'We sail wid di next coming tide,' at last him slowly ansa, still intently eyeing him. Ha! Jonah, dat a anodda stab. But him swiftly call weh di Captain fram dat deh scent, 'Mi ago sail wid yuh,'—im seh,—'di passage money how much is dat?—Mi ago pay now.' For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it was a ting not to be overlooked inna dis history, 'dat him pay di fareof it' ere di craft did sail, dis is full a meaning.</p>
<p>“Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detect crime in any, but whose cupidity exposed it only in the penniless. Inna dis world, shipmates, sin weh pay its way can travel freely, an widout a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stop at all frontiers So Jonah's prepares fi di test dem. Jonah's purse, ere him judge him openly. Den di Captain know seh Jonah a one fugitive; counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, him mutters; an Jonah get put dung fi him passage, 'Point out mi state-room, Sir,' seh Jonah now, 'Mi travel-weary; 'Yuh look like it,' di Captain seh, 'yuh room deh deh.' Jonah go in, an woulda lock di door, but di lock neva have no key. Wen him hear him foolishly fumbling deh, di Captain laugh lowly to himself, an mutter someting bout di doors a di convicts' cells dem weh neva allow fi be lock widin All dress an dusty as him is, Jonah throw himself inna him bed-seling, almost resting. pan him forehead. Di air deh close, an Jonah gasps. Den, inna dat deh contracted hole, sunk, too, unda di ship's water-line, Jonah feel di heralding presentiment a dat deh stifling hour, wen di whale shall hold him inna di smallest a him bowels' wards.</p>
<p>“Screwed at its axis against di side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates inna Jonah's room; an di ship, heeling ova towards di wharf wid di weight a di last bales weh dem get, di lamp, flame an all, though inna slight motion, still maintain a permanent obliquity wid reference to di room, though, in truth, in truth, it mek itself straight; obvious di false, lying levels mongst which it did a hang. Di lamp alarm an frighten Jonah; conscience hang inna mi!' him groan, 'straight upwards, so it burn;</p>
<p>“Like one who afta a night a drunken revelry hies to him bed, still reeling, but wid conscience yet pricking him, as di plungings of di Roman race-horse but so much di more strike him steel tags inna him; as one who inna dat deh miserable plight still turn an turn in giddy anguish, praying God fi annihid paslation at di mid di bed; a woe him feel, a deep stupor steal ova him, as ova di man weh bleed to death, fi conscience a di wound, an nutten deh fi staunch it; so, afta sore wrestlings inna him berth, Jonah's prodigy a ponderous misery drag him drowning dung to sleep.</p>
<p>“An nou di taim fi di taid kom, di ship chruo aaf di kiebl dem, an fram di dezot waaf di uncheered ship fi Tarshish, aal a di ship dem, gliid tu di sii. Dat de ship, mi fren dem, a di fos a di rekaad smuuggl dem! Di kanchraband a did Jonah. Bot di sii rebel dem, im naa go bear di wikid boert, Wan staam a kom pan di staam. now wen di boatswain call all hands fi lighten har; wen di box dem, bales, an jars dem a clatter ovaboard; an likkle hears him or heeds di far rush a di mighty whale, weh even now wid open mout a cleave di seas afta him. yuh, O, sleeper!' Startled fram him lethargy by dat deh direful cry, Jonah staggers to him foot, an stumbling to di deck, grab a shroud, fi look out pan di sea But at dat moment deh him get spring upon by a panther billow weh a jump ova di bulwarks Wave afta wave thus leap inna di ship, an find no speed speed fi di mariners an come. nigh to drowning while yet float. An ever, as di white moon show har affrighted face fram di steep gullies inna di blackness ovahead, aghast Jonah sees di rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat dung again towards di tormented deep.</p>
<p>“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through him soul. In all him cringing attitudes, di God-fugitive is now too plainly known. Di sailors dem mark him; more an more certain grow dem suspicion a him, an at last, fully fi test di truth, by referring di whole matter to high Heaven, dem fall fi casting lots, fi see who was di greatest tempest. Jonah's; dat did discover, den how furiously dem mob him wid dem questions. Weh yuh come fram? unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by di hard hand a God weh deh pan him.</p>
<p>“'Mi a wan Iibruu,' im baal out—an den—'Mi fried a di Laad di Gad a evn we mek di sii an di jrai lan!' Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well mighta yuh fear di Lord God <i>den!</i> out inna di sea, cause him did know seh fi <i>him</i> sake dis great tempest did deh pan dem;</p>
<p>“An now behold Jonah tek up as an anchor an drop inna di sea, wen instantly a oily calmness float out fram di east, an di sea still, as Jonah carry dung di gale wid him, leving smooth water behind. Im go dung inna di whirling heart a such a masterless commotion dat him scarce drop di moment wen him sewning jawe a waiting him; an di whale shoots-to all him ivory teet, like so many white bolts, upon him prison. Den Jonah pray to di Lord outa di fish's belly. But observe him prayer, an laan a weighty lesson. deliverance to God, contenting himself wid dis, dat spite a all him pains an pangs, him will still look towards Him holy temple. An yahso, shipmates, is true an faithful repentance not clamorous fi pardon, but grateful fi punishment, is shown inna di eventual deliverance a him fram di Shipmates, weh mi no do. Jonah infronta yuh fi get copy fi him sin but mi put him infronta yuh as a model fi repent not sin;</p>
<p>While him did a talk dem words deh, di howling a di shrieking, slanting storm widout did a look like him did a add new power to di preacher, who, wen him did a describe Jonah's sea-storm, did a look like himself did a tosse by a storm. Him deep chest did a heave as wid a ground-swell; him tossed arms dem did look like di warring elements dem did a work; an di thunder dem weh did a roll weh fram off him swarthy brow, an di light weh did a jump fram him eye, mek all him simple hearers look pan him wid a quick fear weh did strange to dem.</p>
<p>Deh now come a lull inna him look, as him silently turn ova di leaves a di Book once more; an, at last, stan up motionless, wid closed eyes, fi di moment, seemed communing wid God an himself.</p>
<p>But again him lean ova towards di people, an bow him head lowly, wid a aspect a di deepest yet manliest humility, him seh dem words yah:</p>
<p>“Shipmates, God put only one han pan unu, him both press pan mi. Mi read unu by how murky light may be mine di lesson weh Jonah teach to all sinners, an so to unu, an still more to mi, cause mi a greater sinner dan unu. An now how gladly mi woulda come dung fram dis mast-head an sit deh pan di hatches weh yuh did a listen, an listen as yuh while some one a unu read <i>mi</i> dat deh ada an more awful lesson weh Jonah teach to <i>mi</i> , as a pilot a di living God How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true tings, an bidden by di Lord fi sound dem unwelcome truths inna di ears a one wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at di hostility weh him shuda raise fram him emission, sought fi run weh him. duty an him God by taking ship at Joppa. But God deh everyweh; Tarshish him neva reach. 'di weeds dem did wrap roun him head,' an all di watery world a woe did a bowl ova him. Yet even den beyond di reach a any plummet—'out of the belly of hell'—wen di whale did a ground pan di ocean's utmost bones, even den, God did hear di engulphed, repenting wen him did a criad fram di unturking; cold an blackness a di sea, di whale come breeching up towards di warm an pleasant sun, an all di delights a air an earth; wen di wod a di Laad kom a sekan taim;</p>
<p>“Dis, shipmates, dis a dat ada lesn; an woe tu di pailat a di livin Gad we slight it. Woe tu di wan we dis ya worl charm fram di Gud Nyuuz duty! Woe tu di wan we a luk fi puor ail pan di waata wen Gad don mek it iina wan gale! inna dis ya worl, courts no dishonor! Woe to him weh wouldn't be true, even though fi be false was salvation!</p>
<p>Im drop an fall weh fram imself fi a moment; den lift him face to dem again, show a deep joy inna him eyes, as him crie out wid a heavenly enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! pan di starboard han a every woe, deh deh a sure delight; an higher di top a dat deh delight, dan di bottom a di woe is deep. Is not di main-kel higher dan di lowson is to—leaight him? far, far upward, an inward delight—who against di proud gods an commodores a dis earth, ever stand forth him own inexorable self Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, wen di ship of dis base treacherous world is to him, who give no quarter inna di truth, an burn, an pluck out all from him. robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledge no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can neva shake from dis sure Keel of the eternal delight and who will be to him delight. lay him dung, can seh wid him last breath—O Faada!—chiefly known to mi by Thy rod—mortal or immortal, yahso mi did a strive fi be Yuh, more dan fi be dis world's, or fi mi own. Yet dis a nuh ting: Mi lef eternity to Thee;</p>
<p>Im seh no more, but slowly wave a benediction, cover im face wid im han dem, an so remain kneeling, til all di people dem did lef, an im did lef alone inna di place.</p>
