<h2 id="pgepubid00121">CHAPTER 114. Di Gilder.</h2>
<p>Penetrating further an further inna di heart a di Japanese cruising ground, di Pequod did soon all astir inna di fishery. Often, inna mild, pleasant weather, fi twelve, fifteen, eighteen, an twenty hours pan di stretch, dem did a engage inna di boats dem, steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling afta di whales, or fi an interlude a sixty or seventy minutes calmly waiting dem uprising; though wid but likkle success fi dem pains.</p>
<p>At such times, unda an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow heaving swells; sidong inna him boat, light as a birch canoe; an so sociably mixing wid di soft waves demself, dat like hearth-stone cats dem purr against di gunwale; dem a di times a dreamy quietude, wen yuh behold di tranquil beauty an brilliancy a di ocean's skin, yuh forget di tiger heart weh pants unda it; an wouldn't willingly memba, dat dis velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.</p>
<p>Dis a di times, wen inna him whale-boat di rover softly feel a certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards di sea; dat him regard it as so much flowery earth; an di distant ship weh did a show only di tops a har masts, look like it a struggle forward, not chruu high rolling waves, but chruu di tall grass a one rolling prairie: as wen di western emigrants dem horses only show dem erected ears, while dem hidden bodies widely wade through di amazing verdure.</p>
<p>Di long-drawn virgin vales; di mild blue hill-sides; as ova dem deh steal di hush, di hum; yuh almost swear seh play-wearied children lie sleeping inna dem solitudes, inna some glad May-time, wen di flowers a di woods dem pluck. An all dis mix wid yuh most mystic mood; so dat fact an fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, an form one seamless whole.</p>
<p>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if dem secret golden keys yah did look like dem did a open inna him him own secret golden treasuries, yet did him breath pan dem prove but tarnishing.</p>
<p>Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes inna di soul; inna yuh,—though long parched by di dead drought a di earthy life,—in yuh, man yet may roll, like young horses inna new morning clover; an fi some few fleeting moments, feel di cool dew a di life immortal pan dem. Would to God dem blessed calms yah woulda last. But di mixed, mingle threads a life dem woven by warp an woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm fi every calm. No steady unretracing progress nuh deh inna dis life; wi no advance chruu fixed gradations, an at di laas wan pause:—thru infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence's doubt (di common doom), den scepticism, den disbelief, resting at last inna manhood's pondering repose a If. But once wi go chuu, wi trace di round again; an dem a infant, bwoy, an man, an Ifs fi eva. Weh di final harbor deh, weh wi no unmoor no more? Inna weh rapt ether sail di worl, weh di weariest dem naa go eva weary? Weh di foundling faada hide? Wi soul dem a like dem orphan deh weh dem mada dem weh neva marid ded inna dem bear dem: di secret a wi paternity deh inna dem grave, an wi haffi deh deh fi laan it.</p>
<p>An dat deh same day, too, gazing far dung fram him boat's side inna dat deh same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—</p>
<p>“Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw inna him young bride's eye!—Not tell mi bout yuh teet-tiered sharks, an yuh kidnapping cannibal ways. Mek faith oust fact; mek fancy oust memory; mi look deep dung an do believe.”</p>
<p>An Stubb, fish-like, wid sparkling scales, leap up inna dat deh same golden light:—</p>
<p>“Mi a Stubb, an Stubb have him history; but yah Stubb tek oaths seh him always did jolly!”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00122">CHAPTER 115. Di Pequod Meets Di Bachelor.</h2>
<p>An jolly enough was di sights an di sounds dem weh did a come bearing dung before di wind, some few weeks afta Ahab's harpoon did welded.</p>
<p>A did a Nantucket ship, di Bachelor, weh did jus wedge inna har last cask a oil, an bolt dung har bursting hatches; an now, inna glad holiday apparel, did joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, a sailing round mongst di widely-separated ships dem pan di ground, before shi did a point har prow fi home.</p>
<p>Di three man dem at har mast-head did a wear long streamers a narrow red bunting at dem hat; fram di stern, a whale-boat did a suspended, bottom dung; an hanging captive fram di bowsprit was seen di long lower jaw a di last whale dem did slain. Signals, ensigns, an jacks a all colors did a fly fram har rigging, pan every side. Sideways lashed in each a har three basketed tops was two barrels a sperm; above which, inna har top-mast cross-trees, yuh si slender breakers a di same precious fluid; an nailed to har main truck was a brazen lamp.</p>
<p>As was afterwards learned, di Bachelor did meet wid di most surprising success; all di more wonderful, fi dat while cruising inna di same seas numerous ada vessels did gone entire months widout securing a single fish. Not only dem did gi weh barrels a beef an bread fi mek room fi di far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks dem did barter fi, fram di ship dem weh she did meet; an dem did stove along di deck, an inna di captain's an officers's state-rooms. Even di cabin table itself did get knock inna kindling-wood; an di cabin mess dine off di broad head a one oil-butt, lashed dung to di floor fi a centrepiece. Inna di forecastle, di sailors dem did actually caulk an pitch dem chest, an fill dem; it was humorously added, dat di cook did clap a head pan him largest boiler, an fill it; dat di steward did plug him spare coffee-pot an fill it; dat di harpooneers dem did head di sockets a dem irons an full dem; dat indeed everyting did full a sperm, except di captain's pantaloons pockets, an dem weh him did reserve fi thrust him han dem inna, inna self-complacent testimony a him entire satisfaction.</p>
<p>As dis glad ship a good luck bore dung upon di moody Pequod, di barbarian sound a enormous drums come fram har forecastle; an drawing still nearer, a crowd a har man dem did a stan up roun har huge try-pots, weh, cover wid di parchment-like <i>poke</i> or stomach skin a di black fish, did a gi forth a loud roar to every stroke a di clenched hands a di crew. Pan di quarter-deck, di mates an harpooneers dem did a dance wid di olive-hued girls dem weh did elope wid dem fram di Polynesian Isles; while suspended inna one ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between di foremast an mainmast, three Long Island negroes, wid glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, did a preside ova di hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others a di ship's company did tumultuously busy at di masonry a di try-works, fram weh di huge pots dem did tek weh. Yuh woulda almost tink dem did a pull dung di cursed Bastille, such wild cries dem did a raise, as di now useless brick an mortar did a get hurl inna di sea.</p>
<p>Lord an master ova all dis scene, di captain did stan up erect pan di ship's elevated quarter-deck, so dat di whole rejoicing drama did full before him, an did look like him did jus contrived fi him own individual diversion.</p>
<p>An Ahab, him too did a stan op pan him quarter-deck, shaggy an black, wid a stubborn gloom; an as di two ship dem cross each ada's wakes—one all jubilations fi tings passed, di other all forebodings as to tings to come—dem two captains inna demself impersonate di whole striking contrast a di scene.</p>
<p>“Come abord, come abord!” di gay Bachelor's commander baal out, a lif op a glaas an a botel inna di ier.</p>
<p>“Yuh si di White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.</p>
<p>“Nuo, mi onggl ier bout im, bot no biliiv iina im at aal,” di ada wan se wid nof pien. “Come abord!”</p>
<p>“Yuh too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any man?”</p>
<p>“Not enough fi taak bout—two islanders, dat's all;—but come abord, old hearty, come along. Mi ago soon tek dat deh black fram yuh brow. Come along, will ye (merry's di play); a full ship an homeward-bound.”</p>
<p>“How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; den loud, "Yuh a one full ship an homeward bound, yuh seh; well, den, call mi an empty ship, an outward-bound. So go yuh ways, an mi ago mine. Forward deh! Set all sail, an keep har to di wind!"</p>
<p>An so, while di one ship did a go cheerly before di breeze, di nex one stubbornly did a fight against it; an so di two vessels dem break; di crew a di Pequod a look wid grave, lingering glances towards di receding Bachelor; but di Bachelor's man dem neva did a heeding dem gaze fi di lively revelry dem did deh inna. An as Ahab, weh did a lean ova di taffrail, did a look pan di homeward-bound craft, him tek fram him pocket a likkle vial a sand, an den look fram di ship to di vial, an him did a look like dem did a bring two remote associations tugeda, fi dat deh vial did full a Nantuck sounds.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00123">CHAPTER 116. Di Dying Whale.</h2>
<p>Not seldom inna dis life, wen, pan di right side, fortune's favorites sail close by wi, wi, though all adroop before, catch somewhat a di rushing breeze, an joyfully feel wi bagging sails fill out. So it did look wid di Pequod. Fi di neks day afta dem did encounter di gay Bachelor, dem did si whales an four did get slain; an one a dem by Ahab.</p>
<p>It did far dong di aftanuun; an wen all di spearings a di crimson fight did done: an floating inna di lovely sunset sea an sky, sun an whale both stilly dead together; den, such a sweetness an such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up inna dat deh rosy air, dat it almost did look like far ova fram di deep green convent valleys a di Manilla isles, di Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, did gone to sea, freighted wid dem vesper hymns deh.</p>
<p>Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who did stern off fram di whale, did a sidong intently watching him final wanings fram di now tranquil boat. Fi dat strange spectacle weh yuh can observe inna all sperm whales dem a dead—di turning sunwards a di head, an so expiring—dat strange spectacle, beheld a such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.</p>
<p>“Im turn an turn him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, him homage-rendering an invoking brow, wid him last dying motions. Him too worship fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of di sun!—Oh dat dem too-favouring eyes shuda see dem too-favouring sights yah! beyond all hum a human weal or woe; det whirl roun di corpse, an it head some other way.</p>
<p>“Oh, yuh dark Hindoo half a nature, who a drowned bones yuh build yuh separate throne somwe inna di heart a dem unverdured seas yah; yuh a one infidel, yuh queen, an yuh too truly a taak to mi inna di wide-slaughter Typhoon, an di hushed burial a it afta Northy don turn weh him ded. head, an den gone round again, widout a lesson to mi.</p>
<p>“Oh, trebly hooped an welded hip a power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed jet!—dat one strivest, dis one jettest all in vain! In vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings wid yon all-quickening sun, dat only call out life, but give it not again. Yet dost thou, darker, rocker, prouder wid a half if mi darker faith. All thy unname imminglings float unda mi yah; mi a buoyed by breaths of once living tings, exhaled as air, but water now.</p>
<p>“Den hail, fi eva hail, O sea, inna whose eternal tossings di wild fowl find dem only rest. Born pan earth, but sucked by di sea; though hill an valley mother mi, unu billows a mi foster-breddas!”</p>

<p>Di four whales dem weh dem did kill dat deh evening did dead wide apart; one, far to windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. Dem last three deh did bring dem alongside ere nightfall; but di windward one couldn't reach til morning; an di boat weh did kill it did deh by it all night; an da buot de a did fi Ehab.</p>
<p>Di waif-pole did thrust upright inna di dead whale's spout-hole; an di lantern weh did a hangl fram it tap, did a cast a troubled flickering glare pan di black, glossy back, an far out pan di midnight waves, weh did a chafe di whale's broad flank, like soft surf pan a beach.</p>
<p>Ahab an all him boat's crew did look like dem did a sleep but di Parsee; weh did a crouch inna di bow, did a sidong a watch di shark dem, weh did a play roun di whale, an did a tap di light cedar planks wid dem tail. A sound like di moaning inna squadrons ova Asphaltites a unforgiven ghosts a Gomorrah, did a run shiddle thru di air.</p>
<p>Startin fram him slumbers, Ahab, face to face, si di Parsee; an hooped round by di gloom a di night dem did look like di last man dem inna a flooded world. “Mi did a dream it again,” him seh.</p>
<p>“Of di hearses? Mi neva seh, old man, seh neither hearse nor coffin can be owne?”</p>
<p>“An who dem ier seh ded pan di sii?”</p>
<p>“Bot mi se, uol man, dat bifuo yu kuda ded pan dis voyage, yu afi si tuu ded kyaas pan di sii; di fos wan no mek bai mortal han; an di visible wud a di laas wan afi gruo ina Merika.”</p>
<p>“Aye, aye! a strange sight dat, Parsee:—a hearse an it plumes a float ova di ocean wid di waves fi di pall-bearers. Ha! Such a sight we naa go soon see.”</p>
<p>“Biliiv it ar nat, yu kyaahn ded til yu si it, uol man.”</p>
<p>“An weh dat did a seh bout yuhself?”</p>
<p>“Though it come to di last, mi ago still go before yuh yuh pilot.”</p>
<p>“An wen yuh so gone before—if dat eva happen—den ere mi can follow, yuh haffi still appear to mi, fi pilot mi still?—Was it so? Well, den, did mi believe all yuh seh, oh mi pilot! Mi have yah two pledges dat mi shall yet slay Moby Dick an survive it.”</p>
<p>“Tek anodda pledge, old man,” di Parsee seh, as him eyes dem light up like fire-flies inna di gloom—“Hemp only can kill yuh.”</p>
<p>“Di gallows, yuh mean.—Mi a immortal den, pan lan an pan sii,” Ahab baal out, wid a laaf a derision;—“Immortal pan lan an pan sii!”</p>
<p>Dem both did silent again, as one man. Di grey dawn come on, an di slumbering crew get op fram di boat's bottom, an ere noon di dead whale dem bring to di ship.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00125">CHAPTER 118. Di Quadrant.</h2>
<p>Di season fi di Line at length did a come near; an every day wen Ahab, coming fram him cabin, cast him eyes aloft, di vigilant helmsman woulda ostentatiously handle him spokes, an di eager mariners quickly run to di braces, an woulda stan deh wid all dem eyes centrally fixed pan di nailed doubloon; impatient fi di order fi point di ship's prow fi di equator. Inna good time di order come. It did hard pan high noon; an Ahab, sidong inna di bows a him high-hoisted boat, did a tek him wonted daily observation a di sun fi determine him latitude.</p>
<p>Now, inna dat deh Japanese sea, di days inna summer a as freshets a effulgences. Dat deh unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems di blazing focus a di glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass. Di sky look lacquered; clouds deh deh; di horizon float; an dis nakedness a unrelieved radiance is as di insufferable splendours a God's throne. Well dat Ahab's quadrant did furnished wid colored glasses, through which yuh can tek sight a dat deh solar fire. So, swinging him seated form to di roll a di ship, an wid him astrological-looking instrument place to him eye, him remain inna dat deh posture fi some moments fi catch di precise instant wen di sun shuda gain its precise meridian. Meantime while him whole attention did a absorb, di Parsee did a kneel unda him pan di ship's deck, an wid face throw up like Ahab's, did a eyeing di same sun wid him; only di lids a him eyes did half hooded dem orbs, an him wild face did subdue to an earthly passionlessness. At length di desired observation did tek; an wid him pencil pan him ivory leg, Ahab soon calculate weh him latitude mus be at dat deh precise instant. Den wen him did a fall inna a moment's revery, him again look up towards di sun an murmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high an mighty Pilot! yuh tell mi truly weh mi <i>deh</i> —but yuh can cast di least hint weh mi <i>a go</i> be? Or can yuh tell weh some other ting besides mi deh dis moment? eyeing him. Dem eyes a mi look inna di very eye weh a even now beholding him; aye, an inna di eye weh a even now equally beholding di objects dem pan di unknown, thither side a yuh, yuh sun!”</p>
<p>Den gazing at him quadrant, an handling, one afta di ada, its numerous cabalistical contrivances, him pondered again, an muttered: “Foolish toy! babies' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and Captains; di world brags of you, of thy cunning and power; but weh afta all yuh can do, but tell di poor, point, piutiful yuh happen fi deh pan dis wide planet, an di han weh a hold yuh: no! vividness but scorches him, as dem old eyes deh even now scorched wid thy light, O sun! Level by nature to dis earth's horizon are di glances a man's eyes not shot fram di crown a him head, as if God did mean him fi gaze pan him firmament Curse yuh, yuh quadrant!” dashing it to di deck, “no longer I will guide mi earthly way by thee; di level ship's compass, an di level dead-reckoning, by log an by line; <i>dem yah</i> ago conduct mi, an show mi mi place pan di sea. Aye,” lighting fram di boat to di deck, “thus mi trample pan yuh, yuh paltry point pan dat I split thus; mash op yuh!”</p>
<p>As di frantic old man did a taak an a trample wid him live an dead foot dem, a sneering triumph weh did look like meant fi Ahab, an a fatalistic despair weh did look like meant fi himself—dem pass ova di mute, motionless Parsee's face. Unobserved him rise an glide weh; while, awestruck by di aspect a dem commander, di seamen dem clustered tugeda pan di forecastle, til Ahab, troubledly pacing di deck, shout out—“To di braces! Up helm!—square in!”</p>
<p>Inna wan instant di yards swing round; an as di ship half-wheeled pan har heel, har three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised pan har long, ribbed hull, seemed as di three Horatii pirouetting pan one sufficient steed.</p>
<p>Stan op bitwiin di nait-hed dem, Starbuck wach di Pequod's tumultuous wie, an Ahab's tu, az im go lurching lang di deck.</p>
<p>“Mi did sidong infronta di dense coal fire an watch it all aglow, full a it tormented flaming life; an mi did si it wane at last, dung, dung, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! a all dis fiery life a yuh, weh ago at length remain but one likkle heap a ashes!”</p>
<p>“Aye,” Stubb baal out, “but sea-coal ashes—mind yuh dat, Mr. Starbuck—sea-coal, not yuh common charcoal. Well, well; mi hear Ahab mutter, 'Here some one thrust dem cards inna dem old hands a mi; swear seh mi haffi play dem, an no others.' An damn mi, Ahab, but yuh act right;</p>

<p>Warmest climes but nurse di cruelest fangs: di tiger a Bengal crouches inna spiced groves a ceaseless verdure. Skies di most effulgent but basket di deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes weh neva swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, dat inna dem resplendent Japanese seas di mariner encounter di direst a all storms, di Typhoon. It will sometimes burst fram out dat deh cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed an sleepy town.</p>
<p>Towards evening a dat deh day, di Pequod did get torn a har canvas, an bare-poled did lef fi fight a Typhoon weh did hit har directly ahead. Wen darkness come on, sky an sea did a roar an split wid di thunder, an blaze wid di lightning, weh did a show di disabled masts dem a flatter yah an deh wid di rags dem weh di first fury a di tempest did lef fi it afta sport.</p>
<p>Holding by a shroud, Starbuck did a stan op pan di quarter-deck; at every flash a di lightning glancing aloft, fi si weh additional disaster mighta befallen di intricate hamper deh; while Stubb an Flask did a direct di man dem inna di higher hoisting an firmer lashing a di boats dem. But all a dem pain did look nutten. Though lifted to di very top a di cranes, di windward quarter boat (Ahab's) neva escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against di reeling ship's high teetering side, stove inna di boat's bottom at di stern, an lef it again, all dripping through like a sieve.</p>
<p>“Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” seh Stubb, regarding di wreck, “but di sea ago have it way. Stubb, fi one, cyaan fight it. Yuh see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave have such a great long start before it leap, all round di world it run, an den come di spring! But as fi mi, all di start mi haffi net fi mi net, but never deh yah. mind; it all inna fun: so di ole song seh;”—( <i>sings</i> .)</p>
<div class="pgmonospaced">Awo! jolly is di gale,<br/> An a joker is di whale,<br/> A' flourishin' him tail,—<br/> Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is di Ocean, oh!<br/><br/> Di scud all a flyin',<br/> Dat a him flip only foamin';<br/> Wen him stir inna di spicin',—<br/> Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is di Ocean, oh!<br/><br/> Tonda split di ship dem,<br/> But him only smack him lips,<br/> A tastin' a dis flip,—<br/> Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is di Ocean, oh!<br/></div>
<p>“Avast Stubb,” Starbuck baal out, “mek di Typhoon sing, an strike him harp yah inna wi rigging; but if yuh a brate man yuh wi hold yuh peace.”</p>
<p>"Bot mi a no no brait man; mi neva se mi a brait man; mi a kowad; an mi sing fi kip op mi spirit. An mi tel yu wa it miin, Mista Starbuck, no wie no de fi stap mi sing ina dis ya worl bot fi kot mi chruot. An wen dat don, ten tu wan mi sing yu di doxology fi a wind-op."</p>
<p>“Madman! look thru mi eyes if yuh have none a yuh own.”</p>
<p>“Weh! how yuh can see betta a dark night dan anybody else, neva mind how foolish?”</p>
<p>"Yah so!" Starbuck baal out, a tek Stubb bai di shuolda, an a shuo im an tuwaadz di weda bow, “yu no maak se di briiz a kom fram di iis, di siem kuos we Ahab a fi ron fi Moby Dick? di siem kuos we im swing tu dis die nait? nou maak im buot de; we dat de stov de? Ina di stern-shiet, we im a-go tan; man! Now jump ovaboard, an sing weh, if yuh haffi!</p>
<p>“Mi nuh half andastan yuh: weh deh inna di wind?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, round di Cape of Good Hope a di shortest way to Nantucket,” Starbuck seh suddenly, heedless a Stubb's question. “Di gale weh a hammer at wi now fi stave wi, wi can turn it inna a fair wind weh ago drive wi towards home. Yonder, to windward, all a blackness a doom; but to leeward, homeward—mi see it lighten up deh; but not wid di lightning.”</p>
<p>At dat deh moment inna one a di intervals a profound darkness, following di flashes, a voice did hear at him side; an almost at di same instant a volley a thunder peals roll ovahead.</p>
<p>“A who deh deh?”</p>
<p>“Old Thunder!” seh Ahab, groping him way along di bulwarks to him pivot-hole; but suddenly find him path mek plain to him by elbowed lances of fire.</p>
<p>Now, as di lightning rod to a spire pan shore is intended fi carry off di perilous fluid inna di soil; so di kinred rod weh at sea some ships carry to each mast, is intended fi conduct it inna di water. But as dis conductor haffi descend to considerable depth, dat its end may avoid all contact wid di hull; an as more, if dem keep it constantly towing deh, it woulda be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a likkle wid some a di rigging, an more or less impeding di vessel's way inna di water; because a all dis, di lower parts a di ship's lightning-rods dem nuh always deh ovaboard; but dem generally mek inna long slender links, so as fi be di more readily hauld up inna di chains outside, or throw dung inna di sea, as occasion may require.</p>
<p>“Di rod dem! di rod dem!” cried Starbuck to di crew, suddenly admonished to vigilance by di vivid lightning weh did jus a darting flambeaux, fi light Ahab to him post. “Dem ovaboard? drop dem ova, fore an aft. Quick!”</p>
<p>“Avast!” Ahab did a baal out; “mek wi have fair play yah, though we be di weaker side. Yet mi ago contribute fi raise rods pan di Himmalehs an Andes, dat all di world may be secure; but out pan privileges! Mek dem be, sir.”</p>
<p>“Luk op!” Starbuck baal out. “Di corpusants! di corpusants!”</p>
<p>All di yard-arms dem did tip wid a pallid fire; an touch at each tri-pointed lightning-rod-end wid three tapering white flames, each a di three tall masts dem did a burn silently inna dat deh sulphurous air, like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.</p>
<p>“Blast di boat! mek it go!” Stubb baal out at dis instant, as a swashing sea heave up unda him own likkle craft, so dat its gunwale violently jam him han, as him did a pass a lashing. “Blast it!”—but sliping backward pan di deck, him uplifted eyes ketch di flames; an him shift him tone siem taim him baal out—“Di corpusants dem have mercy pan wi all!”</p>
<p>Fi sailors, oaths a household words; dem ago swear inna di trance a di calm, an inna di teet a di tempest; dem ago imprecate curses fram di topsail-yard-arms, wen most a dem teeter ova to a seething sea; but inna all mi voyagings, seldom mi hear a common oath wen God's burning finger have been laid pan di ship; wen Him “Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin” did woven inna di shrouds an di cordage.</p>
<p>While dis pallidness did a burn aloft, few words did hear fram di enchanted crew; weh inna one thick cluster did a stan up pan di forecastle, all dem eyes a gleaming inna dat deh pale phosphorescence, like a far away constellation a stars. Relieved against di ghostly light, di gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice him real stature, an seemed di black cloud fram weh di thunder did come. Di parted mout a Tashtego did a show him shark-white teet dem, weh did a strangely gleamed as if dem too did get tip by corpusants; while lit up by di preternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames pan him body.</p>
<p>Di tableau all waned at last wid di pallidness aloft; an once more di Pequod an every soul pan har decks did wrap inna a pall. A moment or two pass, wen Starbuck, going forward, push against some one. A did Stubb. “Weh yuh tink now, man, mi hear yuh cry; it neva di same ting inna di song.”</p>
<p>“No, no, it neva; mi seh di corpusants dem have mercy pan wi all; an mi hope dem will, still. But dem only have mercy pan long faces?—dem have no bowels fi a laugh? An look yuh, Mr. Starbuck—but it too dark fi look. Hear mi, den: Mi tek dat deh mast-head flame weh wi did si fi a sign a luck fi dem masts deh weh hold inna a rock; a go be chock a' block wid sperm-oil, d'ye see; an so, all dat sperm ago work up inna di masts, like sap inna a tree Yes, wi three masts ago still be as three spermaceti candles—dat a di good promise we did si.”</p>
<p>At dat deh moment Starbuck ketch sight a Stubb's face slowly staatin fi glimmer inna sight. Im look op an baal out: “Si! si!” an once more di high tapering flames dem did beheld wid weh did look like doubled supernaturalness inna dem pallor.</p>
<p>“Di corpusants dem have mercy pan wi all,” Stubb baal out, agen.</p>
<p>At di base a di mainmast, full unda di doubloon an di flame, di Parsee did a kneel inna Ahab front, but wid him head bow weh fram him; while near by, fram di arched an overhanging rigging, weh dem did jus been engaged securing a spar, a numba a di seamen dem, arrested by di glare, now cohered tugeda, an hang pendulous, like a knot a numbed wasps fram a drooping, orchard twig. Inna various enchanted attitudes, like di standing, or stepping, or running skeletons inna Herculaneum, others did remain rooted to di deck; but all dem eyes upcast.</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, man!” Ahab baal out. “Look up pan it; mark it well; di white flame but light di way to di White Whale! Hand mi dem mainmast links deh; mi woulda fain feel dis pulse, an mek mine beat against it; blood against fire! So.”</p>
<p>Den turning—di laas link weh did a hold fast inna him left han, him put him foot pan di Parsee; an wid fixed upward eye, an high-flung right arm, him did a stan up erect before di lofty tri-pointed trinity a flames.</p>
<p>“Oh! yuh clear spirit a clear fire, weh pan dem seas yah mi as Persian once did worship, til inna di sacramental act so burn by yuh, dat to dis hour mi bear di scar; mi now know yuh, yuh clear spirit, an mi now know seh yuh right worship a defiance. To neither love nor reverence yuh wilt be kind an but yuh can kill; an all dem get kill. No fearless fool now deh front yuh. but to di last gasp a mi earthquake life ago dispute it unconditional, unintegral mastery inna mi. di queenly personality live inna mi, an feel har royal rights. Come inna yuh lowest form a love, an mi ago kneel an kiss yuh; fire yuh mek mi, an like a true pikni a fire, mi breath it back to yuh.”</p>
<p>[ <i>Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; di nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice dem previous height; Ahab, wid di res, close him eyes, him right han press hard pan dem.</i> ]</p>
<p>“Mi own yuh speechless, placeless power; mi neva seh so? Nor it was wrung fram mi; nor mi no drop dem links yah now. Yuh can blind; but mi can den grope. Yuh can consume; but mi can den be ashes. Tek di homage a dem poor eyes, an shutter-hands. Mi wouldn't tek it. Di lightning flashes thru mi skullball an micheche; uol iip a biitn brain luk laik se shi a go hed, an a ruol pan som stuonin grong. Aal, oh! Bot stil blain, mi wi taak tu yu. Lait duo yu a jrap outa daaknis; bot mi daaknis a jrap outa di lait, a jrap outa yu! Di jevlin siiz; uopn yai; si, ar nat? Dem bon op di faiya! Aal, yu magnanimos! awre Mi du gluori ina mi jinarieshan. Bot yu a faada faada; mi swiit mada, mi no nuo. Aal, kruwil! wa yu av wid ar? A di pozzle de de; bot chobl fi yu grieta. Unu no nuo ou kom aredi, so laik yu, an no biliiv iina Gad. siem wie nuo unu biginin, so it kaal dem kaals kaals kaals. Mi nuo se aal bout mi, we yu nuo . not a yuhself, oh, yuh omnipotent. Yuh have some unsuffusing ting beyond yuh, yuh clear spirit, to whom all yuh eternity is but time, all yuh creativeness mechanical Through yuh, yuh flaming self, mi scorched eyes do dimly see it. unparticipated grief. Yahso again wid haughty agony, mi read mi faada.</p>
<p>“Di boat! di boat!” Starbuck baal out, “luk pan yu buot, uol man!”</p>
<p>Ahab's harpoon, di one weh dem did forge at Perth's fire, did stay firmly lashed inna it conspicuous crotch, so dat it did a project beyond him whale-boat's bow; but di sea weh did stove it bottom did mek di loose leather sheath drop off; an fram di keen steel barb deh now come a leveled flame a pale, forked fire. As di silent harpoon did a bon deh like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grab Ahab by di arm—“God, God is against yuh, old man; forbear! 'tis an ill voyage! ill began, ill continued; mek mi square di yards, while wi may, old man, an mek a fair wind a it homeward, to go pan a voyage beta dan dis voyage.”</p>
<p>Wen dem hear Starbuck, di panic-stricken crew instantly run to di braces—though not a sail neva lef aloft. Fi di moment all di aghast mate's thoughts did a look fi dem; dem raise a half mutinous cry. But dashing di rattling lightning links to di deck, an snatching di burning harpoon, Ahab wave it like a torch mongst dem; swearing fi transfix wid it di first sailor weh but cast loose a rope's end. Petrified by him aspect, an still more shrinking fram di fiery dart weh him did a hold, di man dem fall back inna dismay, an Ahab again speke:—</p>
<p>“All yuh oaths fi hunt di White Whale dem binding as mine; an heart, soul, an body, lungs an life, old Ahab is bound. An dat yuh can know to which tune dis heart beat; look yuh yah; so mi blow out di last fear!” An wid one blast a him breath him out di flame.</p>
<p>As inna di hurricane weh sweep di plain, man fly di neighborhood a some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height an strength but render it so much di more unsafe, cause so much di more a mark fi thunderbolts; so at dem last words a Ahab's plenty a di mariners dem run weh fram him inna a terror a dismay.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00130">CHAPTER 123. Di Musket.</h2>
<p>Durin di most violent shocks a di Typhoon, di man at di Pequod's jaw-bone tiller did get reelingly hurled to di deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles did attached to it—fi dem did slack—cause some play to di tiller was indispensable.</p>
<p>Inna a severe gale like dis, while di ship is jus a tossed shuttlecock to di blast, it is by no means uncommon fi see di needles inna di compasses, at intervals, go round an round. It was so wid di Pequod's; at almost every shock di helmsman neva fail fi notice di whirling velocity wid which dem did a revolve pan di cards; it a one sight weh hardly anyone can behold widout some sort a unwonted emotion.</p>
<p>Some hours afta midnight, di Typhoon abate so much, dat chruu di strenuous exertions a Starbuck an Stubb—one engaged forward an di ada aft aft—di shivered remnants a di jib an fore an main-top-sails dem did cut adrift fram di spars, an go eddying weh to leeward, like di feaths a anbat dem, weh sometimes dem did a cast to wid dat deh storm-tossed bird deh pan di wing.</p>
<p>Di three corresponding new sails dem did bent an reefed now, an a storm-trysail did set further aft; so dat di ship soon go chruu di wata wid some precision again; an di course—fi di present, East-south-east—we him did fi steer, if practicable, did once more given to di helmsman. For during di violence a di gale, him did only steer according to its vicissitudes. But as him did a bring di ship as near har course as possible, watching di compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! di wind did a come roun astern; aye, di foul breeze did become fair!</p>
<p>Instantly di yards dem did square, to di lively song a “ <i>Ho! di fair wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!</i> ” di crew did a sing fi joy, dat so promising an event shuda so soon did falsify di evil portents weh did a preceding it.</p>
<p>In compliance wid di standing order a him commander—fi report immediately, an at any one a di twenty-four hours, any decided change inna di affairs a di deck,—Starbuck did no sooner trim di yards to di breeze—however reluctantly an gloomily,—dan him mechanically go below fi apptain Captainabrise a di circumstance.</p>
<p>Ere knocking at him state-room, him involuntarily pause before it a moment. Di cabin lamp—taking long swings dis way an dat—did a burn fitfully, an a casting fitful shadows pan di ole man's bolted door,—a thin one, wid fixed blinds inserted, in place a upper panels. Di isolated subterraneousness a di cabin mek a certain humming silence fi reign deh, though it did hoop round by all di roar a di elements. Di loaded muskets inna di rack did shinely reveal, as dem did a stan up upright against di forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but outa Starbuck's heart, at dat instant wen him see di muskets, deh strangely evolve an evil thought; but so blent wid it neutral or good accompaniments dat fi di instant him hardly know it fi itself.</p>
<p>“Im woulda shot mi once,” him murmured, “yes, deh deh di very musket weh him point at mi;—dat one wid di studded stock; mek mi touch it—lift it. Strange, dat mi, weh have handle so many deadly lances, strange, dat mi shuda shake so now. Loaded? Mi haffi see. Aye, aye; Best spill it?—wait. Mi ago hold di musket boldly while mi tink.—Mi come fi report a fair <i>wind</i> to <i>him</i> . yah; him woulda kill mi wid di very ting weh mi handle now.—Aye an him woulda fain kill all him crew. Im neva dash him heavenly quadrant an inna dem same perilous seas, gropes him neva have him way by mere dead reckounding of di error inna dis very no swear? lightning-rods? But shall dis crazed old man be tamely suffered fi drag a whole ship's company dung to doom wid him?—Yes, it woulda mek him di willful murderer a thirty man an more, if dis ship come to any deadly harm, an come to deadly harm, mi soul swears dis ship woulda, Aabh, den him did put inna dis way. asaid, dat de kraim wudn bi fi im. Ha! im a muuv iina im sliip? Yes, jos de de,—ina de, im a sliip. Sliip? eye, bot stil alaiv, ahn suun wiek agen. Mi kyaan tan op chrang wid yu, den, uol man. No riizn; no rimonschrieshan; no entatienment yu a go ierkyn tu; aal a dis yu a skoors. Flat obie tu yu uona flat . commands, dis a all yuh breath. Ye'st di man dem vow'd yuh vow; say'st all a wi a Ahabs. No lawful way?—Mek him a prisoner fi get tek home? even; knotted all over wid ropes and hawsers; him woulda be more hideous dan a caged tiger, den I couldn't possibly fly him howlings, sleep itself, inestimable reason woulda lef mi inna di hondreds remains, den? weh, an lock Japan di nearest. Mi stan alone yah upon an open sea, wid two oceans an a whole continent between mi an law.—Aye, aye, 'tis so.—Is heaven a murderer wen its lightning strike a would-be murderer inna him bed, tindering sheets an skin together?—And woulda mi be a murderer, den, and slowly, and slowly” half sideways looking, him put di loaded musket's end against di door.</p>
<p>“Pan dis level, Ahab's hammock swing widin; him head dis way. A touch, an Starbuck may survive fi hug him wife an child again.—Oh Mary! Mary!—boy! boy! boy!—But if mi wake yuh not to death, old man, who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck's body may sink all dis week, Great God crew wid! yuh? Shall I?—Di wind don go dung an shift, sir;</p>
<p>“Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, mi clutch yuh heart at last!”</p>
<p>Such a di sounds dem weh did a come hurtling fram outa di uol man tormented sleep, as if Starbuck's voice did a cause di long dumb dream fi speak.</p>
<p>Di yet leveled musket did a shake like a drunkard's arm against di panel; Starbuck did a wrestling wid an angel; but turn fram di door, him put di death-tube inna it rack, an lef di place.</p>
<p>“Im too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go dung, an wake him, an tell him. Mi haffi see to di deck yah. Yuh know weh fi seh.”</p>
