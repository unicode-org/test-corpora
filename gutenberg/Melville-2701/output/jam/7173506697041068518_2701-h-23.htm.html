<h2 id="pgepubid00131">CHAPTER 124. Di Needle.</h2>
<p>Next maanin di not-yet-subsided sea roll inna long slow billows a mighty bulk, an striving inna di Pequod's gurgling track, push har on like giants's palms outspread. Di strong, unstaggering breeze did a bound so, dat sky an air did look vast outbellying sails; di whole worl boom before di wind. Muffled inna di full morning light, di invisible sun was only known by di spread intensity a him place; weh him bayonet rays did a move on inna stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned ova everyting. Di sea did like a crucible a molten gold, weh bubblingly leap wid light an heat.</p>
<p>Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stan op apart; an every time di tetering ship loweringly pitch dung har bowsprit, him turn fi eye di bright sun's rays weh did a produce ahead; an wen she profoundly settle by di stern, him turn behind, an si di sun's rearward place, an how di same yellow rays did a blend wid him undeviating wake.</p>
<p>“Ha, ha, mi ship! yuh coulda well be taken now fi di sea-chariot a di sun. Ho, ho! all unu nations before mi prow, mi bring di sun to unu! Yoke pan di further billows; hallo! a tandem, mi drive di sea!”</p>
<p>But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, him hurried towards di helm, huskily demanding how di ship did a head.</p>
<p>“East-sou-east, sir,” di frightened steersman seh.</p>
<p>“Yuh lie!” smiting him wid him clenched fist. “Heading East at dis hour inna di morning, an di sun astern?”</p>
<p>Pan dis every soul did confound; fi di phenomenon weh Ahab did observe did unaccountably escape every one else; but it very blinding palpableness mus been di cause.</p>
<p>Thrusting him head half way inna di binnacle, Ahab ketch one glimpse a di compasses; him uplifted arm slowly fall; fi a moment him did almost look like him did a stagger. Staan behind him Starbuck look, an lo! di two compasses dem did a point East, an di Pequod did a go West.</p>
<p>But ere di fos wild alarm coulda get out abroad mongst di crew, di old man wid a rigid laugh exclaimed, “Mi have it! It don happen before. Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder turn wi compasses—dat's all. Yuh have before now hear bout such a ting, mi tek it.”</p>
<p>“Aye; but neva before it happen to mi, sa,” di pale mate seh, gloomily.</p>
<p>Yahso, it haffi seh, dat accidents like dis have inna more dan one case occur to ships inna violent storms. Di magnetic energy, as developed inna di mariner's needle, is, as all know, essentially one wid di electricity beheld inna heaven; so it no fi be much marveled at, dat such tings shuda happen. Instances weh di lightning did actually struck di vessel, so as fi smite dung some a di spars an rigging, di effect pan di needle did at times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so dat di before magnetic steel neva have no more use dan an old wife's knitting needle. But inna either case, di needle neva again, a itself, recover di original virtue thus marred or lost; an if di binnacle compasses dem be affected, di same fate reach all di others weh may be inna di ship; even did di lowermost one insert inna di kelson.</p>
<p>Deliberately standing before di binnacle, an eyeing di transpointed compasses, di old man, wid di sharp a him extended han, now tek di precise bearing a di sun, an satisfied seh di needles dem did exactly inverted, shout out him orders fi di ship's course fi be change accordingly. Di yaad dem did haad op; an once more di Pequod thrust har undaunted bows inna di opposing wind, fi di supposed fair one did only a juggle har.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whatever was him own secret thoughts, Starbuck neva seh notn, but quietly him issue all requisite orders; while Stubb an Flask—who in some small degree did look like dem did a share him feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As fi di man dem, though some a dem lowly rumbled, dem fear a Ahab was greater dan dem fear a Fate. But as ever before, di pagan harpooneers dem did remain almost wholly unimpressed; or if dem did impress, it was only wid a certain magnetism shot inna dem congenial hearts fram inflexible Ahab's.</p>
<p>Fi a space di old man walk di deck inna rolling reveries. But chancing fi slip wid him ivory heel, him si di crushed copper sight-tubes a di quadrant weh him did have di day before dash to di deck.</p>
<p>“Yuh poor, proud heaven-gazer an sun's pilot! yesterday mi wreck yuh, an to-day di compasses woulda fain wreck mi. So, so. But Ahab is lord ova di level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance widout a pole; a top-maul, an di smallest a di sail-maker's Quickles needs!”</p>
<p>Accessory, perhaps, to di impulse dictating di ting him did a go do now, was certain prudential motives, whose object mighta been fi revive di spirits a him crew by a stroke a him subtile skill, inna a matter so wondrous as dat a di inverted compasses. Besides, di ole man well know seh fi steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily practicable, was not a ting fi be pass ova by superstitious sailors, widout some shudderings an evil portents.</p>
<p>“Man,” im se, stedily ton pan di kruu, az di mate gi im di tingz dem we im did a dimaan, “mi man dem, di tonda ton uol Ahab niidl; bot outa dis bit a stiel Ahab kyan mek wan a im uona, we wi shuo az chuu az eni ada wan.”</p>
<p>Abashed glances a servile wonder did exchange by di sailors, as dis was said; an wid fascinated eyes dem did a wait fi whatever magic might follow. But Starbuck look weh.</p>
<p>Wid a blow fram di top-maul Ahab knock off di steel head a di lance, an den handing to di mate di long iron rod weh did lef, bade him hold it upright, widout it touching di deck. Den, wid di maul, afta im repeatedly smiting di upper end a dis iron rod, im put di blunted needle endwise pan di top a it, an less strongly hammer dat, several times, di mate still a hold di rod as before. Den go chuu som likl schrienj muuvment wid it—weda indispensable tu di magnetizing a di stiel, ar jos inten fi augment di awe a di kruu, a unsertain—im kaal fi linen thread; an moving to di binnacle, slip out di two reversed needles deh, an horizontally suspended di sail-needle by it middle, ova one a di compass-cards. At first, di steel did a go round an round, a quiver an a vibrate at either end; but at last it settle to it place, wen Ahab, who did a intently watch fi dis result, step frankly back fram di binnacle, an pointing him stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,—“Look ye, fi unuself, if Ahab not be lord of di level loadstone! Di sun is East, an dat compass it swears!”</p>
<p>Wan afta di ada dem luk iin, kaa notn bot dem uona yai dem kudn persuade soch ignarans laik dem, an wan afta di ada dem slunk we.</p>
<p>Inna him fiery eyes a scorn an triumph, yuh den si Ahab inna all him fatal pride.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00132">CHAPTER 125. Di Log an Line.</h2>
<p>While now di fated Pequod did deh so long afloat dis voyage, di log an line did but very seldom been in use. Bikaaz a wan confident reliance upon ada means fi determine di vessel's place, some merchantmen, an plenty whalemen, especially wen dem a cruising, wholly neglect fi heave di log; though at di same time, an frequently more fi form's sake dan anyting else, regularly putting dung pan di customary slate di course weh di ship did a steer, as well as di presumed average rate a progression every hour. It did deh so wid di Pequod. Di wooden reel an angular log weh did attached did a hang, long untouched, jus unda di railing a di after bulwarks. Rains an spray did damp it; sun an wind did warp it; all di elements dem did combine fi rot a ting weh did a hang so idly. But heedless a all dis, him mood seize Ahab, as him happen fi glance upon di reel, not many hours afta di magnet scene, an him memba how him quadrant neva deh no more, an recall him frantic oath bout di level log an line. Di ship did a sail plungly; astern di billows dem roll inna riots.</p>
<p>“Forward, deh! Heave di log!”</p>
<p>Two seaman come. Di golden-hued Tahitian an di grizzly Manxman. “Tek di reel, one a unu, mi ago heave.”</p>
<p>Dem go towards di extreme stern, pan di ship's lee side, weh di deck, wid di oblique energy a di wind, did now almost dip inna di creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.</p>
<p>Di Manxman tek di reel, an hold it high up, by di projecting handle-ends a di spindle, round weh di spool a line revolve, so stan wid di angular log hanging dung, til Ahab advance to him.</p>
<p>Ahab did a stan up infronta him, an did a lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns fi form a preliminary hand-coil fi toss ovaboard, wen di ole Manxman, weh did a intently eyeing both him an di line, mek bold fi speak.</p>
<p>“Sir, mi mistrust it; dis line look far gone, long heat an wet don spoil it.”</p>
<p>“'Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat an wet, dem spoil yuh? Yuh seem's to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life hold yuh; not thou it.”</p>
<p>“Mi hold di spool, sir. But jus as mi captain seh. Wid dem grey hairs a mi 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially wid a superior, who'll ne'er confess.”</p>
<p>"Weh dat? Deh have a patched professor inna Queen Nature's granite-founded College; but mi tink him too subservient. Weh yuh born?"</p>
<p>“Inna di likkle rocky Isle a Man, sir.”</p>
<p>“Excellent! Yuh hit di worl by dat.”</p>
<p>“Mi no know, sa, but mi born deh.”</p>
<p>“Inna di Isle a Man, hey? Well, di ada way, it good. Yahso a man fram Man; a man weh born inna once independent Man, an now unmanned a Man; weh is suck inna—by weh? Up wid di reel! Di dead, blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last. Up wid it! So.”</p>
<p>Di log did heave. Di loose coils dem rapidly straighten out inna a long dragging line astern, an den, instantly, di reel staat whirl. In turn, jerkingly raised an lowered by di rolling billows, di towing resistance a di log cause di old reelman fi stagger strangely.</p>
<p>“Hold hard!”</p>
<p>Bruk! di overstrained line sagged dung inna one long festoon; di tugging log did gaan.</p>
<p>“Mi crush di quadrant, di thunder turn di needles, an now di mad sea part di log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in yah, Tahitian; reel up, Manxman. An look ye, mek di carpenter mek anodda log, an mend thou di line. See to it.”</p>
<p>“Deh him go now; to him notn neva happen; but to mi, di skewer seems loosening outa di middle a di worl. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian! Dem lines yah run whole, an whirling out: come in broken, an drag slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”</p>
<p>“Pip? Who yuh call Pip? Pip jump fram di whale-boat. Pip miss. Mek wi see now if yuh neva fish him up yah, fisherman. It drag hard; Mi guess him a hold on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; wi haul in no cowards yah. Hom's hatch a hatch! hatchet!</p>
<p>“Peace, yuh crazy loon,” di Manxman baal out, an grab im by di arm. “Away fram di quarter-deck!”</p>
<p>“Di greater idiot eva scold di lesser,” muttered Ahab, advancing. “Hands off fram dat deh holiness! Weh yuh seh Pip did deh, bwoy?</p>
<p>“Astern deh, sa, astern! Lo! lo!”</p>
<p>“An who yuh is, bwoy? Mi no see mi reflection inna di vacant pupils a yuh eyes. Oh God! dat deh man shuda be a ting fi immortal souls fi sieve through! Who yuh is, bwoy?”</p>
<p>“Bell-boy, sir; ship's-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One hundred pounds a clay reward fi Pip; five feet high—look cowardly—quickest known by dat! Ding, dong, ding! Who's seen Pip di coward?”</p>
<p>“No heart can deh above di snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look dung yah. Unu did beget dis luckless child, an have abandoned him, unu creative libertines. Yah, bwoy; Ahab's cabin shall be Pip's home from henceforth, while Ahab lives. Yuh touch mi inmost boy, thou toch mi boy; heart-strings. Come, mek wi dung.”</p>
<p>“Weh dis? yahso a velvet shark-skin,” intently a look pan Ahab han, an a feel it. “Ah, now, did poor Pip but did feel so kind a ting as dis, perhaps him neva did lost! Dis seems to mi, sir, as a man-rope; someting weh weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, mek old Perth now come an rivet dem two han dem tugeda; di black one wid di white, cause mi naa go mek dis go.”</p>
<p>“Oh, bwoy, nor will mi yuh, unless mi shuda thereby drag yuh to worse horrors dan yuh deh yah. Come, den, to mi cabin. Lo! yuh believers inna gods all goodness, an inna man all ill, lo yuh! si di omniscient gods dem oblivious a suffering man; an man, though idiotic, an nuh know weh him do yet, full a di sweet tings an mi come! Come! feel prouder leading yuh by yuh black han, dan though mi grab an Emperor's!”</p>
<p>“Dem go two daft ones now,” di old Manxman muttered. “One daft wid strength, di ada daft wid weakness. But yahso a di end a di rotten line—all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? Mi tink we had best have a new line altogether. Mi ago see Mr. Stubb bout it.”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00133">CHAPTER 126. Di Life-Buoy.</h2>
<p>Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's leveled steel, an har progress solely determined by Ahab's level log an line; di Pequod did a hold pan har path towards di Equator. Mek so long a passage chruu such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, an ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, ova waves monotonously mild; all dem did look like di strange calm tings weh did a prelude some riotous an desperate scene.</p>
<p>At last, wen di ship did a draw near to di outskirts, as it were, a di Equatorial fishing-ground, an inna di deep darkness weh go before di dawn, did a sailing by a cluster a rocky islets; di watch—den headed by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod's murdered Innocents—dat one an all, dem staat fram dem reveries, an fi di space a some moments dem did a stan op, or did a sidong, or did a transfix, all did a listen, like di Roman dem weh did a carve, did a car wild cry remained widin hearing. Di Christian or civilized part a di crew seh a did mermaids, an dem shiem; but di pagan harpooneers dem did stay unappalled. Yet di grey Manxman—di oldest mariner a all—declare seh di wild thrilling sounds dem weh dem did a hear, a did di voices a newly drowned man dem inna di sea.</p>
<p>Below inna him hammock, Ahab neva hear bout dis til gray dawn, wen him come to di deck; it was den recounted to him by Flask, not unacompanied wid hinted dark meanings. Im hollowly laugh, an so explain di wonder.</p>
<p>Dem deh rocky islands deh weh di ship did pass was di resort a great numbers a seals, an some young seals weh did lose dem dams, or some dams weh did lose dem cubs, mus did rise nigh di ship an keep company wid har, crying an sobbing wid dem human sort a wail. But dis only di more affected some a dem, cause most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling bout seals, arising not only fram dem peculiar tones wen dem inna distress, but also fram di human look a dem round heads an semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising fram di water alongside. Inna di sea, unda certain circumstances, seals have more dan once been mistaken fi man.</p>
<p>But di bodings a di crew did destined fi receive a most plausible confirmation inna di fate a one a dem numba dat deh morning. Wen sun-rise dis man goh fram him hammock to him mast-head at di fore; an weda it was dat him neva yet half wake fram him sleep (fi sailors sometimes go aloft inna a transition state), weda it was so wid di man, deh now no telling; but, be dat as it may, him neva deh long a him perch, wen a cry did hear—a cry an a rushing—an looking up, dem si a falling phantom inna di air; an looking dung, a likkle tossed heap a white bubbles inna di blue a di sea.</p>
<p>Di life-buoy—a long slender cask—weh drop fram di stern, weh it always did a hang obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand neva get fi grab it, an di sun did a beat long dis cask it did shrunken, so dat it slowly fill, an dat parched wood did full at it every pore; an di studded iron-bound cask did a fala di sailor to di bottom, as if fi gi him him pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.</p>
<p>An so di fos man a di Pequod weh did mount di mast fi look out fi di White Whale, pan di White Whale's own peculiar ground; dat deh man deh did swallow up inna di deep. But few, perhaps, did tink bout dat at di time. Indeed, in some sort, dem neva did grieve at dis event, at least as a portent; kaa dem neva luk pan it az a foreshadowing a evil inna di future, bot az di fulfillment a wan evil weh dem did presage aredi. Dem declare seh now dem know di reason fi dem wild shrieks dem did hear di night before. But again di ole Manxman seh nay.</p>
<p>Di life-buoy weh did lost did fi get replace; Starbuck did get direct fi see to it; but as no cask a sufficient lightness coulda be found, an as inna di feverish eagerness a weh did look like di approaching crisis a di voyage, all hands did impacient a any toil but weh did directly connected wid its final end, whatever dat might prove to be; so, dem did a go lef di ship stern unprovided wid a buoy, wen by certain strange signs an inuendoes Queequeg hint a hint concerning him coffin.</p>
<p>“A life-buoy a one coffin!” Starbuck baal out, an staat.</p>
<p>“Rather queer, dat, mi shuda seh,” Stubb seh.</p>
<p>“It ago mek a good enough one,” seh Flask, “di carpenter yah can arrange it easily.”</p>
<p>“Bring it up; notn else nuh deh fi it,” Starbuck seh, afta a melancholy pause. “Rig it, carpenter; no look pon mi so—di coffin, mi mean. Yuh hear mi? Rig it.”</p>
<p>“An mi fi nail dong di lid, sa?” a move him han as wid a hammer.</p>
<p>“Aye.”</p>
<p>“An mi fi caulk di seams, sa?” a move him han as wid a caulking-iron.</p>
<p>“Aye.”</p>
<p>“An mi fi pay ova di same wid pitch, sa?” a move him han as wid a pitch-pot.</p>
<p>“Away! weh possess yuh to dis? Mek a life-buoy a di coffin, an no more.—Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward wid mi.”</p>
<p>“Im go aaf ina wahn huff. Di uol im kyahn dwiit; a di paat dem im baul. Nou mi no laik dis. Mi mek a leg fi Kaptan Ahab, an im wier it laik wahn jentlman; bot mi mek wahn bandbaks fi Kwiinz, an im naa go put im ed ina it.

<h2 id="pgepubid00135">CHAPTER 128. Di Pequod Meets Di Rachel.</h2>
<p>Next day, a big ship, di Rachel, did describe, bearing directly dung pan di Pequod, all har spars thickly clustering wid man. At di time di Pequod did a mek good speed chruu di wata; but as di broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to har, di boastful sails dem all fall tugeda as blank bladders weh burst, an all life run weh fram di smitten hull.</p>
<p>“Bad nyuuz; shi bring bad nyuuz,” di uol Manxman mutter. But before har commander, who, wid trumpet to mout, did a stan op inna him boat; ere him coulda hopefully hail, Ahab's voice did hear.</p>
<p>“Yuh si di White Whale?”</p>
<p>“Aye, yesterday. Yuh si a whale-boat adrift?”</p>
<p>Throttling him joy, Ahab negatively ansa dis unexpected question; an woulda den fain boarded di stranger, wen di stranger captain himself, having stop him vessel's way, did see descending har side. A few keen pulls, an him boat-hook soon clinch di Pequod's main-chains, an him sprang to di deck. Immediately him get recognize by Ahab fi a Nantucketer weh him did know. But no formal salutation neva exchange.</p>
<p>“Weh him did deh?—not kill!—not kill!” Ahab baal out, a kom nier. “How it was?”</p>
<p>It did look like somewhat late pan di aftanuun a di day before, while three a di stranger's boats dem did a engage wid a shoal a whales, weh did a lead dem some four or five miles fram di ship; an while dem did still inna swift chase to windward, di white hump an head a Moby Dick did suddenly loom up outa di wata, not very far to leeward; whereupon, di fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had get instantly lowered inna chase. Afta a keen sail before di wind, dis fourth boat—di swiftest keeled a all—seemed it did succeed in fastenning—at least, as well as di man at di mast-head coulda tell anyting bout it. Inna di distance him si di diminished dotted boat; an den a swift gleam a bubbling white water; an afta dat notn muor; weh it did conclude seh di stricken whale mus did run weh wid him pursuers indefinitely, as often happen. Dem did have some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. Di recall signals dem did put inna di rigging; darkness come on; an forced fi pick up har three far to windward boats—ere going in quest a di fourth one inna di precisely opposite direction—di ship neva only been necessitate fi lef dat deh boat to its fate til near midnight, but, fi di time, fi increase har distance fram it. But di rest a har crew being at last safe abord, she crowd all sail—stunsail on stunsail—afta di missing boat; kitling a fire inna har try-pots fi a beacon; an every ada man aloft pan di look-out. But though wen she did so sail a sufficient distance fi gain di presumed place a di absent ones wen she last seen; though she den pause fi lower har spare boats fi pull all roun har; an wen dem neva find nutten, dem did dash on again; again pause, an lower har boats; an though she did a gwaan do so til daylight; yet not di least glimpse a di missing keel did deh.</p>
<p>Di story tell, di stranger Captain immediately go on fi reveal him object inna boarding di Pequod. Him did waan dat deh ship fi unit wid him own inna di search; by sailing ova di sea some four or five miles apart, pan parallel lines, an so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.</p>
<p>“Mi ago wager someting now,” Stubb whispered to Flask, “dat some one inna dat deh missing boat did wear off dat deh Captain's bes coat; mayhap, him watch—im so cursed anxious fi get it back. Who eva hear bout two pious whale-ships cruising afta one missing whale-boat inna di height a di whaling season, Flask, how him see? looks—pale inna di very buttons a him eyes—look—it neva di coat—it mosi did di—”</p>
<p>“Mi bwoy, mi own bwoy deh mongst dem. Fi God's sake—mi beg, mi conjure”—here exclaimed di stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had but icily received him petition. “Fi eight-an-forty hours mek mi charter yuh ship—mi wi gladly pay fi it, an roundly pay fi it—if no ada way no deh—fi eight-an-forty hours only—only dat—yuh haffi, oh, yuh haffi, an yuh <i>shall</i> do dis ting.”</p>
<p>“Im son!” Stubb baal out, “oh, a im son im laas! Mi tek bak di kuot an wach—we Ahab se? Wi afi siev da bwai de.”</p>
<p>“Im drown wid di res pan dem, laas nait,” se di uol Manx sailor weh did a stan op bihain dem; “Mi ier, aal a unu ier dem spirit.”</p>
<p>Now, as it shortly turn out, weh mek dis incident a di Rachel's di more melancholy, was di circumstance, dat not only was one a di Captain's sons mongst di numba a di missing boat's crew; but among di numba a di ada boat's crews, at di same time, but pan di ada han, separate fram di ship during di dark vicissitudes a di chase, deh did have still anodda son; as dat fi a time, di wretched fadda did plunge to di bottom a di cruelest perplexity; weh did only solved fi him by him chief mate's instinctively adopting di ordinary procedure a one whale-ship inna such emergencies, dat is, wen dem put it between jeoparized but divided boats, always fi pick up di majority first. But di captain, fi some unknown constitutional reason, did refrain fram mention all dis, an not til forced to it by Ahab's iciness did him allude to him one yet missing bwoy; a likkle lad, but twelve years old, whose fadda wid di earnest but unmisgiving hardihood a one Nantucketer's paternal love, did thus early search fi initiate him inna di perils an wonders a one vocation almost immemorially di destiny a all him race. Nor it nuh unfrequently occur, dat Nantucket captains will send a son a such tender age weh fram dem, fi a protracted three or four years' voyage inna some other ship dan dem own; so dat dem first knowledge a a whaleman's career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a fadda's natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.</p>
<p>Meantime, now di stranger did still a beg him poor boon a Ahab; an Ahab still did a stan up like an anvil, a get every shock, but widout di least quivering a him own.</p>
<p>“Mi naa go,” di stranger seh, “til yuh seh <i>yee</i> tu mi. Du tu mi laik ou yuh waahn mi fi du tu yuh inna di siem kies. Kaaz <i>yuh</i> tu av wan bwai, Captain Ahab—alduo a wan pikni, an a nestling sief a yaad nou—a pikni a yu uol iej tu—Yes, yes, yu rilent; mi si it—ron, ron, man, an tan op bai di yaad nou.”</p>
<p>“Avast,” Ahab baal out—“no touch a rope-yarn”; den inna a voice weh prolongingly mould every word—“Captain Gardiner, mi naa go do it. Even now mi lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless yuh, man, an mek mi forgive miself, but mi haffi go. Mr. Starbuck, look pon di binnacle watch, an inna three minutes fram dis present instant warn off all strangers again: den brace forward, as di sailship, as di sail forward bifor."</p>
<p>Hurriedly turning, wid averted face, descended inna him cabin, leaving di strange captain transfixed at dis unconditional an utter rejection a him so earnest suit. But staatin fram him enchantment, Gardiner silently hurried to di side; more fall dan step inna him boat, an go back to him ship.</p>
<p>Likl afta dat di two ship dem diverge dem wake; an lang as di strange vessel did deh inna view, she did a yaw hither an thither at every dark spot, however small, pan di sea. Dis way an dat har yards dem did swing round; starboard an larboard, she continue fi tack; now she beat against a head sea; an again it push har before it; while all di while, har masts an yards dem did thickly cluster wid man, as three tall cherry trees, wen di bwoy dem a cherry mongst di boughs.</p>
<p>But by har still halting course an winding, woeful way, yuh plainly si seh dis ship weh so wept wid spray, still stay widout comfort. Shi was Rachel, weh did a cry fi har pickney dem, cause dem neva deh deh.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00137">CHAPTER 130. Di Hat.</h2>
<p>An now dat at di proper time an place, afta so long an wide a preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed him did a chase him foe inna one ocean-fold, fi slay him di more securely deh; now, dat him did find himself hard by di very latitude an longitude weh him tormenting wound did get inflict; now dat a vessel did a taak weh pan di very day preceding did actually encounter Moby Dick;—an now dat all him successive meetings wid various ships contrastingly concurred fi show di demoniac indifference wid which di white whale did a tire him hunters, weda sinning or sinning against; now it was dat deh did lurk a someting inna di old man's eyes, weh it was hardly sufferable fi feeble souls fi see. As di unsetting polar star, weh chruu di livelong, arctic, six months' night sustain it piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed dung pan di constant midnight a di gloomy crew. It domineer above dem so, dat all dem bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, did fain fi hide unda dem souls, an neva sprout out a single spear or leaf.</p>
<p>Inna dis foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural, vanish. Stubb no more strove fi raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove fi check one. Alike, joy an sorrow, hope an fear, did look ground to finest dust, an powdered, fi di time, inna di clamped mortar a Ahab's iron soul. Like machines, dem dumbly move bout di deck, ever conscious seh di old man's despot eye did deh pan dem.</p>
<p>But yuh did deeply scan him inna him more secret confidential hours; wen him did tink no glance but one did deh pan him; den yuh woulda see seh even as Ahab's eyes so awed di crew's, di inscrutable Parsee's glance awed him; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affect it. Such an added, gliding strangeness staat invest di thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shake him; dat di man dem did a look dubious pan him; half uncertain, as it did look, weda indeed him was a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast pan di deck by some unseen being's body. An dat deh shadow deh did always a hover deh. For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go below. Im woulda stan op still fi hours: but neva sidong or lean; him wan but wondrous eyes did plainly seh—We two watchmen neva rest.</p>
<p>Nor, at any time, by night or day di mariners couldn't step pan di deck, unless Ahab did deh before dem; either standing inna him pivot-hole, or exactly pacing di planks between two undeviating limits,—di main-mast an di mizen; or else dem si him a stan op inna di cabin-scuttle,—im living foot did a go pan di deck, as if fi step; him hat slouch heavily ova him eyes; so dat how motionless him did a stan op, how di days an nights dem did add on, dat him neva swing inna him hammock; yet hidden unda dat deh slouching hat, dem coulda neva tell unerringly weda, fi all dis, him eyes dem did really close at times; or if him did still a scan dem intently; no matter, though him did a stan op so inna di scuttle fi a whole hour pan di stretch, an di unheeded night-damp did a gather inna beads a dew pan dat deh stone-carved coat an hat. Di clothes dem weh di night did wet, di next day's sunshine dry pan him; an so, die afta die, an nait afta nait; him neva go unda di planks no more; whatever him did waan fram di cabin dat deh ting him sen fi.</p>
<p>Him did nyam inna di same open air; dat mean, him two only meals,—breakfast an dinner: supper him neva touch; nor reap him beard; weh darkly grow all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown ova, weh still grow idly pan at naked base, though perished inna di upper verdure. But though him whole life did now become one watch pan deck; an though di Parsee's mystic watch was widout intermission as him own; yet dem two yah neva did a taak—one man to di ada—unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter mek it necessary. Though such a potent spell did look like it did a join di twoin; openly, an to di awe-struck crew, dem did look like pole-like asunder. If by day dem did chance fi speak one word; by night, dumb man dem did deh both, so far as concerned di slightest verbal interchange. Somtaim, fi longest hours, widout a single hail, dem did a stan up far apart inna di starlight; Ahab inna him scuttle, di Parsee by di mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if inna di Parsee Ahab did si him forethrown shadow, inna Ahab di Parsee him abandoned substance.</p>
<p>An yet, somehow, did Ahab—in him own proper self, as daily, hourly, an every instant, commandingly revealed to him subordinates,—Ahab did look like an independent lord; di Parsee but him slave. Stil again both did a look like dem did a joke tugeda, an a unseen tyrant did a drive dem; di lean shade siding di solid rib. For be dis Parsee what him may, all rib an keel was solid Ahab.</p>
<p>At di fos faintest glimmering a di dawn, him iron voice did hear fram aft,—“Man di mast-heads!”—an all chruu di day, til afta sunset an afta twilight, di same voice every hour, at di striking a di helmsman's bell, did hear—“Weh d'ye see?—sharp!!”</p>
<p>But wen three or four days pass, afta dem meet di children-seeking Rachel; an no spout neva get si yet; di monomaniac old man did look like him did a trust him crew's fidelity; at least, a nearly all except di Pagan harpooneers; him did a doubt, even, weda Stubb an Flask might not willingly overlook di sight weh him did a look fah. But if dem suspicion deh did really fi him, him sagaciously refrain fram verbally express dem, however him actions might seem to hint dem.</p>
<p>“Mi ago have di first sight a di whale miself,”—im seh. “Aye! Ahab haffi have di doubloon!” an wid him own han dem him rig a nest a basketed bowlines; an sending a han aloft, wid a single sheaved block, fi secure to di main-mast head, him get di two ends a di downward-reeved rope; an attaching one to him basket prepared a pin fi di other end, in order fi fasten it at di rail. Dis don, wid dat deh end yet inna him han an stan op saida di pin, him look roun pan him crew, a swiip fram wan tu di ada; pausing him glance long pan Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; an den settle him firm relying eye pan di chief mate, seh,—“Tek di rope, sir—mi gi it inna yuh han dem, Starbuck.” Den im arrange im person inna di basket, im gi di wod fi dem hoist im to im perch, Starbuck a di one weh secure di rope at last; an aftawod stan op nier it. An so, wid one han a cling roun di royal mast, Ahab did a look pan di sea fi miles an miles,—ahead, astern, dis side, an dat,—widin di wide expanded circle weh did a command at so great a height.</p>
<p>Wen im did a work wid im han dem at some lofty almost isolated place inna di rigging, weh chances fi afford no foothold, di sailor at sea get hoist op to dat deh spot, an sustain deh by di rope; anda dem circumstances yah, it fastened end pan deck is always given in strict charge to some one man weh have di special watch a it. Bikaaz inna such a wilderness a running rigging, whose various different relations aloft cyaan always be infallibly discern by weh yuh see a dem at di deck; an wen di deck-ends a dem rope yah a get cast dung evri few minutes fram di fastenings, it woulda be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided wid a constant watchman, di hoisted sailor shuda by some carelessness a di crew be cast adrift an fall all swooping to di sea. So Ahab's proceedings inna dis matter neva unusual; di ongl strange ting bout dem did look like, dat Starbuck, almost di one only man weh did eva venture fi oppose him wid anyting inna di slightest degree approaching to decision—one a dem too, whose faithfulness pan di look-out him did look like him did a doubt likkle;—it was strange, dat dis was di very man him shuda select fi him watchman; freely giving him whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands.</p>
<p>Now, di first time Ahab did a perched aloft; ere him did deh deh ten minutes; one a dem red-billed savage sea-hawks weh so often fly incommodiously close round di manned mast-heads a whalemen inna dem latitudes; one a dem birds deh come a wheel an a scream roun him head inna a maze a untrackably swift circlings. Den it dart a thousand feet straight up inna di air; den spiralize downwards, an go eddying again roun him head.</p>
<p>But wid him gaze fixed pan di dim an distant horizon, Ahab did look like him neva did a mark dis wild bird; nor, indeed, woulda any else have mark it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost di least heedful eye did a see some sort a cunning meaning inna almost every sight.</p>
<p>“Yuh hat, yuh hat, sa!” suddenly cried di Sicilian seaman, who being posted at di mizen-mast-head, did a stan up directly behind Ahab, though somewhat lower dan him level, an wid a deep gulf a air dividing dem.</p>
<p>But already di sable wing did deh before di ole man eyes; di long hooked bill at him head: wid a scream, di black hawk dart weh wid him prize.</p>
<p>Wan eagle fly thrice roun Tarquin head, tek weh him cap fi replace it, an den Tanaquil, him wife, declare seh Tarquin woulda be king a Rome. But only by di replacing a di cap was dat omen accounted good. Ahab's hat neva get restore; di wild hawk fly on an on wid it; far in advance a di prow: an at last disappear; while fram di point a dat deh disappearance, a minute black spot did dimly discern, a fall fram dat deh vast height inna di sea.</p>
