<p>“HIST! Yuh hear dat deh noise, Cabaco?”</p>
<p>A did di middle-watch: a fair moonlight; di seamen dem did a stan op inna a cordon, extending fram one a di fresh-water butts inna di waist, to di scuttle-butt near di taffrail. Inna dis manner, dem pass di buckets fi fill di scuttle-butt. Stan op, fi di muos paat, pan di hallowed precincts a di quarter-deck, dem did kierful fi no taak ar rustle dem fut. Fram han tu han, di bucket dem go inna di deepest silence, ongl brok bai di occasional flap a wan sail, an di steady hum a di unceasingly advancing keel.</p>
<p>A did inna di midst a dis repose, dat Archy, one a di cordon, whose post did deh near di after-hatches, whisper to him neighbor, a Cholo, di words above.</p>
<p>“Hist! yuh hear dat deh noise, Cabaco?”</p>
<p>“Tek di bucket, yuh waan, Archy? weh noise d'ye mean?”</p>
<p>“Dem deh deh again—anda di hatches—yuh nuh hear it—a cough—it sound like a cough.”</p>
<p>“Cough be damned! Pass along dat deh return bucket.”</p>
<p>“Deh again—deh it deh!—it soun laik two or three sleepers a turn ova, now!”</p>
<p>“Caramba! yuh don, shipmate, yuh will? A di three soaked biscuits yuh eat fi supper turn ova inside a yuh—notn else. Look to di bucket!”</p>
<p>“Se weh yuh waan, shipmate, mi have shaap ears.”</p>
<p>“Aye, yuh a di chap, ain't yuh, weh hear di hum a di old Quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea fram Nantucket; yuh a di chap.”</p>
<p>“Grin away; wi ago si weh turn up. Hark ye, Cabaco, deh deh somebody dung inna di after-hold weh dem neva si yet pan deck; an mi suspect wi ole Mogul know someting a it too. Mi hear Stubb tell Flask, one morning watch, seh deh did have someting a dat sort inna di wind.”</p>
<p>“Tish! di bucket!”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00049">CHAPTER 44. Di Chart.</h2>
<p>If yuh did follow Captain Ahab dung inna him cabin afta di squall weh tek place pan di night weh did succeeding dat wild ratification a him purpose wid him crew, yuh woulda see him go to a locker inna di transom, an bring out a large wrinkled roll a yellowish sea charts, spread dem before him pan him screwed-down table. Den seating himself before it, yuh woulda see him intently study di various lines an shadings weh deh did meet him eye; an wid slow but steady pencil trace additional courses ova spaces weh before did blank. At intervals, him woulda refer to piles a old log-books beside him, weh dem did set dung di seasons an places in which, pan various former voyages a various ships, sperm whales did get capture or seen.</p>
<p>While so employed, di heavy pewter lamp suspended inna chains ova him head, continually rock wid di motion a di ship, an fi ever throw shifting gleams an shadows a lines upon him wrinkled brow, til it almost seemed dat while him himself did a mark out lines an courses pan di wrinkled charts, some pencils did a trace out some pencils an courses lines pan di deeply marked chart a him forehead.</p>
<p>But it was not dis night in particular dat, inna di solitude a him cabin, Ahab thus pondered ova him charts. Almost every night dem did a bring dem out; almost every night some pencil marks did a efface, an others did a substitute. For wid di charts a all four oceans before him, Ahab did a thread a maze a currents an eddies, wid a view to di more certain accomplishment a dat deh monomaniac thought a him soul.</p>
<p>Now, to any one weh nuh fully acquainted wid di ways a di leviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus fi seek out one solitary creature inna di unhooped oceans a dis planet. But not so it did look to Ahab, who did know di sets a all tides an currents; an thereby calculating di driftings a di sperm whale's food; an, also, calling to mind di regular, ascertained seasons fi hunting him inna particular latitudes; coulda arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties, concerning di timeliest day fi be upon dis or dat ground in search a him prey.</p>
<p>So assured, indeed, is di fact concerning di periodicalness a di sperm whale's resorting to given waters, dat plenty hunters believe seh, coulda him be closely observed an studied throughout di world; if di logs fi one voyage a di entire whale fleet did carefully collated, den di migrations a di sperm whale woulda be found fi correspond in invariability to dem a di herring-shoals or di flights a swallows. Pan dis hint, attempts dem mek fi construct elaborate migratory charts a di sperm whale.*</p>
<div class="pgmonospaced">*Since di above did write, di statement is happily borne<br/> out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of<br/> di National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By<br/> dat deh circular, it appear seh precisely such a chart deh inna<br/> course a completion; an portions a it deh inna<br/> di circular. “Dis chart divide di ocean inna districts<br/> a five degrees a latitude by five degrees a longitude;<br/> perpendicularly through each a which districts are twelve<br/> columns fi di twelve months; an horizontally chruu each<br/> a which districts dem have three lines; wan fi shuo di nomba<br/> a days weh dem spen inna each month inna every<br/> district, an di two ada wan dem fi shuo di nomba a die dem inna<br/> weh whales, sperm or right, dem did si.”<br/></div>
<p>Besides, wen dem a mek a passage fram one feeding-ground to anodda, di sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret intelligence fram di Deity—mostly swim inna <i>veins</i> , as dem call dem; continuing dem way along a given ocean-line wid such undeviating exactitude, dat no ship ever sail har course, by any chart, wid one tithe a such marvelous precision. Though, inna dem cases yah, di direction weh any one whale tek be straight as a surveyor's parallel, an though di line a advance be strictly confined to it own unavoidable, straight wake, yet di arbitrary <i>vein</i> in which at dem times deh seh him a swim, generally embrace some few miles in width (more or less vein is presumed or expand); but neva exceed di visual sweep fram di whale-ship's mast-heads, wen circumspectly gliding along dis magic zone. Di sum is, dat at particular seasons widin dat breadth an along dat path, migrating whales may wid great confidence be looked fi.</p>
<p>An hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate feeding-grounds, coulda Ahab hope fi encounter him prey; but inna crossing di widest expanses a water between dem grounds deh him coulda, by him art, so place an time himself pan him way, as even den not fi be wholly widout prospect a meeting.</p>
<p>Deh did have a circumstance weh at first sight did look like it did a entangle him delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so inna di reality, perhaps. Though di gregarious sperm whales dem have dem regular seasons fi particular grounds, yet in general yuh cyaan conclude seh di herds dem weh haunted such an such a latitude or longitude dis year, say, ago turn out fi be identically di same wid dem weh dem did find deh di preceding season; though deh deh peculiar an unquestionable instances weh di contrary a dis don prove true. In general, di same remark, only widin a less wide limit, apply to di solitaries an hermits mongst di matured, aged sperm whales. So dat though Moby Dick did inna a former year been seen, fi example, pan weh dem call di Seychelle ground inna di Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay pan di Japanese Coast; yet it neva follow, dat if di Pequod did a visit either a dem spots deh at any subsequent corresponding season, she woulda infallibly encounter him deh. So, too, wid some ada feeding grounds, weh him did at times reveal himself. But all dem did look like him casual stop-places an ocean-inns, so fi seh, not him places a prolonged abode. An weh Ahab's chances fi accomplish him object have hitherto been taak bout, allusion has only been mek to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects was him, ere a particular set time or place were attained, wen all possibilities woulda become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly tink, every possibility the next ting to a certainty. Dat deh particular set time an place did conjoin inna di one technical phrase—di Season-on-the-Line. Fi deh an den, fi several consecutive years, Moby Dick did a been periodically described, lingering inna dem deh waters fi awhile, as di sun, inna it annual round, loiters fi a predicted interval in any one sign a di Zodiac. Deh deh, too, weh most a di deadly encounters wid di white whale did tek place; deh di waves dem did a stored wid him deeds; deh did have dat deh tragic spot weh di monomaniac old man did find di awful motive fi him vengeance. But inna di cautious comprehensiveness an unloitering vigilance wid which Ahab throw him brooding soul inna dis unfaltering hunt, him wouldn't permit himself fi rest all him hopes upon di one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to dem hopes; nor inna di sleeplessness a him vow him coulda so tranquillize him unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.</p>
<p>Now, di Pequod did sail fram Nantucket at di very beginning a di Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor den coulda enable har commander fi mek di great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, an den running dung sixty degrees a latitude arrive inna di equatorial Pacific in time fi cruise deh. So, him haffi wait fi di next season. Yet di premature hour a di Pequod's sailing did, perhaps, been correctly select by Ahab, wid a view to dis very complexion a tings. Bikaaz, wan interval a three hundred an sixty-five days an nights did deh before him; an interval weh, instead a impatiently enduring ashore, him woulda spen inna a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance di White Whale, spen him vacation inna seas far remote fram him periodical feeding-grounds, shuda turn up him wrinkled brow off di Persian Gulf, or inna di Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or inna any ada waters haunted by him race. So dat Monsoons, Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but di Levanter an Simoon, might blow Moby Dick inna di devious zig-zag world-circle a di Pequod's circumnavigating wake.</p>
<p>But granting all dis; yet, regarded discreetly an coolly, seems it not but a mad idea, dis; dat inna di broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if dem encounter, shuda be thought capable a individual recognition fram him hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti inna di thronged thoroughfares a Constantinople? Yea. Fi di peculiar snow-white brow a Moby Dick, an him snow-white hump, couldn't but be unmistakable. An mi neva tallied di whale, Ahab woulda mutter to himself, as afta him poring ova him charts til lang afta midnight him woulda throw himself back inna reveries—tallied him, an shall him escape? Him broad fins dem bored, an scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear! An yahso, him mad mind woulda run on inna a breathless race; til a weariness an faintness a pondering come ova him; an inna di open air a di deck him woulda seek fi recover him strength. Ah, God! weh transes a torments dat deh man endure weh is consumed wid one unachieved revengeful desire. Him sleep wid him han dem clenched; an wake wid him own bloody nails inna him palms.</p>
<p>Often, wen him force fram him hammock by exhausting an intolerably vivid dreams of di night, weh, resuming him own intense thoughts through di day, carry dem on amid a clashing of phrensies, an whirl dem round an round an round inna him blazing brain, til di very throbbing a him life-spot became insufferable anguffer; an wen, as was sometimes di case, dem spiritual throes inna him heave him being up fram it base, an a chasm seemed opening inna him, fram which forked flames an lightnings shot up, an accursed fiends beckon him fi leap dung mongst dem; wen dis hell inna himself did a yawn unda him, a wild cry woulda be heard through di ship; an wid glaring eyes Ahab woulda burst outa him state room, as if him did a get weh fram a bed weh did a bon. Yet dem, perhaps, instead a being di unsuppressable symptoms a some latent weakness, or fright at him own resolve, was but di plainest tokens a it intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, di scheming, unapeasedly steadfast hunter a di white whale; dis Ahab weh did goh to him hammock, neva di agent weh so cause him fi burst fram it inna horror again. Di latta was di eternal, living principle or soul inna him; an inna sleep, being fi di time dissociated fram di characterizing mind, weh at other times employ it fi it outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously did a try escape fram di scorching contiguity a di frantic ting, weh, fi di time, it neva did a integral no more. But as di mind nuh exist unless leagued wid di soul, therefore it mus been dat, inna Ahab's case, yielding up all him thoughts an fancies to him one supreme purpose; dat deh purpose, by it own sheer inveteracy a will, force itself against gods an devils into a kind a self-assumed, independent being a it own. Nay, coulda grimly live an burn, while di common vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from di unbidden an unfathered birth. So, di tormented spirit weh did a glare outa bodily eyes, wen weh did look like Ahab did a rush fram him room, was fi di time but a vacated ting, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray a living light, fi be sure, but widout an object fi colour, an therefore a blankness inna itself. God help yuh, ole man, yuh thoughts dem mek a creature inna yuh; an him whose intense tinkin mek him a Prometheus; a vulture feed pan dat deh heart fi eva; dat vulture di very creature weh him mek.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00050">CHAPTER 45. Di Affidavit.</h2>
<p>So far as weh yuh have a narrative inna dis book; an, indeed, as indirectly touching one or two very interesting an curious particulars inna di habits a sperm whales, di foregoing chapter, inna it earlier part, is as important a one as wi ago find inna dis volume; but di leading matter a it require fi be still further an more familiarly enlarged upon, in order fi be adequately understood, an moreover fi tek weh any incredulity weh a profound ignorance a di entire subject may induce inna some minds, as to di natural verity a di main points a dis affair.</p>
<p>Mi care not fi perform dis part a mi task methodically; but shall be content fi produce di desired impression by separate citations a items, practically or reliably known to mi as a whaleman; an fram dem citations yah, mi tek it—di conclusion weh aim at will naturally follow of itself.</p>
<p>Fos: Mi have personally know three instances weh a whale, afta him get a harpoon, have effect a complete escape; an, afta wan interval (in one instance a three years), dem get hit again by di same han, an slain; wen di two irons, both marked by di same private cypher, did tek weh fram di body. Inna di instance weh three years intervene between di flinging a di two harpoons; an mi tink it maita did been someting more dan dat; di man weh did a dart dem happening, inna di interval, fi go inna a trading ship pan a voyage to Africa, go shore deh, jain a discovery party, an penetrate far inna di interior, weh him travel fi a period a nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmasons, wid all di ada incidents inna di heart a wandering unknown regions. Meanwhile, di whale weh him did hit mus did deh pan it travels tu; no doubt it did thrice circumnavigate di globe, brushing wid it flanks all di coasts a Africa; but fi nuh purpose. Dis man an dis whale come tugeda agen, an di one win di ada one. Mi seh mi, miself, have known three instances similar to dis; dat is inna two a dem mi si di whales dem get hit; an, pan di secan attack, si di two irons wid di respective marks cut inna dem, aftawards tek fram di dead fish. Inna di three-year instance, it so fall out dat mi did deh inna di boat both times, first an last, an di last time distinctly recognize a peculiar sort a huge mole unda di whale's eye, weh mi did observe deh three years before. Mi seh three years, but mi pretty sure it was more dan dat. Yahso a three instances, den, weh mi personally know di truth a; but mi hear bout plenty ada instances fram people whose veracity inna di matter nuh have no good ground fi impeach.</p>
<p>Secondly: It well known inna di Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant di world ashore may be of it, dat deh have several memorable historical instances weh a particular whale inna di ocean did deh at distant times an places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale did get so marked was not altogether an originally owing to him bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; fi how peculiar inna dat deh respect any chance whale may be, dem soon put an end to him peculiarities by killing him, an boil him dung inna a peculiarly valuable oil. No: di reason was dis: dat fram di fatal experiences a di fishery deh did a hang a terrible prestige a perilousness bout such a whale as deh did bout Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch dat most fishermen did content fi recognize him by merely touching dem tarpaulins wen him woulda be discover lounging by dem pan di sea, widout seking to cultivate more intimateance. Like some poor devils asshore weh happen fi know an irascible great man, dem mek distant unobtrusive salutations to him inna di street, lest if dem pursue di acquaintance further, dem might receive a summary thump fi dem presumption.</p>
<p>But not only did each a dem famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity—Nay, yuh may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only him did famous inna life an now is immortal inna forecastle stories afta death, but him did admit inna all di rights, privileges, an distinctions a one name; did have as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it neva so, O Timor Tom! yuh famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long did'st lurk inna di Oriental straits a dat deh name, whose spout was oft seen fram di palmy beach a Ombay? A neva so, O New Zealand Jack! yuh terror a all cruisers weh cross dem wake inna di vicinity a di Tattoo Land? A neva so, O Morquan! King a Japan, whose lofty jet dem seh at times assumed di semblance a one snow-white cross against di sky? A neva so, O Don Miguel! yuh Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise wid mystic hieroglyphics pan di back! Inna plain prose, yahso a four whales as well known to di students a Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to di classic scholar.</p>
<p>But dis a nuh all. New Zealand Tom an Don Miguel, afta at various times dem did a create great havoc mongst di boats dem a different vessels, dem did finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased an kill by valiant whaling captains, who heave up dem anchors wid dat deh express object as much in view, as in setting out through di Narragan Woods Captain Butler did have inna him old set mind fi capture dat deh notorious murderous savage Annawon, di headmost warrior a di Indian King Philip.</p>
<p>Mi no know weh mi can find a betta place dan jus yah, fi mek mention a one or two ada tings, weh to mi seem important, as in printed form establishing in all respects di reasonableness a di whole story a di White Whale, more especially di catastrophe. For dis a one a dem disheartening instances weh truth require full as much bolstering as error. So ignorant a most landsmen a some a di plainest an most palpable wonders a di worl, dat widout some hints touching di plain facts, historical an otherwise, a di fishery, dem might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse an more detestable, a hideous an intolerable allegory.</p>
<p>Fos: Though most man have some vague flitting ideas a di general perils a di grand fishery, yet dem have nutten like a fixed, vivid conception a dem perils deh, an di frequency wid which dem recur. One reason perhaps is, dat not one inna fifty a di actual disasters an deaths by casualties inna di fishery, eva find a public record at home, however transient an immediately forgotten dat record. Yuh tink dat deh poor fellow deh, weh dis moment perhaps get ketch by di whale-line off di coast a New Guinea, a get carry dung to di bottom a di sea by di sounding leviathan—yuh tink seh dat deh poor fellow name ago appear inna di newspaper obituary yuh ago read to-morrow at yuh breakfast? No: cause di mails dem very irregular between yah an New Guinea. Mata a fak, yu eva ier we maita kaal regyula nyuuz dairek ar indirek fram Nyuu Gini? Yet mi tell yuh seh pan one particular voyage weh mi mek to di Pacific, mongst plenty ada ships wi did a taak bout thirty different ships, every one a dem did have a death by a whale, some a dem more dan one, an three weh did each lost a boat's crew. Fi God's sake, be economical wid yuh lamps an candles! not a gallon yuh burn, but at least one drop a man blood did spill fi it.</p>
<p>Secondly: People shore have indeed some indefinite idea dat a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power; but mi eva find out seh wen mi a narrate to dem some specific example a dis two-fold enormousness, dem significantly compliment mi upon mi facetiousness; wen, mi declare pan mi soul, mi neva have no more idea a being facetious dan Moses, wen him did write di history a di plagues a Egypt.</p>
<p>But fortunately di special point mi yah seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of mi own. Dat point is dis: Di Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, an judiciously malicious, as wid direct aforethought fi stave in, utterly destroy, an sink a large ship; an weh more, di Sperm Whale <i>don</i> do it.</p>
<p>Fos: Inna di year 1820 di ship Essex, Captain Pollard, a Nantucket, did a cruise inna di Pacific Ocean. One day she si spouts, lower har boats, an gi chase to a shoal a sperm whales. Ere long, several a di whales dem did get wound; wen, suddenly, a very big whale weh did a get weh fram di boat dem, did a come outa di shoal, an did a bore directly dung pan di ship. Dashing him forehead against har hull, him so stove har in, dat inna less dan “ten minutes” she settle dung an fall ova. Not a surviving plank a har neva see since den. Afta di severest exposure, part a di crew reach di lan inna dem boats. Wen dem did a goh back home at last, Captain Pollard did a sail fi di Pacific inna command a anodda ship, but di gods dem shipwreck him again pan unknown rocks an breakers; fi di secan time him ship did utterly lost, an forthwith forswearing di sea, him neva temp it since. At dis day Captain Pollard a one resident a Nantucket. Mi si Owen Chace, weh was chief mate a di Essex at di time a di tragedy; Mi don read him plain an faithful narrative; Mi don taak wid him son; an all dis widin a few miles a di scene a di catastrophe.*</p>
<p>*Di following a extracts fram Chace's narrative: “Every fact did look like it did warrant mi fi conclude seh a did anyting but chance weh did a direct him operations; him did mek two several attacks pan di ship, at a short interval between dem, both a dem, according to dem direction, did calculate fi do wi di most injury, by being mek ahead, an deh by combining di two object fi shock di two; effect which, di exact manœuvres weh him mek did necessary. Him aspect was most horrible, an such as indicated resentment an fury Him did come directly fram di shoal weh we did jus before enter, an in which we did strike three a him companions, as if fired wid revenge fi dem sufferings.” Again: “At all events, di whole circumstances tek tugeda, all a gwaan before mi own eyes, an a produce, at di time, impressions inna mi mind a decided, calculating mischief, pan di part a di whale (many a dem impressions mi cyan now recall), induce mi fi be satisfied seh mi correct inna mi opinion.”</p>
<p>Yahso a him reflections some time afta him lef di ship, during a black night inna an open boat, wen almost despairing fi reach any hospitable shore. “Di dark ocean an di swelling waters dem neva nutten; di fears dem fi get swallow up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed pan hidden rocks, wid all di ada ordinary subjects a fearful contemplation, did look scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; di dismal looking wreck, an <i>di horrid aspect an revenge a di revenge</i> , wholly mi did tink day again mek it appearance.”</p>
<p>Inna anodda place—p. 45,—im taak bout “ <i>di mysterious an mortal attack a di animal</i> .”</p>
<p>Secondly: Di ship Union, weh a Nantucket tu, did inna di year 1807 totally lost off di Azores by a similar onset, but di authentic particulars a dis catastrophe mi neva chance fi encounter, though fram di whale hunters mi have now an den hear casual allusions to it.</p>
<p>Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, den commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happen fi be dining wid a party a whaling captains, pan board a Nantucket ship inna di harbor a Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, di Commodore did pleased fi be skeptical touching di amazing strength weh di professional gentlemen dem did deh deh did ascribe to dem. Im peremptorily denied fi example, seh any whale coulda so smite im stout sloop-of-war as to cause har fi leak so much as a thimbleful. Gud gud; but more a come. Some weeks afta, di Commodore set sail inna dis impregnable craft fi Valparaiso. But him did get stop pan di way by a portly sperm whale, weh beg fi a few moments' confidential business wid him. Dat deh business deh did consist inna fetching di Commodore's craft such a thwack, dat wid all him pumps going him mek straight fi di nearest port fi heave dung an repair. Mi no superstitious, but mi consider di Commodore's interview wid dat deh whale as providential. No Saul a Tarsus did convert fram unbelief by a similar fright? Mi tell yuh, di sperm whale naa go stan no nonsense.</p>
<p>Mi ago now refer yuh to Langsdorff's Voyages fi a likkle circumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to di writer hereof. Langsdorff, yuh mus know by di way, did attached to di Russian Admiral Krusenstern's famous Discovery Expedition inna di beginning a di present century. Captain Langsdorff staat him seventeenth chapter so:</p>
<p>“By di thirteenth a May wi ship did ready fi sail, an di nex day wi did out inna di open sea, pan wi way to Ochotsh. Di weather did very clear an fine, but so intolerably cold dat wi did haffi keep on wi fur clothes. Fi some days wi did have likkle brind. A neva til di naintienth a brisk fram Ancomon west. big whale, weh di body did biga dan di ship itself, did deh almost a di surface a di wata, but neva did si nobadi pan di ship til di moment wen di ship, weh did inna full sail, did almost pan him, so dat it neva possible fi prevent it fram strike gens him. least outa di wata. Di masts dem did a reel, an di sails dem did a fall altogether, while we weh did deh unda all spring instantly pan di deck, an concluding seh we did hit pan some rock instead a dis we did a see di monster a sail off wid di utmost gravity an solemnity weh Captain D'Wolf did a apply fi examine di pumps immediately weda dem did have any fi examine or not. damage fram di shock, but we find out seh very happily it did escape entirely uninjured.”</p>
<p>Now, di Captain D'Wolf yah alluded to as commanding di ship in question, is a New Englander, who, afta a long life a unusual adventures as a sea-captain, dis day reside inna di village a Dorchester near Boston. Mi have di honor fi be a nephew a him. Mi did particularly question him concerning dis passage inna Langsdorff. Him substantiate every word. Di ship, however, neva did a big one: a Russian craft weh dem did build pan di Siberian coast, an weh mi uncle did buy afta him did barter weh di vessel weh him did a sail fram yaad.</p>
<p>Inna dat deh up an dung manly book a old-fashioned adventure, so full, too, a honest wonders—di voyage a Lionel Wafer, one a ancient Dampier's old chums—mi find a likkle matter set dung so like dat jus quoted fram Langsdorff, dat mi cyaan forbear inserting it yah fi a corroborative example, if such needed.</p>
<p>Lionel, it look like, did deh pan him way to “John Ferdinando,” as him call di modern Juan Fernandes. “Inna wi way deh,” him seh, “bout four o'clock inna di maanin, wen wi did deh bout one hundred an fifty leagues fram di Main a America, wi ship did feel a terrible shock, weh put wi man dem inna such consternation dat dem couldn't hardly tell weh dem did deh or weh fi tink; but every one staat prepare fi death. An, inna di shock, so violent, we did so shak an so violent, dat wi did shook it so sudden. fi granted di ship did hit gens a rock; but wen di amazement did a likkle ova, wi did a fling di lead, an did a sound, but neva find no ground. Lionel den go on fi impute di shock to an earthquake, an seems fi substantiate di imputation by stating dat a great earthquake, somewhere bout dat time, did actually do great mischief along di Spanish lan. But mi shudn't much wonder if, inna di darkness a dat deh early hour a di morning, di shock was afta all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping di hull fram beath.</p>
<p>Mi might proceed wid several more examples, one way or another weh mi know, a di great power an malice at times a di sperm whale. In more dan one instance, him have been known, not only fi chase di assailing boats dem back to dem ships, but fi pursue di ship itself, an long withstand all di lances dem weh dem did a hurl at him fram it decks. Di English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story pan dat deh head; an, as fi him strength, mek mi seh, dat deh have examples weh di lines dem weh did attached to a running sperm whale, inna a calm, get transfer to di ship, an secure deh; di whale towing har great hull thru di wata, as a horse walk off wid a cart. Again, it is very often observed dat, if di sperm whale, once hit, is allowed time to rally, him den act, not so often wid blind rage, as wid wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to him pursuers; nor is it widout conveying some eloquent indication of him character, dat upon get attack him will frequently open him mout, an retain it inna dat deh dread expansion fi several consecutive minutes. But mi haffi be content wid only one more an a concluding illustration; a remarkable an most significant one, by which yuh naa go fail fi see, dat not only is di most marvelous event inna dis book corroborated by plain facts of di present day, but dat dem marvels (like all marvels) a mere repetitions a di ages; so fi di millionth time wi seh amen wid Solomon—Verily nuh nutten nuh deh unda di sun.</p>
<p>Inna di sixth Christian century did live Procopius, a Christian magistrate a Constantinople, inna di days wen Justinian was Emperor an Belisarius general. As many know, him write di history a him own times, a work every way of uncommon value. By di bes authorities, him always been considered a most trustworthy an unexaggerating historian, except inna some one or two particulars, not at all affecting di matter presently fi be mentioned.</p>
<p>Now, inna dis history a him, Procopius mention seh, during di term a him prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster did get capture inna di neighboring Propontis, or Sea of ​​Marmora, afta him did destroy vessels at intervals inna dem waters deh fi a period a more dan fifty years. A fact weh set dong inna substantial history cyaan easily be gainsaid. No reason nuh deh fi it be. A weh precise species dis sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as him did destroy ships, as well as fi other reasons, him mosi did a whale; an mi strongly inclined fi tink a sperm whale. An mi ago tell yuh why. Fi a long time mi did a fancied seh di sperm whale did always unknown inna di Mediterranean an di deep waters weh did a connect wid it. Even now mi certain seh dem seas deh nuh, an perhaps neva can be, inna di present constitution a tings, a place fi him habitual gregarious resort. But furda investigations don recently prove to mi, seh inna modern times deh have isolated instances a di presence a di sperm whale inna di Mediterranean. Dem tell mi, pan good authority, seh pan di Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis a di British navy find di skeleton a one sperm whale. Now, as a vessel a war readily pass thru di Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale coulda, by di same route, pass outa di Mediterranean into di Propontis.</p>
<p>Inna di Propontis, as far as mi can learn, none a dat deh peculiar substance weh dem call <i>brit</i> is fi find, di aliment a di right whale. But mi have every reason fi believe seh di food a di sperm whale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at di bottom a dat deh sea, cause big creatures, but by no means di largest a dat deh sort, have been found at it surface. If, den, yuh properly put dem statements yah tugeda, an reason pan dem a bit, yuh wi clearly perceive seh, according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, dat fi half a century stove di ships a one Roman Emperor, must in all probability been a sperm whale.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00051">CHAPTER 46. Surmises.</h2>
<p>Though, consumed wid di hot fire a him purpose, Ahab inna all him thoughts an actions eva did have in view di ultimate capture a Moby Dick; though him did look ready fi sacrifice all mortal interests to dat deh one passion; nevertheless it may have been dat him was by nature an long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways, altogether fi abandon di collateral prosecution a di voyage. Or at least if dis was otherwise, dem neva waan ada motives much more influential wid him. It woulda be refining too much, perhaps, even considering him monomania, fi hint dat him vindictiveness towards di White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, an dat di more monsters him slew by so much di more him multiplied di chances dat each subsequently encountered whale woulda prove fi be di one him hated. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, deh did still have additional considerations weh, though not so strictly according to di wildness a him ruling passion, yet neva means incapable fi sway him.</p>
<p>Fi accomplish him object Ahab haffi use tools; an a all tools weh dem use inna di shadow a di moon, man dem most apt fi get out a order. Im did know, fi example, seh how magnetic im ascendency inna some respects did ova Starbuck, yet dat ascendency neva cover di complete spiritual man any more dan mere corporeal superiority involve intellectual mastership; fi di purely spiritual, di intellectual but stand inna a sort a corporeal relation. Starbuck's body an Starbuck's coerced will was Ahab's, so long as Ahab keep him magnet at Starbuck's brain; still him did know seh fi all dis di chief mate, inna him soul, did abhorred him captain's quest, an could him, woulda joyfully disintegrate himself fram it, or even frustrate it. It might be dat a long interval woulda elapse ere di White Whale was seen. Durin dat deh long interval Starbuck woulda eva be apt fi fall inna open relapses a rebellion against him captain's leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences did bring to bear upon him. Not only dat, but di subtle insanity a Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested dan inna him superlative sense an shrewdness inna foreseeing dat, fi di present, di hunt shuda in some way be stripped a dat deh strange imaginative impiousness weh naturally invest it; dat di full terror a di voyage haffi be kept widdrawn inna di obscure background (fi few man's courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action); dat wen dem did a stan op fi dem long night watch, him officers an man dem mus have some nearer tings fi tink bout dan Moby Dick. For how eagerly an impetuously di savage crew did hail di announcement a him quest; yet all sailors a all sorts are more or less capricious an unreliable—dem live inna di varying outer weather, an dem inhale its fickleness—an wen dem retain dem fi any object remote an blank inna di pursuit, however promissory a life an passion inna di end, it is above all tings requisite dat temporary interests an employments shuda intervene an hold dem fi di finaly healthy chrow.</p>
<p>Ahab neva unmindful a anoda ting. In times a strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent. Di permanent constitutional condition a di manufactured man, tink Ahab, a sordidness. Granting dat di White Whale fully incite di hearts a dis mi savage crew, an playing round dem savageness even breeds a certain generous knight-errantism inna dem, still, while fi di love a it dem gi chase to Moby Dick, dem must also have food fi dem more common, daily appetites. For even di high lifted an chivalric Crusaders a old times neva content fi traverse two thousand miles a lan fi fight fi dem holy sepulchre, widout committing burglaries, picking pockets, an gaining other pious perquisites by di way. If dem did strictly hold to dem one final an romantic object—dat final an romantic object, too many woulda turn fram inna disgust. Mi naa go tek weh dem man yah, Ahab did tink, a all hopes a cash—aye, cash. Dem maita scorn cash now; but mek some months go by, an no perspective promise a it to dem, an den dis same quiescent cash all at once mutinying inna dem, dis same cash woulda soon cashier Ahab.</p>
<p>Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally. Afta impulsively, it is probable, an perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed di prime but private purpose a di Pequod's voyage, Ahab did now entirely conscious seh, inna so doing, him did indirectly laid himself open to di unanswerable charge a usurpation; an wid perfect impunity, both moral an legal, him crew if so disposed, an to dat end competent, coulda refuse all further obedience to him, an even violently wrest fram him di command. Fram even di barely hinted imputation a usurpation, an di possible consequences a such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab mus of course have been most anxious fi protect himself. Dat deh protection coulda only consist inna him own predominating brain an heart an han, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence weh it was possible fi him crew be subjected to.</p>
<p>Fi all dem reasons deh den, an others perhaps too analytic fi be verbally developed yah, Ahab plainly si seh him haffi still inna a good degree continue true to di natural, nominal purpose a di Pequod's voyage; observe all customary usages; an not only dat, but force himself fi evince all him well known passionate interest inna di general pursuit a him profession.</p>
<p>Be all dis as it may, him voice was now often heard hailing di three mast-heads an admonishing dem fi keep a bright look-out, an not omit reporting even a porpoise. Dis vigilance neva tek lang widout reward.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00052">CHAPTER 47. Di Mat-Maker.</h2>
<p>A did a cloudy, sultry aftanuun; di seamen dem did a lazily lounging bout di decks, or vacantly gazing ova inna di lead-coloured waters. Queequeg an mi did a mildly employed weaving weh dem call a sword-mat, fi an additional lashing to wi boat. So still an subdued an yet somehow preluding was all di scene, an such an incantation a reverie lurked inna di air, dat each silent sailor seemed resolved inna him own invisible self.</p>
<p>Mi was di attendant or page a Queequeg, wile mi did busy a di mat. As mi did a pass an repass di filling or woof a marline between di long yarns a di warp, a use mi own han fi di shuttle, an as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever an anon slid him heavy oaken sword between di threads, an idly looking off upon di water, carelessly an unthinkingly drive home everyting so strange mi did dren: reign all ova di ship an all ova di sea, only broken by di intermitting dull sound a di sword, dat it did look like dis was di Loom of Time, an miself was a shuttle mechanically weaving an weaving away at di Fates. Deh did lay di fixed threads a di warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, an dat deh vibration merely enough fi admit a di crosswise interblending a ada threads wid it own. Dis warp did look necessity; an yahso, mi did tink, wid mi own han mi a ply mi own shuttle an weave mi own destiny inna dem unalterable threads yah. Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting di woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as di case might be; an by dis difference inna di concluding blow weh produce a corresponding contrast inna di final aspect a di completed fabric; dis savage's sword, mi did tink, weh so finally shape an fashion both warp an woof; dis easy, indifferent sword mus be chance—aye, chance, free will, an necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working together. Di straight warp a necessity, not fi be swerved fram its ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to dat; free will still free fi ply har shuttle between given threads; an chance, though restrained inna it play widin di right lines a necessity, an sideways inna it motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, an have di last featuring blow at events.</p>
<p>So wi did a weave an weave weh wen mi staat at a sound so strange, long drawn, an musically wild an unearthly, dat di ball a free will drop fram mi han, an mi stan up a look up at di clouds weh dat deh voice did a drop like a wing fram. High aloft inna di cross-trees was dat deh mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. Him body did a reach eagerly forward, him han did a stretch out like a wand, an at brief sudden intervals him did a continue him cries. Fi be sure di same sound was dat deh very moment perhaps being heard all ova di seas, fram hundreds a whalemen's look-outs perched as high inna di air; but fram few a dem lungs deh coulda dat accustomed old cry have derived such a marvelous cadence as fram Tashtego di Indian's.</p>
<p>As him did a stan op a hover ova yuh half suspended inna di air, so wildly an eagerly a look towards di horizon, yuh woulda tink seh him a some prophet or seer a beholding di shadows a Fate, an by dem wild cries deh a announce dem coming.</p>
<p>“Dem de shi blod! de! de! de! shi blod! shi blod!”</p>
<p>“Weh-away?”</p>
<p>“Pan di lee-beam, bout two miles off! a school a dem!”</p>
<p>Instantly all was commotion.</p>
<p>Di Sperm Whale blow as a clock ticks, wid di same undeviating an reliable uniformity. An so whalemen distinguish dis fish fram ada tribes a him genus.</p>
<p>“Dem go flukes!” was now di cry fram Tashtego; an di wail animal dem disapier.</p>
<p>“Quick, steward!” Ahab baal out. “Time! time!”</p>
<p>Dough-Boy hurry dung, glance at di watch, an report di exact minute to Ahab.</p>
<p>Di ship did now keep weh fram di wind, an she did a go gently rolling before it. Tashtego reporting seh di whales dem did go dung heading to leeward, we confidently look fi see dem again directly in advance a wi bows. Fi dat singular craft at times evinced by di Sperm Whale wen, sounding wid him head inna one direction, him nevertheless, while concealed unda di surface, mills round, an swiftly swim off inna di opposite quarter—dis deceitfulness a him couldn't now be inna action; kaa deh neva have no reason fi suppose seh di fish dem weh Tashtego did si did inna any way alarmed, or indeed did know at all a wi vicinity. One a di man dem weh dem did select fi shipkeepers—dat is, dem weh neva did appoint to di boats, by dis time did relieve di Indian dem at di main-mast head. Di sailors dem at di fore an mizzen did come dung; di line tubs dem did fix inna dem place; di cranes dem did thrust out; di mainyard did back, an di three boat dem did a swing ova di sea like three samphire baskets ova high cliffs. Outside a di bulwarks dem eager crews wid one han clung to di rail, while one foot did expectantly poised pan di gunwale. So look di long line a man-of-war's man dem bout fi fling demself pan board a enemy ship.</p>
<p>But at dis critical instant a sudden exclamation did hear weh tek every eye fram di whale. Wid a staat all glared at dark Ahab, who did surrounded by five dusky phantoms weh did look fresh formed outa air.</p>
