<p>Di predestinated day arrive, an wi duly meet di ship Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, a Bremen.</p>
<p>At one time di greatest whaling people inna di worl, di Dutch an Germans dem deh now mongst di least; but yah an deh at very wide intervals a latitude an longitude, yuh still occasionally meet wid dem flag inna di Pacific.</p>
<p>Fi some reason, di Jungfrau did look quite eager fi pay har respects. While yet some distance fram di Pequod, she round to, an drop a boat, har captain did a impelled towards wi, impatiently standing inna di bows instead a di stern.</p>
<p>“Weh him have inna him han deh?” Starbuck baal out, a point to someting weh di German did a hold. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”</p>
<p>“Not dat,” seh Stubb, “no, no, a one coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; him a come off fi mek wi wi coffee, a di Yarman; yuh nuh see dat deh big tin can deh deh alongside a him?—dat a him boiling water. Oh! him all right, a di Yarman.”</p>
<p>“Gwaan wid yu,” Flask baal out, “a wan lamp-fiida an wan ail-kan. Im outa ail, an im kom a-beg.”</p>
<p>However curious it may seem fi an oil-ship fi be borrowing oil pan di whale-ground, an how much it may invertedly contradict di ole proverb bout carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a ting really happen; an inna di present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.</p>
<p>As him did a goh pan di deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, widout at all heading weh him did have inna him han; but inna him broken lingo, di German soon evinced him complete ignorance a di White Whale; immediately turn di conversation to him lamp-feeder an oil can, wid some remarks touching him having to turn inna him hammock at night inna profound darkness—him last drop a Bremen oil been gone, an not a single flying-fish yet captured fi supply di deficiency; concluding by hinting dat him ship was indeed weh inna di Fishery dem technically called a <i>clean</i> one (dat is, an empty one), well deserving di name a Jungfrau or di Virgin.</p>
<p>Him necessities supplied, Derick departed; but him neva get him ship's side, wen whales did almost simultaneously raise fram di mast-heads a both vessels; an so eager fi di chase was Derick, dat widout pausing fi put him oil-can an lamp-feeder abord, him slewed round him boat an mek afta di leviathan lamp-feeders.</p>
<p>Now, di game did rise to leeward, him an di ada three German boats dem weh soon did a follow him, did have considerably di staat a di Pequod's keels. Dem did have eight whales, an average pod. Aware a dem danger, dem did a go all abreast wid great speed straight before di wind, a rub dem flanks as closely as so many spans a horses inna harness. Dem lef a big, wide wake, as if dem did a unroll a big wide parchment pan di sea.</p>
<p>Full inna dis rapid wake, an plenty fathoms inna di rear, swim a huge, humped old bull, weh by him comparatively slow progress, as well as by di unusual yellowish incrustations weh did a overgrow him, did look like him did a aflicted wid di jaundice, or some ada infirmity. Weda dis whale did belong to di pod in advance, it did look questionable; fi it no customary fi such venerable leviathans fi be at all social. Nevertheless, him stick to dem wake, though indeed dem back water must have retarded him, cause di white-bone or swell at him broad muzzle was a dashed one, like di swell formed wen two hostile currents meet. Him spout did short, slow, an laborous; coming forth wid a choking sort a gush, an spending itself inna torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions inna him, weh did look like it did a egress at him other buried extremity, causing di waters behind him fi upbubble.</p>
<p>“A who have some paregoric?” Stubb seh, "im have di stomach-ache, mi fraid. Lord, tink bout half an acre a stomach-ache! Adverse winds a hold mad Christmas inna him, bwoy. A di first foul wind mi eva know fi blow fram astern; but look, did eva whale yaw so before? it mus be him tiller."</p>
<p>As an overladen Indiaman bearing dung di Hindostan coast wid a deck load a frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, an wallows pan har way; so did dis old whale heave him aged bulk, an now an den partly turning ova pan him cumbrous rib-ends, expose di cause a him devious wake inna di unnatural stump a him starboard fin. Weda him did lose dat deh fin inna battle, or him did born widout it, it did hard fi seh.</p>
<p>“Only wait a bit, old chap, an mi ago gi yuh a sling fi dat deh wounded arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to di whale-line near him.</p>
<p>“Mind him no sling yuh wid it,” Starbuck baal out. “Gi way, or di German ago have him.”</p>
<p>Wid one intent all di combined rival boats dem did a point fi dis one fish, cause not only him was di largest, an therefore di most valuable whale, but him did deh nearest to dem, an di ada whales dem did a go wid such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit fi di time. At dis juncture di Pequod's keels dem did shot by di three German boats dem weh did last lower; but fram di great staat him did have, Derick's boat still did a lead di chase, though every moment near by him foreign rivals. Di ongl ting dem did fraid, was, dat fram being already so nier to him mark, him woulda be enabled fi dart him iron before dem coulda completely overtake an pass him. As fi Derick, him did look quite confident seh dis woulda be di case, an occasionally wid a deriding gesture shiek him lamp-feeder at di ada boats dem.</p>
<p>“Di ungracious an ungrateful dog!” Starbuck did a baal out; “im mock an dare mi wid di very poor-box weh mi did full fi him not five minutes ago!”—den inna him old intense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!”</p>
<p>“Mi tell unu weh it is, man”—Stubb baal out tu him crew—“it's against mi religion fi get mad; but mi woulda like fi eat dat deh villainous Yarman—Pull—won't yuh? Unu a go mek dat deh rascal beat yuh? Yuh love brandy? A hogshead a brandy, den, to di bes man come, why yuh no burst some a blood? A who a drop an anchor ovaboard—we nuh budge an inch—wi becalmed Halloo, yahso a grass a grow inna di boat bottom—an by di Lord, di mast deh a go do, bwoy dem! Look pon dat Yarman!</p>
<p>“Oh! si di suds weh him mek!” Flask baal out, a daans op an dong—“Wat a hump—Oh, <i>do</i> pile pan di biif—lays laik a log! Oh! mi lads, <i>do</i> spring—slap-jacks an quahogs fi supper, yuh nuo, mi lads—baked clams an muffins—oh, <i>do</i> , <i>do</i> , spring,—im a wan onjrid barreller—don’t lose him—no lose him now, <i>oh!</i> —see dat Yarman—Oh, yuh naa go pull fi <i>yuh</i> duff, mi lads—such a sogger <i>! Yuh no</i> <i>love</i> sperm?</p>
<p>At dis moment Derick did a pitch him lamp-feeder at di advancing boats, an also him oil-can; perhaps wid di double view a retarding him rivals' way, an at di same time economicically accelerate him own by di momentary impetus a di backward toss.</p>
<p>“Di unmannerly Dutch dogger!” Stubb baal out. “Pull now, man, like fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads a red-haired devils. Weh yuh seh, Tashtego; yuh a di man fi snap yuh spine inna two-an-twenty pieces fi di honor a old Gayhead? Weh yuh seh?”</p>
<p>“Mi seh, pull like god-dam,”—di Indian baal out.</p>
<p>Fiercely, but evenly incited by di taunts a di German, di Pequod's three boats now staat range almost abreast; an, so disposed, momentarily near him. Inna dat deh fine, loose, chivalrous attitude a di headsman wen him did a draw near to him prey, di three mates dem did a stan up proudly, occasionally backing di after oarsman wid an exhilarating cry a, “There she slides, now! Hurray fi di white-ash breeze! Down wid di Yarman! Sail ova him!”</p>
<p>But so decided an original start if Derick did have, dat spite a all dem gallantry, him woulda prove di victor inna dis race, if a neva a righteous judgment descended upon him inna a crab weh ketch di blade a him midship oarsman. While dis clumsy lubber did a strive fi free him white-ash, an while, in consequence, Derick's boat did nier fi capsize, an him did a thunder weh at him man dem inna a mighty rage;—dat was a good time fi Starbuck, Stubb, an Flask. Wid a shout, dem tek a mortal start forwards, an slantingly range up pan di German's quarter. An instant more, an all four boats dem did diagonically inna di whale's immediate wake, while stretching fram dem, pan both sides, was di foaming swell weh him mek.</p>
<p>It was a terrific, most pitiable, an maddening sight. Di whale did a go head out now, an a sen him spout before him inna a continual tormented jet; while him one poor fin beat him side inna an agony a fright. Now to dis hand, now to dat, him yawed inna him faltering flight, an still at every billow weh him break, him spasmodically sink inna di sea, or sideways roll towards di sky him one beating fin. So mi si a bird wid clipped wing a mek affrighted broken circles inna di air, vainly striving fi escape di piratical hawks. But di bird have a voice, an wid plaintive cries she mek known har fear; but di fear a dis vast dumb brute a di sea, did chain up an enchanted inna him; him neva have no voice, except dat choking respiration thru him spiracle, an dis mek di sight a him unspeakably pitiable; while still, inna him amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, an omnipotent tail, deh did have enough fi appal di stoutest man weh so pitied.</p>
<p>Seeing now dat but a very few moments more woulda gi di Pequod's boats dem di advantage, an rather dan be thus foiled a him game, Derick choose fi hazard weh to him mus did look like a most unusually long dart, ere di last chance woulda fi eva escape.</p>
<p>But no sooner did him harpooneer stan up fi di stroke, dan all three tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively spring to dem feet, an standing inna a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed dem barbs; an darted ova di head a di German harpooneer, dem three Nantucket irons enter di whale. Blinding vapors of foam an white-fire! Di three boats dem, inna di first fury a di whale headlong rush, bump di German dem aside wid such force, dat both Derick an him baffled harpooneer did spill out, an sail ova by di three flying keels.</p>
<p>“No fried, mi butter-box dem,” Stubb baal out, a kaas wan passing glance pan dem az im shot by; “yu wi get pik op rait ya nou—aal rait—mi si som shark astern—St. Bernard's dog dem, yu nuo—reliev distressed travellers. Hurrah! dis a di wie fi sail nou. Every keel a sunbeam! Hurrah!—Yah wi go laik chrii tin kettles a di tail a wan madgar an put ina mi main dis fi put mi main! elephant inna a tilbury pan a plain—mek di wheel-spokes fly, bwoy dem, an yuh have danger fi get pitch out too, wen yuh strike a hill—all a rush dung an endless planeash inna di maillesting!</p>
<p>But di monster's run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, him tumultuously sound. Wid a grating rush, di three lines dem fly roun di loggerheads wid such a force as to gouge deep grooves inna dem; while so fearful did di harpooneers dem dat dis rapid sounding woulda soon exhaust di lines, dat using all dem dexterous power, dem ketch repeated smoking turns wid di rope fi hold on; til at last—owing to di perpendicular strain fram di lead-lined chocks a di boats, weh di three ropes dem did go straight dung inna di blue—di gunwales a di bows dem did almost even wid di wata, while di three sterns did tilt high inna di air. An di whale soon ceasing to sound, fi some time dem remain inna dat deh attitude, fearful fi expending more line, though di position did a likkle ticklish. But though boats dem tek dung an lost inna dis way, yet a dis “holding on,” as it is called; dis hooking up by di sharp barbs a him live flesh fram di back; dis it is dat often torments di Leviathan into soon rising again fi meet di sharp lance a him foes. Yet not fi taak bout di peril a di ting, it fi be doubted weda dis course is always di bes; fi it is but reasonable fi presume, seh di longer di stricken whale stay unda water, di more him get exhausted. Bikaaz, owing to di enormous surface a him—in a full grown sperm whale someting less dan 2000 square feet—di pressure a di wata is immense. Wi all know weh an astonishing atmospheric weight wiself stan up unda; even yah, above-ground, inna di air; how vast, den, di burden a one whale, bearing pan him back a column a two hundred fathoms a ocean! It haffi at least equal di weight a fifty atmospheres. One whaleman estimate it at di weight a twenty line-of-battle ships, wid all dem guns, an stores, an man pan board.</p>
<p>As di three boats dem did a lay deh pan dat deh gently rolling sea, gazing dung inna it eternal blue noon; an as not a single groan or cry a any sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble come up fram it depths; weh landsman woulda did tink, dat unda all dat deh silence an placidity, di utmost monster a di seas did a writhing an wrenching inna agony! Not eight inches a perpendicular rope did visible at di bows. It look like it credible seh by three such thin threads di great Leviathan did suspended like di big weight to an eight day clock. Did suspen? an to weh? To three bits a board. Dis a di creature weh dem did se so triumphantly bout—“Yuh can fill him skin wid barbed irons, or him head wid fish-spears? Di sword fi him weh laye pan him cyaan hold, di spear, di dart, nor di habergeon: him consider iron as straw, di arrow cyaan mek him smart; at di shaking a one spear!” Dis a di creature? dis him? Awo! dat unfulfilmments shuda follow di prophets. For wid di strength a one thousand thighs inna him tail, Leviathan did run him head unda di mountains a di sea, fi hide him fram di Pequod's fish-spears!</p>
<p>Inna dat deh sloping aftanuun sunlight, di shadows dem weh di three boats dem did sen dung unda di surface, mosi did long enough an broad enough fi shade half Xerxes army. Who can tell how appalling to di wounded whale mus been such huge phantoms flitting ova him head!</p>
<p>“Stand by, man; him stir,” cried Starbuck, as di three lines dem suddenly vibrate inna di wata, distinctly conducting upwards to dem, as by magnetic wires, di life an death throbs a di whale, so dat every oarsman did a feel dem inna him seat. Di neks moment, relieved in great part fram di downward strain at di bows, di boats dem gi a sudden bounce upwards, as a likkle icefield will, wen a dense herd a white bears get scared fram it inna di sea.</p>
<p>“Haul in! Haul in!” Starbuck baal out agen; “im a rise.”</p>
<p>Di lines dem, weh, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth coulda have been gained, did now inna long quick coils fling back all dripping inna di boats, an soon di whale break water widin two ship's lengths a di hunters.</p>
<p>Him motions plainly denote him extreme exhaustion. Inna most lan animal dem have certain valves or flood-gates inna plenty a dem veins, weh wen dem wound, di blood deh inna some degree at least instantly shut off inna certain directions. Not so wid di whale; one a whose peculiarities it is fi have an entire non-valvular structure a di blood-vessels, so dat wen dem pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once began upon him whole arterial system; an wen dis is heightened by di extraordinary pressure a water at a great distance below di surface, him life may be said fi pour fram him inna incessant streams. Yet so vast is di quantity a blood inna him, an so distant an numerous its interior fountains, dat him ago keep thus bleeding an bleeding fi a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is inna di well-springs a far-off an undiscernible hills. Even now, wen di boats dem did a pull pan dis whale, an perilously draw ova him swaying flukes, an di lances dem did a dart inna him, dem did a follow by steady jets fram di new made wound, weh did a keep continually playing, while di natural spout-hole inna him head did only at intervals, however rapid, sending it affrighted moisture inna di air. Fram dis laas vent no blood neva come yet, cause no vital part a him neva get hit so far. Him life, as dem significantly call it, was untouched.</p>
<p>As di boats dem now more closely surround him, di whole upper part a him form, wid much a it weh ordinarily submerged, did plainly reveal. Him eyes, or rather di places weh him eyes dem did deh, did beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather inna di knot-holes a di noblest oaks wen dem prostrate, so fram di points weh di whale's eyes dem did once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable fi see. But pity neva deh deh. Fi all him old age, an him one arm, an him blind eyes, him haffi dead di death an get murdered, fi light di gay bridals an other merry-makings a man, an also fi illuminate di solemn churches dem weh preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still a roll inna him blood, at last him partially disclose a strangely discolored bunch or protuberance, di size a one bushel, low dung pan di flank.</p>
<p>“A nice spot,” Flask baal out; “jus mek mi prick him deh once.”</p>
<p>“Avast!” Starbuck baal out, “no niid fi dat!”</p>
<p>But humane Starbuck did too late. At di instant a di dart wan ulcerous jet shot fram dis cruel wound, an goaded by it into more dan sufferable anguish, di whale now a spout thick blood, wid swift fury blindly darted at di craft, bespattering dem an dem glorying crews all ova wid showers a gore, capsizing Flask's boat an marring di bows. A did him death stroke. For, by dis time, so spent him did a loss a blood, dat him helplessly roll weh fram di wreck weh him did mek; lay panting pan him side, impotently flapped wid him stumped fin, den ova an ova slowly revolve like a waning world; turn up di white secrets a him belly; lay like a log, an dead. It was most piteous, dat last expiring spout. As wen by unseen hands di wata get gradually draw off fram some mighty fountain, an wid half-stifled melancholy gurglings di spray-column lowers an lowers to di ground—so di last long dying spout a di whale.</p>
<p>Soon, while di crews dem did a wait di arrival a di ship, di body did a show symptoms a sinking wid all a it treasures unrifled. Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines did secure to it at different points, so dat ere long every boat was a buoy; di sunken whale weh did a suspen a few inches unda dem by di cords. By very heedful management, wen di ship did a draw nigh, di whale did get transfer to har side, an did strongly secure deh by di stiffest fluke-chains, fi it was plain dat unless artificially upheld, di body woulda at once sink to di bottom.</p>
<p>It so chanced dat almost upon first cutting inna him wid di spade, di entire length a one corroded harpoon did find imbedded inna him flesh, pan di lower part a di bunch before dem did describe. But as di stumps a harpoons dem frequently find inna di dead bodies a captured whales, wid di flesh perfectly healed roun dem, an no prominence a any kind fi denote dem place; so, it mus need fi have some ada unknown reason inna di present case fully fi account fi di ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was di fact seh a lance-head a stone did deh inna him, not far fram di buried iron, di flesh perfectly firm bout it. A who did dart dat deh stone lance? An wen? It mighta did get dart by some Nor' West Indian long before dem did discover America.</p>
<p>Weh ada marvels mighta did rummaged outa dis monstrous cabinet deh no telling. But a sudden stop did put to further discoveries, by di ship's being unprecedentedly drag ova sideways to di sea, owing to di body's immensely increasing tendency fi sink. However, Starbuck, who did have di ordering a affairs, did a hang on to it to di last; hang on to it so resolutely, indeed, dat wen at length di ship woulda been capsized, if still persisting inna locking arms wid di body; den, wen di command did gi fi break clear fram it, such was di immovable strain pan di timber-heads dem weh di fluke-chains an cables did fasten to, dat it was impossible fi cast dem off. Meantime everyting inna di Pequod did aslant. Fi cross to di ada side a di deck was like walk up di steep gabled roof a one house. Di ship did a groan an gasp. Plenty a di ivory inlayings a har bulwarks an cabins dem did staat fram dem place, by di unnatural dislocation. Inna vain handspikes an crows dem did bring fi bear pan di immovable fluke-chains, fi pry dem adrift fram di timberheads; an so low did di whale now settle dat di submerged ends dem couldn't at all approach, while every moment whole tons a ponderosity did a add to di sinking bulk, an di ship did a look pan di point a go ova.</p>
<p>“Hold on, hold on, yuh noh so?” Stubb baal out tu di badi, "no bada inna soch a devl a hurry fi sink! By thunder, man, wi afi du sopm ar go fi it. No yuus a priy de; avast, mi se wid yu hanspikes, an ron wan a unu fi wahn prieya buk an wahn pen-naif, an kot di big chien dem."</p>
<p>“Knife? Aye, aye,” Queequeg baal out, an grab di carpenter's heavy hatchet, im lean outa a porthole, an steel to iron, staat slash pan di largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full a sparks, did gi, wen di exceeding strain did a effect di rest. Wid a terrific snap, every fastening go adrift; di ship right, di carcase sink.</p>
<p>Now, dis occasional inevitable sinking a di recently killed Sperm Whale a one very curious ting; nor have no fisherman yet adequately accounted fi it. Usually di dead Sperm Whale float wid great buoyancy, wid it side or belly considerably elevated above di surface. If di ongl whales dem weh did sink so did uol, meagre, an broken-hearted creatures, dem pads a lard diminished an all dem bones heavy an rheumatic; den yuh might wid some reason assert seh dis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity inna di fish so sinking, consequent upon dis absence a buoyant matter inna him. But it nuh so. Fi di young whales, inna di highest health, an swelling wid noble aspirations, prematurely cut off inna di warm flush an May a life, wid all dem panting lard bout dem; even dem brawny, buoyant heroes deh sometimes sink.</p>
<p>Be it seh, however, dat di Sperm Whale is far less liable to dis accident dan any ada species. Weh one a dat deh sort go dung, twenty Right Whales do. Dis difference inna di species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to di greater quantity a bone inna di Right Whale; him Venetian blinds alone sometimes weigh more dan a ton; fram dis incumbrance di Sperm Whale is wholly free. But deh deh instances weh, afta di lapse a many hours or several days, di sunken whale again rise, more buoyant dan inna life. But di reason fi dis is obvious. Gases dem generate inna him; him swell to a prodigious magnitude; ton a sort a animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship coulda hardly keep him unda den. Inna di Shore Whaling, pan soundings, among di Bays a New Zealand, wen a Right Whale gi token a sinking, dem fasten buoys to him, wid plenty a rope; so dat wen di badi go dong, dem nuo wich paat fi luk fi it wen it go op agen.</p>
<p>A neva lang afta di badi did a sink, dem ier wan baal fram di Pequod mast-hed dem, an a announs se di Jungfrau did a jraa dong ar boat dem agen; though di only spout in sight was dat of a Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, di Fin-Back's spout is so similar to di Sperm Whale's, dat by unskilful fishermen it often mistaken fi it. An consequently Derick an all him host dem did deh inna valiant chase a dis unnearable brute. Di Virgin crowding all sail, mek afta har four young keels, an so dem all disappear far to leeward, still inna bold, hopeful chase.</p>
<p>Awo! plenty a di Fin-Backs, an plenty a di Dericks, mi fren.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00087">CHAPTER 82. Di Honor an Glory a Whaling.</h2>
<p>Deh have some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is di true method.</p>
<p>Di more mi dive inna dis matter a whaling, an push mi researches up to di very spring-head a it so much di more mi am impress wid its great honorableness an antiquity; an especially wen mi find so much great demi-gods an heroes, prophets a all sorts, who one way or other have shed distinction upon it, mi get transported wid di reflection seh miself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.</p>
<p>Di gallant Perseus, a son a Jupiter, was di first whaleman; an to di eternal honor a wi calling be it said, dat di first whale weh wi breddahood attack neva get kill wid no sordid intent. Dem deh was di knightly days a wi profession, wen wi only bore arms fi succor di distressed, an not fi fill man's lamp-feeders. Every one know di fine story a Perseus an Andromeda; how di lovely Andromeda, di daughta a one king, did tie to a rock pan di sea-coast, an as Leviathan did a carry har weh, Perseus, di prince a whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned di monster, an deliver an married di maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as dis Leviathan did get slain at di very first dart. An mek nobadi doubt dis Arkite story; fi inna di ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, pan di Syrian coast, inna one a di Pagan temples, deh did stan fi many ages di vast skeleton a one whale, weh di city's legends an all di inhabitants asserted fi be di identical bones a di monster weh Perseus did slew. Wen di Romans dem tek Joppa, dem carry di same skeleton to Italy inna triumph. Weh look most singular an suggestively important inna dis story, a dis: a did fram Joppa weh Jonah set sail.</p>
<p>Akin to di adventure a Perseus an Andromeda—indeed, by some supposed fi be indirectly derived fram it—a dat deh famous story a St. George an di Dragon; weh dragon mi maintain seh a did a whale; fi inna nuff uol chronicles whales an dragons dem strangely jumbled tugeda, an often stan fi each ada. “Yuh a like a lion a di waters, an a dragon a di sea,” seh Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions a di Bible use dat deh word itself. Besides, it woulda much subtract fram di glory a di exploit had St. George but encounter a crawling reptile a di lan, instead a do battle wid di great monster a di deep. Any man can kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have di heart inna dem fi march boldly up to a whale.</p>
<p>No mek di modern painting dem a dis scene mislead wi; fi though di creature weh dat deh valiant whaleman a old did encounter is vaguely represented a griffin-like shape, an though di battle is depicted pan lan an di saint pan horseback, yet considering di great ignorance a dem time deh, wen di true form a di whale neva know to artists; an considering dat as in Perseus' case, St. George's whale mighta did crawl up outa di sea pan di beach; an considering seh di animal weh St. George did a ride mighta did only a big seal, or sea-horse; bearing all dis in mind, it naa go appear altogether incompatible wid di sacred legend an di ancientest drafts a di scene, fi hold dis so-called dragon no other dan di great Leviathan himself. In fact, placed before di strict an piercing truth, dis whole story ago fare like dat deh fish, flesh, an fowl idol a di Philistinees, Dagon by name; weh wen dem did a plant infronta di ark a Israel, him horse head an di two palm a him han dem did a fall off fram him, an only di stump or di fishy part a him did lef. So, den, one a fi wi own noble stamp, even a whaleman, a di tutelary guardian a England; an by good rights, wi harpooneers a Nantucket shuda be enrolled inna di most noble order a St. George. An so, mek di nait dem a dat de onorable kompini (none a dem, mi venture fi se, neva av fi du wid a wail animal laik dem griet patron), mek dem neva luk pan a Nantucketer wid disdain, sins iivn ina wi wuln frock an tarred trowsers wi a muo beta entitled tu St. Georges dekorieshan dan dem.</p>
<p>Weda fi admit Hercules mongst wi or not, concerning dis mi lang remain dubious: fi though according to di Greek mythologies, dat antique Crockett an Kit Carson—dat brawny doer a rejoicing good deeds, did swallow dung an throw up by a whale; still, weda dat strictly mek a whaleman a him, dat might be mooted. It noweh appear seh him eva actually harpoon him fish, unless, indeed, fram di inside. Nevertheless, him may be considered a sort a involuntary whaleman; at any rate di whale ketch him, if him neva di whale. Mi claim him fi one a wi clan.</p>
<p>But, by di bes contradictory authorities, dis Grecian story a Hercules an di whale is considered fi be derived fram di still more ancient Hebrew story a Jonah an di whale; an vice versâ; certainly dem very similar. If mi claim di demi-god den, why not di prophet?</p>
<p>Nor no heroes, saints, demigods, an prophets alone comprise di whole roll a wi order. Wi grand master still fi be name; fi like royal kings a old times, we find di head waters a wi fraternity inna notn short a di great gods demself. Dat deh wondrous oriental story is now fi be rehearsed fram di Shaster, weh gi wi di dread Vishnoo, one a di three persons inna di godhead a di Hindoos; gi wi dis divine Vishnoo himself fi wi Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by di first a him ten earthly incarnations, have fi eva set apart an sanctify di whale. Wen Brahma, or di God a Gods, seh di Shaster, did resolve fi recreate di worl afta one a it periodical dissolutions, him gi birth to Vishnoo, fi preside ova di work; but di Vedas, or mystical books, weh dem perusal woulda look like dem did indispensable to Vishnoo before dem staat di creation, an weh so mus did contain someting inna di shape a practical hints to young architects, dem Vedas deh did deh a di bottom a di waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate inna a whale, an sounding dung inna him to di uttermost depths, rescue di sacred volumes. Dis Vishnoo neva a whaleman, den? even like a man weh ride a horse dem call a horseman?</p>
<p>Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, an Vishnoo! deh deh a member-roll fi yuh! Weh club but di whaleman dem can head off like dat?</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00088">CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.</h2>
<p>Reference was mek to di historical story a Jonah an di whale inna di preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers radda distrust dis historical story a Jonah an di whale. But den deh did have some skeptical Greeks an Romans, who, standing out fram di orthodox pagans a dem time, equally doubt di story a Hercules an di whale, an Arion an di dolphin; an yet dem doubting dem deh traditions neva mek dem deh traditions one whit di less facts, fi all dat.</p>
<p>One ole Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason fi question di Hebrew story was dis:—Im did have one a dem quaint old-fashioned Bibles, embellished wid curious, unscientific plates; one a dem did represent Jonah's whale wid two spouts inna him head—a peculiarity only true wid respect to a species a di Leviathan (di Right Whale, an di varieties a dat deh order), concerning which di fishermen dem have dis saying, “A penny roll woulda choke him”; him swallow so very small. But, to dis, Bishop Jebb's anticipative answer ready. It no necessary, hints di Bishop, dat wi consider Jonah as tombed inna di whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged inna some part a him mout. An dis look reasonable enough inna di good Bishop. Fi truly, di Right Whale's mout woulda accommodate a couple a whist-tables, an comfortably seat all di players. Possibly, too, Jonah mighta did ensconced himself inna a hollow tooth; but, pan second thoughts, di Right Whale is toothless.</p>
<p>Wan neda riizn weh Sag-Harbor (im did go bai dat de niem) did a beg fi im waahn fiet ina dis mata a di prafit, a did sopm we nobadi neva nuo bout im badi we did de ina prizn an di wail animal gastric juis dem. But dis objection likewise fall to di ground, cause a German exegetist suppose seh Jonah mus did tek refuge inna di floating body a one <i>dead</i> whale—even as di French soldiers inna di Russian campaign did turn dem dead horses inna tent, an crawl inna dem. Besides, it have been divined by other continental commentators, dat wen Jonah did get throw ovaboard fram di Joppa ship, him straightway effect him escape to anodda vessel near by, some vessel wid a whale fi a figure-head; an, mi woulda add, possibly called “Di Whale,” as some craft dem nowadays christen di “Shark,” di “Gull,” di “Eagle.” Nor have been wanting learned exegetists who have opined dat di whale mentioned inna di book a Jonah merely mean a life-preserver—an inflated bag a wind—which di endangered prophet swim to, an so was saved fram a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But him did have still anodda reason fi him waan faith. A did dis, if mi memba rait: Jonah did get swallow by di whale inna di Mediterranean Sea, an afta three days him did vomit up somwe widin three days' journey a Nineveh, a city pan di Tigris, very much more dan three days' journey across fram di nearest point a di Mediterranean coast. How dat is?</p>
<p>But was no ada way fi di whale land di prophet widin dat deh short distance a Nineveh? Yea. Him mighta did carry him roun by di way a di Cape a Good Hope. But not fi taak bout di passage thru di whole length a di Mediterranean, an anodda passage up di Persian Gulf an Red Sea, such a supposition woulda involve di complete circumnavigation a all Africa inna three days, not fi speak bout di Tigris waters, near di site a Nineveh, being too shallow fi any whale fi swim inna Jonah's Beath's idea, di Weeath's idea. a Good Hope at so early a day woulda wrest di honor a di discovery a dat deh great headland fram Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, an so mek modern history a liar.</p>
<p>But all dem foolish arguments a old Sag-Harbor only evinced him foolish pride a reason—a ting weh still more reprehensible inna him, seeing seh him did have but likkle learning except weh him did pick up fram di sun an di sea. Mi seh it only show him foolish, impious pride, an abominable, devilish rebellion against di reverend clergy. Fi by a Portuguese Catholic priest, dis very idea a Jonah's going to Nineveh via di Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of di general miracle. An a so it go. Besides, to dis day, di highly enlightened Turks dem devoutly believe inna di historical story a Jonah. An some three centuries ago, an English traveller inna old Harris's Voyages, taak bout a Turkish Mosque weh dem did build in honor a Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp weh did a burn widout any oil.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00089">CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.</h2>
<p>Fi mek dem run easily an swiftly, di axles a carriages dem anoint; an fi di same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon dem boat; dem grease di bottom. Nor is it to be doubted dat as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering dat oil an water a hostile; dat oil a one sliding ting, an dat di object in view is fi mek di boat slide bravely. Queequeg did believe strongly inna anointing him boat, an one morning not long afta di German ship Jungfrau disappear, him tek more dan customary pains inna dat deh occupation; crawling unda it bottom, weh it did a hang ova di side, an a rub inna di unctuousness as if diligently seeking fi insure a crop a hair fram di craft's bald keel. Im did look like im did a work inna obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor it did remain unwarranted by di event.</p>
<p>Towards noon whales did a raise; but so soon as di ship sail dung to dem, dem turn an run weh wid swift precipitancy; a disordered flight, as a Cleopatra's barges fram Actium.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, di boats dem pursue, an Stubb's was foremost. By great exertion, Tashtego at last succeed inna planting one iron; but di stricken whale, widout at all sounding, still continue him horizontal flight, wid added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon di planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It did become imperative fi lance di flying whale, or be content fi lose him. But fi haul di boat up to him flank was impossible, him swim so fast an furious. Weh den did lef?</p>
<p>Outa all di wondrous devices an dexterities, di sleights a hand an countless subtleties, to weh di veteran whaleman so often forced, none exceed dat fine manœuvre wid di lance weh dem call pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword, in all it exercises boast notn like it. It is only indispensable wid an inveterate running whale; its grand fact an feature is di wonderful distance to which di long lance is accurately darted fram a violently rocking, jerking boat, unda extreme headway. Steel an wood included, di entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; di staff is much slighter dan dat a di harpoon, an also a lighter material—pine. It furnished wid a likkle rope weh dem call a warp, a considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to di han afta darting.</p>
<p>But before go further, it important fi mention yah, seh though di harpoon may be pitchpoled inna di same way wid di lance, yet it is seldom done; an wen it done, it still less frequently successful, pan account a di greater weight an inferior length a di harpoon as compared wid di lance, weh in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general ting, therefore, yuh haffi get fast to a whale fos, before any pitchpoling come into play.</p>
<p>Look now pon Stubb; a man weh fram him humorous, deliberate coolness an equanimity inna di direst emergencies, did specially qualified fi excel inna pitchpoling. Luk pan im; him stan op upright inna di tossed bow a di flying boat; wrapt inna fleecy foam, di towing whale deh forty feet ahead. Handling di long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along it length fi see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gather up di coil a di warp inna one han, so as fi secure it free end inna him grasp, leaving di rest unobstructed. Den holding di lance full before him waistband's middle, him level it at di whale; wen, cover him wid it, him steadily depress di butt-end inna him han, so elevate di point til di weapon stan fairly balanced upon him palm, fifteen feet inna di air. Him mind yuh somewhat a juggler, balance a long staff pan him chin. Next moment wid a rapid, nameless impulse, inna a superb lofty arch di bright steel span di foaming distance, an quivers inna di life spot a di whale. Insted a sparkling water, him now spout red blood.</p>
<p>“Dat did drive di spigot outa him!” Stubb baal out. “'Tis July's immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it was old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Den, Tashtego, lad, mi woulda have yuh hold a canakin to di jet, an we'd drink round it! di spread a him spout-hole deh, an fram dat deh live punch-bowl quaff di living stuff.”</p>
<p>Again an again to such gamesome talk, di dexterous dart is repeated, di spear return to its master like a greyhound weh dem hold inna skilful leash. Di agonized whale go inna him flurry; di tow-line slacken, an di pitchpoler drop astern, fold him han dem, an mutely watch di monster dead.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00090">CHAPTER 85. Di Fountain.</h2>
<p>Dat fi six thousand years—an nobadi no know how many millions a ages before—di great whales dem shuda did a spout all ova di sea, an sprinkling an mistifying di gardens dem a di deep, as wid so much sprinkling or mistifying pots; an dat fi some centuries back, thousands a hunters shuda did deh close by di fountain a di whale, a watch dem sprinklings an spoutings—dat all dis shuda be, an yet, dat dung to dis blessed minute (fifteen an a quarter minutes past one o'clock PM a dis sixteenth day a December, AD 185), weda it shuda still a prablem, a, afta all, really water, or notn but vapor—dis a surely a noteworthy ting.</p>
<p>Mek wi, den, look pan dis matter, lang wid some interesting items contingent. Every one know seh by di peculiar cunning a dem gills, di finny tribes in general breathe di air weh at all times is combined wid di element in which dem swim; so, a herring or a cod might live a century, an neva once raise it head above di surface. But owing to him marked internal structure weh gi him regular lungs, like a human being's, di whale can only live by inhaling di disengaged air inna di open atmosphere. So di necessity fi him periodical visits to di upper world. But him cyaan in no degree breathe thru him mout, fi, inna him ordinary attitude, di Sperm Whale's mout beri at least eight feet anda di surface; an weh still more, him windpipe nuh have no connexion wid him mout. No, him breath thru him spiracle alone; an dis deh pan di tap a him head.</p>
<p>If mi seh, dat inna any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraw fram di air a certain element, weh being subsequently bring into contact wid di blood imparts to di blood its vivifying principle, mi no tink mi shall err; though mi may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, an it follow seh if all di blood inna a man coulda be aerated wid one breath, him might den seal up him nostrils an not fetch anodda fi a considerable time. Dat mean, him woulda den live widout breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, dis is precisely di case wid di whale, who systematically live, by intervals, him full hour an more (wen at di bottom) widout drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; fi, memba, him nuh have no gills. How dis is? Between him ribs an pan each side a him spine him get supply wid a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth a vermicelli-like vessels, weh vessels, wen him quit di surface, dem completely distended wid oxygenated blood. So dat fi an hour or more, a thousand fathoms inna di sea, him carry a surplus stock a vitality inna him, jus like how di camel weh a cross di waterless desert carry a surplus supply a drink fi future use inna him four supplementary stomachs. Di anatomical fact a dis labyrinth is indisputable; an dat di supposition weh dem found pan it is reasonable an true, seems di more cogent to mi, wen mi consider di otherwise inexplicable obstinacy a dat deh leviathan inna <i>having him spoutings out</i> , as di fishermen phrase it. Dis a weh mi mean. If unmolested, upon rising to di surface, di Sperm Whale will continue deh fi a period a time exactly uniform wid all him other unmolested risings. Seh him stay eleven minutes, an jet seventy times, dat mean, respire seventy breaths; den whenever him rise again, him wi be sure fi have him seventy breaths ova again, to a minute. Now, if afta him fetch a few breaths yuh alarm him, so dat him sound, him will always be dodge up again fi mek good him regular allowance a air. An not til dem seventy breaths deh tell, him ago finally go dung fi stay out him full term below. Remark, however, dat in different individuals dem rates deh different; but inna any one dem a di same. Now, why di whale fi insist fi have him spoutings out, unless it be fi replenish him reservoir a air, ere descending fi good? How obvious is it, too, dat dis necessity fi di whale's rising expose him to all di fatal hazards a di chase. For not by hook or by net coulda ketch dis big leviathan, wen him did a sail a thousand fathoms unda di sunlight. Not so much yuh skill, den, O hunter, as di great necessities weh strike di victory to thee!</p>
<p>Inna man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serve fi two or three pulsations; so dat whatever ada business him haffi attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe him haffi, or die him will. But di Sperm Whale only breath bout one seventh or Sunday a him time.</p>
<p>Dem seh dat di whale only breath thru him spout-hole; if it coulda truthfully be added dat him spouts dem mixed wid water, den mi opinion wi shuda be furnished wid di reason why him sense a smell seems obliterated inna him; fi di ongl ting bout him weh at all ansa tu him nose a dat deh identical spout-hole; an being so clogged wid two elements, it couldn't be expected fi have di power a smell. But owing to di mystery a di spout—weda it be water or weda it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at pan dis head. Sure it is, nevertheless, dat di Sperm Whale have no proper olfactories. Bot wa im waahn dem fi du? No roses, no violets, no Cologne-water inna di sea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as him windpipe solely open inna di tube a him spouting canal, an as dat deh long canal—like di grand Erie Canal—is furnished wid a sort a locks (dat open an shut) fi di downward retention a air or di upward exclusion a water, therefore di whale have no voice; unless yuh insult him by saying, dat wen him so strangely rumbles, him talk through him nose. But den again, weh di whale have fi seh? Seldom mi know any profound being weh did have anyting fi seh to dis world, unless mi did a force fi stammer out someting by way a get a living. Awo! happy seh di worl a such an excellent listener!</p>
<p>Now, di spouting canal a di Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is fi di conveyance a air, an fi several feet laid along, horizontally, jus beath di upper surface a him head, an a likkle to one side; dis curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe weh dem put dung inna a city pan one side a one street. But di kweschan return weda dis gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; inna ada wod, weda di spout a di Sperm Whale a di mere vapor a di exhaled breath, or weda dat deh exhaled breath mix wid waata weh tek iin a di mout, an discharge chuu di spiracle. It certain seh di mout indirectly communicate wid di spouting canal; but it cyaan prove seh dis a fi di purpose a discharge water thru di spiracle. Bikaaz di greatest necessity fi so doing woulda seem to be, wen inna feeding him accidentally tek in water. But di Sperm Whale's food deh far unda di surface, an deh him cyaan spout even if him woulda. Besides, if yuh regard him very closely, an time him wid yuh watch, yuh wi find out seh wen him unmolested, deh have an undeviating rhyme between di periods a him jets an di ordinary periods a respiration.</p>
<p>But why pester one wid all dis reasoning pan di subject? Speak out! Yuh si him a spout; den declare weh di spout is; yuh cyaan tell water fram air? Mi dear sa, inna dis ya worl it no so easy fi settle dem ya plain tings. Mi eva find yuh plain tings di knottiest a all. An as fi dis whale spout, yuh might almost stan inna it, an yet be undecided as to weh it is precisely.</p>
<p>Di central body a it hide inna di snowy sparkling mist weh envelope it; an how yuh can certainly tell weda any water fall fram it, wen, always, wen yuh deh close enough to a whale fi get a close view a him spout, him deh inna a prodigious commotion, di water cascading all roun him. An if at such times yuh shuda tink seh yuh really perceive drops a moisture inna di spout, how yuh fi know seh dem nuh merely condensed fram it vapor; or how yuh know seh dem a nuh dem identical drops deh weh superficially lodge inna di spout-hole fissure, weh countersunk inna di summit a di whale's head? For even wen him did a swim chruu di mid-day sea inna a calm, wid him elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's inna di desert; even den, di whale always carry a likkle basin a water pan him head, as unda a blazing sun yuh will sometimes see a cavity inna a rock full up wid rain.</p>
<p>Nor it is at all prudent fi di hunter fi be ova curious touching di precise nature a di whale spout. It naa go do fi him fi be peering inna it, an putting him face inna it. Yuh cyaan go wid yuh pitcher to dis fountain an full it, an bring it weh. Fi even wen yuh come inna slight contact wid di outer, vapory shreds a di jet, weh wi often happen, yuh skin wi feverishly smart, fram di acridness a di ting so touching it. An mi know one, weh come inna still closer contact wid di spout, weda wid some scientific object in view, or otherwise, mi cyan seh, di skin peel off fram him cheek an arm. So, mongst whalemen, di spout is considered poisonous; dem try fi evade it. Wan neks ting; Mi hear it seh, an mi no much doubt it, seh if di jet fairly spout inna yuh eyes, it ago blind yuh. Di wisest ting di investigator can do den, it look like mi, is fi mek dis deadly spout alone.</p>
<p>Stil, wi can hypothesize, even if wi cyaan prove an establish. Mi hypothesis is dis: dat di spout a notn but mist. An besides ada reasons, to dis conclusion mi get impelled, by considerations touching di great inherent dignity an sublimity a di Sperm Whale; Mi consider him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact dat him neva find pan soundings, or near shores; all ada whales sometimes are. Im a both ponderous an profound. An mi convinced seh fram di head a all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, di Devil, Jupiter, Dante, an so on, deh always go up a certain semi-visible steam, while inna di act a tink deep thoughts. While mi did a compose a likkle treatise pan Eternity, mi did have di curiosity fi put a mirror before mi; an ere long saw reflected deh, a curious involve worming an undulation inna di atmosphere ova mi head. Di invariable moisture a mi hair, while plunged inna deep thought, afta six cups a hot tea inna mi thin shingled attic, a one August noon; dis look like an additional argument fi di above supposition.</p>
<p>An how nobly it raise wi conceit a di mighty, misty monster, fi behold him solemnly sailing thru a calm tropical sea; him vast, mild head uovahung by a canopy a vapor, engendered by him incommunicable contemplations, an dat vapor—as yuh wi sometimes see it—glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself did put its seal pan him thoughts. For, d'ye see, rainbows nuh visit di clear air; dem only irradiate vapor. An so, chruu all di thick mists a di dim doubts inna mi mind, divine intuitions now an den shoot, enkindling mi fog wid a heavenly ray. An fi dis mi tank Gad; fi all have doubts; nuff a dem deny; but doubts or denials, few along wid dem, have intuitions. Doubts a all tings earthly, an intuitions a some tings heavenly; dis combination mek neither believer nor infidel, but mek a man weh regard dem both wid equal eye.</p>
