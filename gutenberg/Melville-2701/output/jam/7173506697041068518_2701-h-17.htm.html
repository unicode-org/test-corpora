<h2 id="pgepubid00091">CHAPTER 86. Di Tail.</h2>
<p>Ada poets dem warbled di praises a di soft eye a di antilope, an di lovely plumage a di bird weh neva alight; less celestial, mi celebrate a tail.</p>
<p>Reckoning di largest sized Sperm Whale's tail fi staat at dat deh point a di trunk weh it tapers to bout di girth a one man, it comprise upon it upper surface alone, an area a at least fifty square feet. Di compact round body a it root expand inna two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling weh to less dan an inch inna thickness. At di crotch or junction, dem flukes yah slightly overlap, den sideways recede fram each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. Inna no living ting di lines a beauty more exquisitely defined dan inna di crescent borders a dem flukes yah. At its utmost expansion inna di full grown whale, di tail ago considerably exceed twenty feet across.</p>
<p>Di entire member look like a dense webbed bed a welded sinews; but cut inna it, an yuh find seh three distinct strata compose it:—upper, middle, an lower. Di fibers dem inna di upper an lower layers, dem long an horizontal; dem a di middle one, very short, an running crosswise between di outside layers. Dis triune structure, as much as anyting else, imparts power to di tail. Tu di student a old Roman walls, di middle layer ago furnish a curious parallel to di thin course a tiles weh always alternate wid di stone inna dem wonderful relics a di antique, an weh undoubtedly contribute so much to di great strength a di masonry.</p>
<p>But as if dis vast local power inna di tendinous tail neva enough, di whole bulk a di leviathan is knit ova wid a warp an woof a muscular fibers an filaments, weh pass pan either side di loins an running dung inna di flukes, insensibly blend wid dem, an largely contribute to dem might; so dat inna di tail di confluent measureless force a di whole whale seem concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to matter, dis was di ting fi do it.</p>
<p>Nor does dis—its amazing strength, at all tend fi cripple di graceful flexion a it motions; weh infantileness a ease undulates chruu a Titanism a power. Pan di contrary, dem motions derive dem most appalling beauty fram it. Real strength neva impair beauty or harmony, but it often bestow it; an inna everyting imposingly beautiful, strength have much fi duh wid di magic. Tek weh di tied tendons dem weh all ova seem a burst fram di marble inna di carved Hercules, an it charm woulda be gone. As devout Eckerman lift di linen sheet fram di naked corpse a Goethe, him did overwhelmed wid di massive chest a di man, weh did look like a Roman triumphal arch. Wen Angelo paint even God di Fada inna human form, mark weh robustness deh deh. An whatever dem may reveal a di divine love inna di Son, di soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which him idea have been most successfully embodied; demya pikcha ya, so destitute az dem a aal brawniness, hint notn a no powa, bot di mere negitiv, feminine wan a sobmishan an endurance, we pan aal han it kansida, faam di peculiar praktikal virtues a im tiichin dem.</p>
<p>Such is di subtle elasticity a di organ weh mi a treat a, dat weda wielded inna sport, or inna earnest, or inna anger, whatever be di mood it be inna, its flexions dem invariably marked by exceeding grace. No fairy's arm can transscend it.</p>
<p>Five great motions are peculiar to it. Fos, wen yuh use as a fin fi progression; Sekant, wen yuh use as a mace inna battle; Third, inna sweeping; Fourth, inna lobtailing; Fifth, inna peaking flukes.</p>
<p>Fos: Being horizontal inna it position, di Leviathan's tail act inna a different manner fram di tails a all di ada sea creatures. It neva wriggle. Inna man or fish, wriggling a one sign a inferiority. Fi di whale, him tail a di sole means fi propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled forwards beath di body, an den rapidly sprung backwards, a dis weh gi dat singular darting, leaping motion to di monster wen furiously swimming. Him side-fins only serve fi steer by.</p>
<p>Sekant: It a likl signifikant, se wail wan sperm whale onggl fait wan neda sperm whale wid im ed an jaw, neba, ina im kanflik wid man, im chiefly an contemptuously yuuz im tail. Wen him strike at a boat, him swiftly curve weh him flukes fram it, an di blow is only inflicted by di recoil. If it be mek inna di unobstructed air, especially if it descend to it mark, di stroke is den simply irresistible. No ribs a man or boat cyaan stan it. Yuh only salvation is inna eluding it; but if it come sideways thru di opposing water, den partly owing to di light buoyancy a di whale-boat, an di elasticity a it materials, a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort a stitch inna di side, is generally di most serious result. Dem submerged side blows yah so often get inna di fishery, dat dem a accounted mere child's play. Sombadi strip off a frock, an di hole stop.</p>
<p>Third: Mi cyan demonstrate it, but it seems to mi, dat inna di whale di sense a touch is concentrated inna di tail; fi inna dis respect deh deh a delicacy inna it weh only equaled by di daintiness a di elephant's trunk. Dis delicacy is chiefly evinced inna di action a sweeping, wen inna maidenly gentleness di whale wid a certain soft slowness move him immense flukes fram side to side pan di surface a di sea; an if him feel only a sailor's whisker, woe to dat deh sailor, whiskers an all. Wat tenderness deh inna dat deh preliminary touch! If dis tail did have any prehensile power, mi shuda straightway bethink mi bout Darmonodes' elephant weh so frequented di flower-market, an wid low salutations present nosegays to damsels, an den caress dem zones. Pan more accounts dan one, a pity it is dat di whale nuh have dis prehensile virtue inna him tail; kaa mi ier bout yet wan neda elifant, we wen im get shat ina di fait, im go roun im chrunk an tek out di dart.</p>
<p>Fourth: Stealing unawares upon di whale inna di fancied security a di middle a solitary seas, yuh find him unbent fram di vast corpulence a him dignity, an kitten-like, him play pan di ocean as if it was a hearth. But still yuh see him power inna him play. Di broad palms a him tail dem flirt high inna di air; den smiting di surface, di thunderous concussion resound fi miles. Yuh woulda almost tink seh a great gun did get discharge; an if yuh notice di light wreath a vapor fram di spiracle at him ada extremity, yuh woulda tink seh dat was di smoke fram di touch-hole.</p>
<p>Fifth: As inna di ordinary floating posture a di leviathan di flukes dem lie considerably below di level a him back, dem den completely out a sight unda di surface; but wen him bout fi plunge inna di deeps, him entire flukes wid at least thirty feet a him body get toss erect inna di air, an so remain vibrating a moment, til dem downwards shoot out a view. Excepting di sublime <i>breach</i> —somwe else fi be described—dis peaking a di whale's flukes is perhaps di grandest sight fi be seen inna all animated nature. Outa di bottomless profundities di gigantic tail look spasmodically snatching at di highest heaven. So inna dreams, mi si majestic Satan a thrust out him tormented colossal claw fram di flame Baltic a Hell. But inna gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood yuh deh inna; if inna di Dantean, di devils dem ago occur to yuh; if inna dat a Isaiah, di archangels. Stan op a di mast-head a mi ship during a sunrise weh did a crimson sky an sea, mi once si a big herd a whales inna di east, all a dem a head towards di sun, an fi a moment a vibrate inna concert wid peaked flukes. As it did look to mi at di time, such a grand embodiment a adoration a di gods neva did deh, even inna Persia, di home a di fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testify bout di African elephant, mi den testify bout di whale, pronouncing him di most devout a all beings. For according to King Juba, di military elephants of antiquity often hailed di morning wid dem trunks uplifted inna di profoundest silence.</p>
<p>Di chance comparison inna dis chapter, between di whale an di elephant, so far as some aspects a di tail a di one an di trunk a di ada one concern, shudn't tend fi place dem two opposite organs deh pan an equality, much less di creatures dem weh dem respectively belong to. For as di mightiest elephant is jus a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared wid Leviathan's tail, him trunk is jus di stalk a one lily. Di most direful blow fram di elephant's trunk was as di playful tap a one fan, compared wid di measureless crush an crash a di sperm whale's ponderous flukes, weh inna repeated instances have one afta di ada hurled entire boats wid all dem oars an crews inna di air, very much as an Indian juggler toss him balls*ses.</p>
<p>*Though all comparison inna di way a general bulk between di whale an di elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in dat particular di elephant stan inna much di same respect to di whale weh a dog do to di elephant; nevertheless, deh nuh waan some points a curious similitude; mongx dem deh is di spout. It is well known dat di elephant will often draw up water or dust inna him trunk, an den elevate it, jet it forth inna a stream.</p>
<p>Di more mi consider dis mighty tail, di more mi deplore mi inability fi express it. Somtaim deh have gestures inna it, weh, though dem woulda well grace di hand a man, remain wholly inexplicable. Inna wan extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, dem mystic gestures deh, dat mi hear hunters weh did declare dem akin to Free-Mason signs an symbols; dat di whale, indeed, by dem methods intelligently conversed wid di world. No ada moshan a di whale inna him general body, full a strangeness, an unaccountable to him most experienced assailant. Dissect him how mi may, den, mi but go skin deep; Mi no know him, an mi neva know him. But if mi nuh know even di tail a dis whale, how mi andastan him head? much more, how comprehend him face, wen face him have none? Yuh ago si mi back parts, mi tail, him seem fi seh, but mi face naa go see. But mi cyan completely mek out him back parts; an hint weh him waan bout him face, mi seh again him nuh have no face.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00092">CHAPTER 87. Di Grand Armada.</h2>
<p>Di lang ah naro peninsiula a Malaka, we exten sout-iis frah di terichridem a Birmah, faam di muos soutiis paint a aal Ieja. Inna a continuous line fram dat deh peninsula stretch di long islands a Sumatra, Java, Bally, an Timor; weh, wid plenty ada wan dem, form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia wid Australia, an dividing di long unbroken Indian ocean fram di thickly studded oriental archipelagoes. Dis rampart is pierced by several sally-ports fi di convenience a ships an whales; conspicuous mongst which is di straits a Sunda an Malacca. By di straits a Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China fram di west, emerge inna di China seas.</p>
<p>Dem deh narrow straits a Sunda divide Sumatra fram Java; an standing midway inna dat deh vast rampart a islands, buttressed by dat deh bold green promontory, weh di seamen dem call Java Head; dem not a likkle correspond to di central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: an considering di inexhaustible wealth a spices, an silks, an jewels, an gold, an ivory, wid which di thousand islands a dat deh oriental sea enriched, it look like a significant provision a nature, dat such treasures, by di very formation a lan, shuda be at least appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western world. Di shores a di Straits a Sunda no have dem domineering fortresses weh guard di entrance dem to di Mediterranean, di Baltic, an di Propontis. Unlike di Danes, dem Orientals yah no demand di obsequious homage a lowered top-sails fram di endless procession a ships before di wind, weh fi centuries past, by night an by day, did a pass between di islands a Sumatra an Java, freighted wid di costliest cargoes a di east. But while dem freely waive a ceremonial like dis, dem do by no means renounce dem claim to more solid tribute.</p>
<p>Time out a mind di piratical proas a di Malay dem, weh did a lurk mongx di low shaded coves an islets a Sumatra, don sallied out pan di vessels dem weh did a sail chuu di straits, fiercely demanding tribute at di point a dem spears. Though by di repeated bloody chastisements dem weh dem get fram di han a European cruisers, di audacity a dem corsairs yah a late get repressed; yet, even at di present day, wi occasionally hear bout English an American vessels, weh, inna dem deh water deh, get remorselessly boarded an pillage.</p>
<p>Wid a fair, fresh wind, di Pequod did a draw nigh to dem straits yah; Ahab did a purpose fi pass thru dem inna di Javan sea, an den, cruising northwards, ova waters weh di Sperm Whale did a frequent yah an deh, sweep inshore by di Philippine Islands, an gain di far coast a Japan, inna time fi di great whaling season deh. By dem means yah, di circumnavigating Pequod woulda sweep almost all di known Sperm Whale cruising grounds a di worl, before dem did a go dong pan di Line inna di Pacific; weh Ahab, though everyweh else foiled inna him pursuit, firmly count upon giving battle to Moby Dick, inna di sea weh him did most known fi frequent; an at a season wen him might most reasonably be presumed fi be haunting it.</p>
<p>But how now? inna dis zoned quest, do Ahab touch no lan? him crew drink air? Surely, him ago stop fi water. No. Fi a long time, now, di circus-running sun a race widin him fiery ring, an need no sustenance but weh deh inna himself. So Ahab. Mark dis, too, inna di whaler. While ada hulls dem load dung wid alien stuff, fi be transferred to foreign wharves; di world-wandering whale-ship carry no cargo but harself an crew, dem weapons an dem wants. Shi have a whole lake's contents bottled inna har ample hold. She is ballasted wid utilities; not altogether wid unusable pig-lead an kentledge. Shi carry years' water inna har. Clear old prime Nantucket water; weh, wen three years afloat, di Nantucketer, inna di Pacific, prefer fi drink before di brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off inna casks, fram di Peruvian or Indian streams. So it is, dat, while ada ships may have gone to China fram New York, an back again, touching at a score of ports, di whale-ship, in all dat interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; har crew neva si no man but floating seamen like demself. So dat did yuh carry dem di news seh anodda flood did come; dem wuda onggl ansa—“Wel, bwai, si di aak!”</p>
<p>Now, as many Sperm Whales did get capture off di western coast a Java, inna di near vicinity a di Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most a di ground, roundabout, was generally recognized by di fishermen as an excellent spot fi cruising; so, as di Pequod get more an more pan Java Head, di look-outs dem did a repeatedly hail, an admonished fi keep wide awake. But though di green palmy cliffs a di lan soon loomed pan di starboard bow, an wid delighted nostrils di fresh cinnamon did a snuff inna di air, yet not a single jet was described. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in wid any game hereabouts, di ship did well nigh enter di straits, wen di customary cheering cry did hear fram aloft, an ere long a spectacle a singular magnificence saluted wi.</p>
<p>But yahso be it premised, dat owing to di unwearied activity wid which of late dem did a hunt ova all four oceans, di Sperm Whales, instead a almost invariably sailing inna small detached companies, as inna former times, dem now frequently meet wid inna extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, dat it woulda almost seem as if dem did have numerous sworn nations league an covenant fi mutual assistance an protection. Tu dis aggregation a di Sperm Whale inna such immense caravans, may be imputed di circumstance dat even inna di bes cruising grounds, yuh may now sometimes sail fi weeks an months tugeda, widout being greeted by a single spout; an den be suddenly saluted by weh sometimes seems thousands on thousands.</p>
<p>Broad pan both bows, at di distance a some two or three miles, an forming a great semicircle, embracing one half a di level horizon, a continuous chain a whale-jets did a up-play an sparkling inna di noon-day air. Unlike di straight perpendicular twin-jets a di Right Whale, weh, dividing at top, fall ova inna two branch, like di cleft drooping boughs a one willow, di single forward-slanting spout a di Sperm Whale present a thick curled bush a white mist, continually rising an falling a leeway to leeward.</p>
<p>Wen yuh si fram di Pequod's deck, den, as she woulda rise pan a high hill a di sea, dis host a vapory spouts, individually curling up inna di air, an beheld thru a blending atmosphere a bluish haze, did a show like di thousand cheerful chimneys a some dense metropolis, weh dem did a describe a one balmy autumn morning, pan a heightman.</p>
<p>As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile inna di mountains, accelerate dem march, all eagerness fi place dat perilous passage inna dem rear, an once more expand inna comparative security upon di plain; even so did dis vast fleet a whales now did a hurry forward thru di straits; gradually contracting di wings a dem semicircle, an swim on, inna one solid, but still crescent centre.</p>
<p>Crowding all sail di Pequod pressed afta dem; di harpooneers dem a handle dem weapons, an loudly a cheer fram di head a dem yet suspended boats. If di wind only did a hold, likkle doubt had dem, dat did a chas chruu dem Straits of Sunda, di vast host woulda only deploy inna di Oriental seas fi witness di capture a not a few a dem numba. An who coulda tell weda, inna dat deh congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like di worshiped white-elephant inna di coronation procession a di Siamese! So wid stun-sail pailed pan stun-sail, wi sail along, driving dem leviathans deh before wi; wen, a sudden, di voice a Tashtego did hear, loudly directing attention to someting inna wi wake.</p>
<p>Corresponding to di crescent inna wi van, we beheld anodda one inna wi rear. It did look like it did form a detached white vapors, rising an falling someting like di spouts a di whales; only dem neva so completely come an go; fi dem did a hover constantly, widout finally disappear. Leveling him glass at dis sight, Ahab quickly revolve inna him pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft deh, an rig whips an buckets fi wet di sails;—Malays, sir, an afta wi!”</p>
<p>As if too long lurking behind di headlands, til di Pequod shuda fairly did enter di straits, dem rascally Asiatics deh did now inna hot pursuit, fi mek up fi dem over-cautious delay. But wen di swift Pequod, wid a fresh leading wind, did deh inna hot chase; how very kind a dem tawny philanthropists yah fi assist inna speeding har on to har own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips an rowels to har, dat dem did. As wid glass unda arm, Ahab to-an-fro paced di deck; inna him forward turn beholding di monsters dem weh him did a chase, an inna di afta one di bloodthirsty pirates dem did a chase <i>him</i> ; some such fancy as di above did look fi him. An wen him look pan di green walls a di watery defile weh di ship did a sail inna den, an him tink seh a di gate deh di way fi him vengeance, an him si, how through dat deh gate him did a chase an get chase to him deadly end; an not only dat, but a herd a remorseless wild pirates an inhuman atheistical devils did a cheer him on wid dem curses;—wen all dem conceits did pass thru him brain, Ahab's brow did lef gaunt an ribbed, like di black sand beach afta some stormy tide did a gnaw it, widout being firmable to drag from it place.</p>
<p>But tings like dem did a trouble very few a di reckless crew; an wen, afta steadily drop an drop di pirates astern, di Pequod at last shot by di vivid green Cockatoo Point pan di Sumatra side, emerging at last upon di broad waters beyond; den, di harpooneers dem did look more fi grieve seh di swift whales dem did a gain pan di ship, dan fi rejoice seh di ship did so victoriously gain pan di Malays. But still a drive on inna di wake a di whales, at length dem did a look like dem did a abate dem speed; gradually di ship did a near dem; an di wind did a ded weh now, word did pass fi spring to di boats dem. But no sooner did di herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct a di Sperm Whale, get notified a di three keels dem weh did deh afta dem,—though as yet a mile inna dem rear,—dan dem rally again, an form inna close ranks an battalions, so dat dem spouts all look like flashing lines a stacked bayonets, moved on red velocity.</p>
<p>Stripped to wi shirts an drawers, wi sprang to di white-ash, an afta several hours' pulling wi did almost dispose fi renounce di chase, wen a general pausing commotion mongst di whales gi dem animating token seh dem did deh now at last unda di influence a dat deh strange perplexity a inert irresolution, weh, wen di fish dem perceve it inna di heale, dem seh gallied. Di compact martial columns dem weh dem did a swim rapidly an steadily inna, did now brok op inna one measureless rout; an like King Porus's elephants inna di Indian battle wid Alexander, dem did a go mad wid consternation. Inna all directions expanding inna vast irregular circles, an aimlessly swimming hither an thither, by dem short thick spoutings, dem plainly betray dem distraction a panic. Dis was still more strangely evinced by dem a dem numba, who, completely paralyzed as it were, helplessly float like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea. If dem Leviathans deh was only a flock a simple sheep, pursued ova di pasture by three fierce wolves, dem couldn't possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But dis occasional timidity is characteristic a almost all herding creatures. Though banding tugeda inna tens a thousands, di lion-maned buffaloes a di West don fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how wen dem herd tugeda inna di sheepfold a one theatre's pit, dem wi, at di slightest alarm a fire, rush helter-skelter fi di outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, an remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at di strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of man.</p>
<p>Though plenty a di whales, as dem seh, did inna violent motion, yet it is fi be observed dat as a whole di herd neither advanced nor retreated, but collectively remained inna one place. As is customary inna dem case deh, di boats dem separate at once, each mek fi some one lone whale pan di outskirts a di shoal. Inna bout three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon did fling; di stricken fish dart blinding spray inna wi faces, an den run weh wid wi like light, steer straight fi di heart a di herd. Though such a movement pan di part a di whale strike unda such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; an indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet it present one a di more perilous vicissitudes a di fishery. For as di swift monster drag yuh deeper an deeper inna di frantic shoal, yuh bid adieu to circumspect life an only exist inna a delirious throb.</p>
<p>As, blind an deaf, di whale plonge forward, as if by sheer power a speed fi rid himself a di iron leech weh did fasten to him; as we thus tore a white gash inna di sea, pan all sides menaced as wi fly, by di crazed creatures to an fro rush roun wi; wi beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles inna a tempest, an striving fi steer thru dem complicated channels an straits, knowing not at what moment it may be locked in an crushed.</p>
<p>But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steer wi manfully; now sheering off fram dis monster directly across wi route in advance; now edging away fram dat, whose colossal flukes did suspended ovahead, while all di time, Starbuck did a stan up inna di bows, lance inna him han, a prick out a wi way whatever whales him coulda reach by short darts, fi deh neva have no time fi mek long ones. Nor di oarsmen dem did quite idle, though dem wonted duty did now altogether dispensed wid. Dem chiefly attend to di shouting part a di business. “Out a di way, Commodore!” cried one, to a great dromedary weh a sudden rise bodyly to di surface, an fi a instant threaten fi swamp wi. “Hard dung wid yuh tail, deh!” cried a second to anodda, weh, close to wi gunwale, did a look calmly cool himself wid him own fan-like extremity.</p>
<p>All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares a wood a equal size dem stoutly clenched tugeda, so dat dem cross each other's grain at right angles; a line a considerable length is den attached to di middle a dis block, an di ada end a di line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. A chiefly mongst gallied whales weh dem use dis drugg. Fi den, more whales deh close roun yuh dan yuh can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales dem nuh every day encounter; wail yuh can, den, yuh haffi kill all yuh can. An if yuh cyaan kill dem all at once, yuh haffi wing dem, so dem can be kill aftawards at yuh leasure. So it is, dat at times like dem ya di drugg, come inna requisition. Wi boat did furnish wid three a dem. Di fos an di sekan wan dem did successfully darted, an wi si di whales dem a run off staggeringly, fettered by di enormous sidelong resistance a di towing drugg. Dem did cramp like malefactors wid di chain an ball. But wen yuh fling di third, inna di act a tossing ovaboard di clumsy wooden block, it ketch unda one a di seats a di boat, an inna a instant tore it out an carry it weh, drop di oarsman inna di boat's bottom as di seat slid fram unda him. Pan both sides di sea come in at di wounded planks, but we stuff two or three drawers an shirts in, an so stop di leaks fi di time.</p>
<p>It did deh next to impossible fi dart dem drugged-harpoons yah, if it neva seh as we did a advance inna di herd, wi whale's way greatly diminished; moreover, dat as we did a goh still further an further fram di circumference a commotion, di direful disorders dem did a look like dem did a waan. So dat wen di jerking harpoon draw out, an di towing whale sideways vanish; den, wid di tapering force a him parting momentum, wi glide between two whales inna di innermost heart a di shoal, as if fram some mountain torrent wi did slid inna a serene valley lake. Yahso di storms inna di roaring glens between di outermost whales, did hear but dem neva feel. Inna dis central expanse di sea did present dat deh smooth satin-like surface, weh dem call a sleek, weh did produce by di subtle moisture weh di whale did a throw off inna him more quiet moods. Yes, wi did deh inna dat deh enchanted calm weh dem seh lurks at di heart a every commotion. An still inna di distracted distance we beheld di tumults a di outer concentric circles, an si successive pods a whales, eight or ten inna each, swiftly a go round an round, like multiplied spans a horses inna a ring; an so closely shoulder to shoulder, dat a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched di middle ones, an so have gone round pan dem backs. Owing to di density a di crowd a reposing whales, more immediately surrounding di embayed axis a di herd, no possible chance fi escape was at present afforded wi. Wi haffi watch fi a breach inna di living wall weh did a hemmed wi inna; di wall weh did only admit wi fi shut wi up. Keeping at di center a di lake, wi did get visit by small tame cows an calves occasionally; di women an pickney dem a dis routed host.</p>
<p>Now, inclusive a di occasional wide intervals between di revolving outer circles, an inclusive a di spaces between di various pods inna any one a dem circles deh, di entire area at dis juncture, embraced by di whole multitude, mus have contained at least two or three square miles. At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from wi low boat weh did look like a play up almost fram di rim a di horizon. Mi mention dis circumstance, because, as if di cows an calves dem did purposely lock up inna dis innermost fold; an as if di wide extent a di herd did hitherto prevent dem fram laan di precise cause a it stop; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, an every way innocent an inexperienced; however it may been been, dem smaller whales—now an den visiting wi becalmed boat fram di margin a di lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness an confidence, or else a still becharmed panic weh it was impossible not fi marvel at. Like household dog dem come snuffling roun wi, right up to wi gunwales, an touch dem; til it almost did look like some spell did suddenly domesticate dem. Queequeg pat dem foreheads; Starbuck scratch dem back wid him lance; but fearful a di consequences, fi di time refrain fram darting it.</p>
<p>But far beath dis wonderous world pan di surface, anodda an still stranger world meet wi eyes as wi gaze ova di side. For, suspended inna dem deh watery vaults, float di forms a di nursing mothers a di whales, an dem weh by dem enormous girth did look like dem did a become mothers. Di lake, as mi did hint, was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent; an as human infants while suckling will calmly an fixedly gaze weh fram di breast, as if dem a lead two different life at di time; an while yet a draw mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so did di young a dem whales yah did a look up towards wi, but not at wi, as if wi was but a bit a Gulfweed inna dem new-born sight. Floating pan dem sides, di mada dem did a look quietly a look pan wi. One a dem likkle infant deh, weh fram certain queer tokens did look hardly a day old, mighta did measure some fourteen feet inna length, an some six feet inna girth. Im did a likkle frisky; though as yet him body did look scarce yet recovered fram dat deh irksome position weh it did so lately occupied inna di maternal reticule; weh, tail to head, an all ready fi di final spring, di unborn whale lie bent like a Tartar's bow. Di delicate side-fins, an di palms a him flukes, still freshly retained di plaited crumpled appearance a one baby's ears weh did newly arrive fram foreign parts.</p>
<p>“Line! line!” Queequeg baal out, a look ova di gunwale; “im fast! him fast!—Who line him! Who strike?—Two whale; one big, one likkle!”</p>
<p>“Weh ail yuh, man?” Starbuck baal out.</p>
<p>“Look-e yah,” seh Queequeg, pointing dung.</p>
<p>As wen di stricken whale, dat fram di tub did reel out hundreds a fathoms a rope; as, afta deep sounding, him float up again, an show di slackened curling line buoyantly rising an spiraling towards di air; so now, Starbuck si long coils a di umbilical cord a Madame Leviathan, by which di young cub did look like it did still tether to it dam. Not seldom inna di rapid vicissitudes a di chase, dis natural line, wid di maternal end loose, become entangled wid di hempen one, so dat di cub is thereby trap. Som a di subtlest secrets a di seas did look like dem did a tell wi inna dis enchanted pond. Wi did si young Leviathan amours inna di deep.*</p>
<p>*Di sperm whale, as wid all ada species a di Leviathan, but unlike most ada fish, breed indifferently at all seasons; afta a gestation weh may probably be set dung at nine months, producing but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but di breasts demself extend upwards fram dat. Wen by chance dem precious parts inna a nursing whale get cut by di hunter's lance, di mada's pouring milk an blood rivallingly discolour di sea fi rods. Di milk very sweet an rich; it don taste by man; it might do well wid strawberries. Wen dem overflow wid mutual esteem, di whales dem salute <i>more hominum</i> .</p>
<p>An so, though surrounded by circle upon circle a consternations an affrights, did dem inscrutable creatures deh at di center freely an fearlessly indulge inna all peaceful concerns; yea, serenely reveled inna dalliance an delight. But even so, amid di tornadoed Atlantic a mi being, do miself still fi ever centrally disport inna mute calm; an while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round mi, deep dung an deep inland deh mi still bathe mi inna eternal mildness a joy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, di occasional sudden frantic spectacles inna di distance evinced di activity a di ada boats dem, still engaged inna drugging di whales dem pan di frontier a di host; or possibly carrying on di war widin di first circle, weh abundance a room an some convenient retreats did aford dem. But di sight a di enraged drugged whales dem now an den blindly darting to an fro across di circles, was nutten to weh at last meet wi eyes. It is sometimes di custom wen fast to a whale more dan commonly powerful an alert, fi seek fi hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming him gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope fi hauling it back again. A whale weh get wound (as we did laan aftawards) inna dis part, but not effectually, as it did look like, did break weh fram di boat, an did a carry wid him half a di harpoon line; an inna di extraordinary agony a di wound, him did a dash now mongst di revolving circles dem like di lone mounted desperado Arnold, at di battle a Saratoga, a carry dismay weh him go.</p>
<p>But agonizing as was di wound a dis whale, an an appalling spectacle enough, any way; yet di peculiar horror wid weh him did a inspire di res a di herd, was owing to a cause weh at first di intervening distance obscure fram wi. But at length we perceived seh by one a di unimaginable accidents a di fishery, dis whale did get entangled inna di harpoon-line weh him did a tow; him did run weh wid di cutting-spade inna him; an while di free end a di rope weh did attached to dat deh weapon, did permanently ketch inna di coils a di harpoon-line roun him tail, di cutting-spade itself did work loose fram him flesh. So dat tormented to madness, him did a churn chuu di wata, violently flailing wid him flexible tail, an tossing di keen spade bout him, wounding an murder him own comrades.</p>
<p>Dis terrific object did look like it did a memba di whole herd fram dem stationary fright. Fos, di whales dem weh did a form di margin a wi lake staat crowd likkle, an tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows fram far; den di lake itself staat faintly heave an swell; di submarine bridal-chambers an nurseries vanish; inna more an more contracting orbits di whales inna di more central circles staat swim inna thickening clusters. Yes, di long calm did a lef. A low advancing hum did soon heard; an den like to di tumultuous masses a block-ice wen di great river Hudson break up inna Spring, di entire host a whales come tumbling upon dem inner centre, as if fi pile demself up inna one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck an Queequeg change places; Starbuck tek di stern.</p>
<p>“Oars! Oars!” him intensely whispered, sezing di helm—“gripe yuh oars, an clutch yuh souls, now! Mi God, man, stan by! Shove him off, yuh Queequeg—di whale deh!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up, an stay so! Spring, man—pull, man; neva mind dem backs—scrape dem—scrapeway!”</p>
<p>Di boat did now all but jam between two vast black bulks, lef a narrow Dardanelles between dem long lengths. But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; den give way rapidly, an at di same time earnestly watching fi anodda outlet. Afta plenty similar hair-breadth escapes, wi at last swiftly glide inna weh did jus been one a di outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently making fi one centre. Dis lucky salvation did cheaply purchase by di loss a Queequeg's hat, who, wile did a stan up inna di bows fi prick di fugitive whales, did have him hat tek clean fram him head by di air-eddy weh did mek by di sudden tossing a one pair a broad flukes close by.</p>
<p>Riotous an disordered as di universal commotion now was, it soon resolve itself into weh did look like a systematic movement; fi dem did clump tugeda at last inna one dense body, dem den renew dem onward flight wid augmented fleetness. Furda pursuit was useless; but di boats dem still did a linger inna dem wake fi pick up weh drugged whales might be drop astern, an likewise fi secure one weh Flask did kill an waifed. Di waif a one pennoned pole, two or three a dem weh every boat carry; an weh, wen additional game deh deh, dem insert upright inna di floating body a one dead whale, both fi mark it place pan di sea, an also as token a prior possession, if di boats a any ada ship draw near.</p>
<p>Di result a dis lowering was somewhat illustrative a dat sagacious saying inna di Fishery,—di more whales di less fish. Outa all di drugged whales dem only one did get capture. Di res a dem did a try fi escape fi di time, but only fi get tek, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft dan di Pequod.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00093">CHAPTER 88. Schools an Schoolmasters.</h2>
<p>Di previous chapter did gi account a one immense body or herd a Sperm Whales, an deh did also gi di probable cause weh did a induce dem vast aggregations deh.</p>
<p>Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each. Dem deh band deh call schools. Dem generally a two sorts; dem weh mek almost entirely a females, an dem weh muster none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as dem familiarly designated.</p>
<p>Inna cavalier attendance pan di school a females, yuh invariably see a male a full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces him gallantry by falling inna di rear an covering di flight a him ladies. In truth, dis gentleman a one luxurious Ottoman, swimming bout ova di watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all di solaces an endearments a di harem. Di contrast between dis Ottoman an him concubines dem striking; cause, while him always a di largest leviathanic proportions, di ladies, even at full growth, dem nuh more dan one-third a di bulk a one average-sized male. Dem comparatively delicate, indeed; Mi dare seh, not fi exceed half a dozen yards roun di waist. Nevertheless, it cyaan be denied, dat upon di whole dem hereditarily entitled to <i>en bon point</i> .</p>
<p>It very curious fi watch dis harem an it lord inna dem indolent ramblings. Like fashionables, dem deh fi eva pan di move inna leisurely search a variety. Yuh meet dem pan di Line in time fi di full flower a di Equatorial feeding season, afta yuh jus come back, perhaps, fram spen di summer inna di Northern seas, an so cheating summer a all unpleasant weariness an warmth. By di time dem don lounge up an dung di promenade a di Equator awhile, dem staat fi di Oriental waters in anticipation a di cool season deh, an so evade di ada excessive temperature a di year.</p>
<p>Wen serenely advancing pan one a dem journey yah, if any strange suspicious sights yuh see, mi lord whale keep a wary eye pan him interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming dat way, presume fi draw confidentially close to one a di ladies, wid what prodigious fury di Bashaw assails him, an chase him weh! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are fi be permitted fi invade di sanctity a domestic bliss; though do weh di Bashaw will, him cyaan keep di most notorious Lothario outa him bed; fi, alas! all fish bed in common. As shore, di ladies dem often cause di most terrible duels mongst dem rival admirers; jus so wid di whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, an all fi love. Dem fence wid dem long lower jaws, sometimes dem lock dem tugeda, an so striving fi di supremacy like elks weh warringly interweave dem antlers. Not a few a dem get capture wid di deep scars a dem encounters yah,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; an inna some instances, wrenched an dislocated mout.</p>
<p>But supposing di invader a domestic bliss fi betake himself weh at di first rush a di harem's lord, den is it very diverting fi watch dat deh lord. Gently him insinuate him vast bulk mongst dem again an revel deh awhile, still inna tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshiping among him thousand concubines. Granting ada whales fi deh inna sight, di fishermen dem wi seldom gi chase to one a dem Grand Turks yah; fi dem Grand Turks deh too lavish a dem strength, an hence dem unctuousness is small. As fi di son an di daughta dem weh dem beget, why, dem son an daughta deh haffi tek kier a demself; at least, wid only di maternal help. For like certain ada omnivorous roving lovers weh might be named, mi Lord Whale have no taste fi di nursery, however much fi di bower; an so, being a great traveller, him lef him anonymous babies all ova di world; every baby an exotic. Inna good time, nevertheless, as di ardor a youth decline; as years an dumps increase; as reflection lends har solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude overtake di sated Turk; den a love a ease an virtue supplants di love fi maidens; wi Ottoman enter pan di impotent, repentant, admonitory stage a life, forswears, disbands di harem, an grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, go bout all alone among di meridians an parallels saying him prayers, an warning each young Leviathan fram him amorous errors.</p>
<p>Now, as di harem a whales dem call by di fisherman dem a school, so is di lord an master a dat deh school technically known as di schoolmaster. It is therefore in strict character, however admirably satirical, dat afta him go a school himself, him shuda den go abroad inculcating not weh him laan deh, but di folly a it. Him title, schoolmaster, woulda very naturally seem derived fram di name bestowed upon di harem itself, but some have surmised dat di man weh first thus entitled dis sort a Ottoman whale, mus did read di memoirs a Vidocq, an informed himself weh sort a country-schoolmaster dat deh famous Frenchman was inna him younger days, an weh was di lessons of occulture him inculcate inna some a him pupils.</p>
<p>Di same secludedness an isolation weh di schoolmaster whale betakes himself to inna him advancing years, is true fi all aged Sperm Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is called—prove an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, him naa go have nobadi near him but Nature harself; an har him tek fi wife inna di wilderness a waters, an di bes a di wife dem she is, though she keep so much moody secrets.</p>
<p>Di school dem weh compose none but young an vigorous man dem, weh wi did mention before, offer a strong contrast to di harem school dem. For while dem deh female whales deh characteristically timid, di young males, or forty-barrel-bulls, as dem call dem, a by far di most pugnacious a all Leviathans, an proverbially di most dangerous fi encounter; except dem wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes meet, an dem deh ago fight yuh like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.</p>
<p>Di Forty-barrel-bull school dem bigga dan di harem school dem. Like a mob a young collegians, dem full a fight, fun, an wickedness, a tumbling round di worl at such a reckless, rollicking rate, dat no prudent underwriter woulda insure dem any more dan him woulda insure a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard. Dem soon relinquish dis turbulence though, an wen bout three-fourths grow, break up, an separately go bout inna quest a settlements, dat is, harems.</p>
<p>Wan neks point a difference between di male an female school dem is still more characteristic a di sexes. Seh yuh strike a Forty-barrel-bull—poor devil! all him comrades quit him. But strike a member a di harem school, an har companions swim roun har wid every token a concern, sometimes linger so near har an so long, as demself fi fall a prey.</p>
