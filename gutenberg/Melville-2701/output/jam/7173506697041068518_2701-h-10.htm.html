<h2 id="pgepubid00053">CHAPTER 48. Di Fos Lowering.</h2>
<p>Di phantoms, fi so dem did look, did a flitting pan di ada side a di deck, an, wid a noiseless celerity, did a cast loose di tackles an bands a di boat weh did a swing deh. Dis boat did always been deemed one a di spare boats, though technically call it di captain's, pan account a it did a hang fram di starboard quarter. Di figure weh did a stan up by it bows did tall an swart, wid one white tooth evily protruding fram it steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket a black cotton funereally invest him, wid wide black trowsers a di same dark stuff. But strangely crowning dis ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, di living hair braided an coiled round an round upon him head. Less swart in aspect, di companions a dis figure did a dat deh vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some a di aboriginal natives a di Manillas;—a race notorious fi a certain diabolism a subtilty, an by some honest white mariners suppose to be di paid spies an secret confidential agents pan di water devil, who dem did a count rose suppose fi deh elseweh.</p>
<p>While di wandering ship's company did a gaze pan dem strangers yah, Ahab baal out to di white-turban old man weh did deh inna dem head, “All ready deh, Fedallah?”</p>
<p>“Ready,” was di half-hissed reply.</p>
<p>“Lower away den; d'ye hear?” a shout across di deck. “Lower away deh, mi seh.”</p>
<p>Soch a di thunder a him voice, dat spite a dem amazement di man dem spring ova di rail; di sheaves dem did a whirl roun inna di blocks; wid a wallow, di three boat dem drop inna di sea; while, wid a dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, di sailors, goat-like, leap dung di rolling ship's side into di tossed boats below.</p>
<p>Hardly dem did pull out fram unda di ship's lee, wen a fourth keel, weh did a come fram di windward side, pull round unda di stern, an show di five strangers dem weh did a row Ahab, who, standing erect inna di stern, loudly hail Starbuck, Stubb, an Flask, fi spread demself wide, as to cover a large water. But wid all dem eyes again rivetted pan di swart Fedallah an him crew, di inmates dem a di ada boats dem neva obey di command.</p>
<p>“Captain Ahab?—” Starbuck seh.</p>
<p>“Spread unuself,” Ahab baal out; “give way, all four boats. Yuh, Flask, pull out more to leeward!”</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” cheerly cried likkle King-Post, sweeping roun him great steering oar. “Lay back!” a address him crew. “Deh!—deh!—deh agen! Deh shi blow rait ahed, bwai!—lie bak!”</p>
<p>“Neva heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, mi no mind dem, sir,” Archy seh; “Mi did know it all before now. Mi neva hear dem inna di hold? An mi neva tell Cabaco yah bout it? Weh yuh seh, Cabaco? Dem a stowaways, Mr. Flask.”</p>
<p>“Pull, pull, mi fine hearts-alive; pull, mi children; pull, mi likkle ones,” drawlingly an soothingly sigh Stubb to him crew, some a dem still did a show signs a uneasiness. “Why yuh nuh break yuh backbones, mi bwoys? Weh yuh stare at? Dem deh chaps deh inna yonder boat? Tut! Dem a only five more hands come fi help wi—never mind fram weh—di more di merrier. Pull, den, do pull; neva mind di brimstone—devils are good fellows enough. So, deh now; dat a di stroke fi swiip di stakes, mi heroes! saaf! Dat a it—dat a it! lang an chrang. Gi wie dat, gi wie! Di devl did a fetchtch unu, unu ragm fi rapskalal. Aal a unu a sliip. Stap snor, unu a sliip, an pul. Paal, unu naa go, den? pul, yu kyaahn, no chruu? pul, unu naa go du? Wa mek iina di bes fi govana an jiiza-kies no bada dis?—pall an . break someting pull, an staat yuh eyes out yah!” whipping out di sharp knife fram him girdle; “every mada son a unu draw him knife, an pull wid di blade between him teet. Dat a it—dat a it. Now unu do someting; dat look like it, mi steel-bits. Start har—start har, mi silver-spoons! Start har, marling-spikes!”</p>
<p>Stubb's exordium to him crew is given yah at large, cause him did have rather a peculiar way fi talk to dem in general, an especially in inculcating di religion a rowing. But yuh nuh suppose fram dis specimen a him sermonizings dat him eva fly into downright passions wid him congregation. No sah; an deh did consist him chief peculiarity. Im woulda seh di most terrific tings to im crew, inna a tone so strangely compounded a fun an fury, an di fury did look so calculated merely as a spice to di fun, dat no oarsman coulda hear such queer invocations widout pull fi dear life, an yet pull fi di mere joke a di ting. Besides him all di time look so easy an indolent himself, so loungingly managed him steering-oar, an so broadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—dat di mere sight a such a yawning commander, by sheer force a contrast, did act like a charm upon di crew. Den agen, Stubb was one a dem odd sort a humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as fi put all inferiors pan dem guard inna di matter a obeying dem.</p>
<p>In obedience to a sign fram Ahab, Starbuck did a pul obliquely across Stubb's bow; an wen fi a minute or so di two boats dem did pretty near to each other, Stubb hail di mate.</p>
<p>“Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat deh, ahoy! a word wid yuh, sir, if yuh please!”</p>
<p>“Halloa!” Starbuck return, turning round not a single inch as him did a talk; still earnestly but whisperingly urging him crew; him face set like a flint fram Stubb's.</p>
<p>“Weh yuh tink bout dem yellow bwoy deh, sir!”</p>
<p>“Smuggled on board, somehow, before di ship sailed. (Strong, strong, boys!)” inna a whisper to him crew, den speaking out loud again: “A sad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe har, seethe har, my lads!) but neva mind, Mr. Stubb, all fi di bes. Mek all yuh crew pull, strong, (Spp, mi man dem will come. spring!) Hogsheads a sperm deh ahead, Mr. Stubb, an a dat yuh come fah (Pull, mi boys!) Sperm, sperm a di play!</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, mi did tink as much,” Stubb seh, wen di boats dem did a diverge, “as soon as mi clapt eye pan 'em, mi did tink so. Aye, an a dat him did go inna di afta hold fi, so often, as Dough-Boy lang suspect. Dem did hide dung deh. Di White Whale's at di bottom a it Well, so cant be it! help! Aal rait! Give way, man!</p>
<p>Now di advent a dem outlandish strangers deh at such a critical instant as di lowering a di boats dem fram di deck, dis neva unreasonably awaken a sort a superstitious amazement inna some a di ship's company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time previous get abroad mongst dem, though indeed not credited den, dis had in some small measure prepared dem fi di event. It tek off di extreme edge a dem wonder; an so weh wid all dis an Stubb's confident way a accounting fi dem appearance, dem did fi di time free fram superstitious surmisings; though di affair still lef abundant room fi all manner a wild conjectures as to dark Ahab's precise agency inna di matter fram di beginning. Fi mi, mi silently memba di mysterious shadows dem weh mi did si a creeping pan di Pequod during di dim Nantucket dawn, as well as di enigmatical hintings a di unaccountable Elijah.</p>
<p>Meantime, Ahab, outa hearing a him officers, afta him did side di furthest to windward, did still a range ahead a di ada boats dem; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew did a pul him. Dem deh tiger yellow creatures a him did look all steel an whalebone; like five trip-hammers dem rose an fall wid regular strokes a strength, weh periodically staat di boat along di wata like a horizontal burst boiler outa a Mississippi steamer. As fi Fedallah, weh dem did si a pull di harpooneer oar, him did throw aside him black jacket, an display him naked chest wid di whole part a him body above di gunwale, clearly cut against di alternating depressions a di watery horizon; while at di ada end a di boat Ahab, wid one arm, like a fencer's, throw half backward inna di air, as if fi counterbalance any tendency fi trip; Ahab did a manage him steering oar steadily as in a thousand boat lowerings ere di White Whale did torn him. All at once di outstretched arm gi a peculiar motion an den stay fix, while di boat five oars dem did a peak simultaneously. Boat an crew did a sidong motionless pan di sea. Instantly di three spread boats dem inna di rear pause pan dem way. Di whales dem did irregularly settle bodyly dung inna di blue, so giving no distantly discernible token a di movement, though fram him closer vicinity Ahab did observe it.</p>
<p>“Every man look out along dem oars!” Starbuck baal out. “Yuh, Queequeg, stan up!”</p>
<p>Nimbly springing up pan di triangular raised box inna di bow, di savage did a stan up erect deh, an wid intensely eager eyes gazed off towards di spot weh di chase did last been described. Likewise pan di extreme stern a di boat weh it did also triangularly platformed level wid di gunwale, Starbuck himself did a balance himself coolly an adroitly to di jerking tossings a him chip a craft, an silently eyeing di vast blue eye a di sea.</p>
<p>Not very far distant Flask's boat did a lie dong breathlessly still; it commander recklessly stan up pan di top a di loggerhead, a stout sort a post rooted inna di keel, an rising some two feet above di level a di stern platform. Dem use it fe catch turns wid di whale line. It top no more spacious dan di palm a one man's han, an stan up pan such a base as dat, Flask did look like him did a perched at di mast-head a some ship weh did sunk to all but har trucks. But likkle King-Post did small an short, an at di same time likkle King-Post did full a big an tall ambition, so dat dis loggerhead stand-point a him did by no means satisfy King-Post.</p>
<p>“Mi kyaahn si chrii sii aaf, tip wi op wan oar de, an mek mi go pan dat.”</p>
<p>Pan dis, Daggoo, wid either han pan di gunwale fi steady him way, swiftly slid aft, an den erect himself volunteer him lofty shoulders fi a pedestal.</p>
<p>“Good a mast-head as any, sir. Yuh ago mount?”</p>
<p>“Dat mi will, an tank yuh very much, mi fine fellow, only mi wish yuh fifty fut taller.”</p>
<p>Wen im plant im fut dem faam gens tuu apazit plank a di buot, di gigantic negro, stooping likl, prizent im flat palm tu Flask fut, an den put Flask han pan im hearse-plumed ed an bid im spring az imself shuda tos, wid wan dexterous fling lan di likl man ai an dry pan im shuolda. An yahso Flask did a stan up now, Daggoo wid one lifted arm a furnishing him wid a breastband fi lean against an steady himself by.</p>
<p>At any time it is a strange sight to di tyro fi see wid what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill di whaleman will maintain an erect posture inna him boat, even wen dem pitch bout by di most riotously perverse an cross-running seas. Still more strange fi see him giddily perched upon di loggerhead itself, unda such circumstances. But di sight a likkle Flask mount pan gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; fi sustain himself wid a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, di noble negro to every roll a di sea harmoniously roll him fine form. Pan him broad back, flaxen-haired Flask did look like a snow-flake. Di bearer look nobler dan di rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious likkle Flask woulda now an den stamp wid impatience; but not one added heave did him gi di negro's lordly chest. So mi si Passion an Vanity a stamp di living magnanimous earth, but di earth neva alter har tides an har seasons fi dat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Stubb, di third mate, betray no such far-gazing solicitudes. Di whales dem mighta did mek one a dem regular soundings, not a temporary dive fram mere fright; an if dat was di case, Stubb, as him wont in such cases, it seems, did resolve fi solace di languishing interval wid him pipe. Him tek it weh fram him hatband, weh him always wear it aslant like a feather. Im load it, an ram home di loading wid im thumb-end; but hardly him did ignite him match across di rough sandpaper a him han, wen Tashtego, him harpooneer, whose eyes did a set to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly drop like light fram him erect attitude to him seat, a cry out inna a quick phrensy a hurry, “Down, dung all, an dem deh deh!”</p>
<p>To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign a herring, woulda been visible at dat moment; notn but a troubled bit a greenish white water, an thin scattered puffs a vapor hovering ova it, an suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like di confused scud fram white rolling billows. Di air roun suddenly vibrate an tingled, as it were, like di air ova intensely heated plates a iron. Anda dis atmospheric waving an curling, an partially anda a thin layer a waata, tu, di whales dem did a swim. Seen in advance a all di ada indications, di puffs a vapor dem spout, seem dem forerunning couriers an detached flying outriders.</p>
<p>All four boats dem did a look pan dat deh one spot a troubled water an air. But it bade fair fi outstrip dem; it fly on an on, as a mass a interblending bubbles weh did a borne dung a rapid stream fram di hills.</p>
<p>“Pull, pull, mi good boys,” seh Starbuck, inna di lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to him man dem; while di sharp fixed glance fram him eyes did a dart straight ahead a di bow, almost did look like two visible needles inna two unerring binnacle compasses. Im neva se notn tu im kruu, duo, an im kruu neva se notn tu im. Only di silence a di boat did at intervals startlingly pierced by one a him peculiar whispers, now harsh wid command, now soft wid entreaty.</p>
<p>How different di loud likkle King-Post. “Sing out an se somting, mi hearties. Roar an pull, mi thunderbolts! Beach mi, beach mi pan dem black backs, bwoy dem; only do dat fi mi, an mi ago sign ova to yuh mi Martha's Vineyard plantation, bwoys; including wife an pickney dem, bwoys. Lay mi on—lay mi on! O Lord, Lord! but mi shall go stark, staring see wait wata!” An so shouting, him pull him hat fram him head, an stamp up an dung pan it; den pick it up, flirt it far off pan di sea; an finally fall to rearing an plunging inna di boat's stern like a crazed colt fram di prairie.</p>
<p>“Look pan dat deh chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, wid him unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between him teet, at a short distance, followed after—“Im got fits, dat Flask have. Fits? yes, gi him fits—dat a di very word—pitch fits into 'em. Merrily, Merriive, Pudding, fi yuh supper. know;—merry's di word. Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But weh di devil yuh a hurry bout? seh, an burst all a yuh liver an lungs!”</p>
<p>But weh it was dat inscrutable Ahab seh to dat tiger-yellow crew a him—dem was words best omitted yah; fi yuh live unda di blessed light a di evangelical lan. Only di infidel sharks dem inna di audacious seas dem may gi ear to such words, wen, wid tornado brow, an eyes a red murder, an foam-glued lips, Ahab leap afta him prey.</p>
<p>Miinwail, aal a di buot dem tier aan. Di repeated specific allusions a Flask to “dat whale,” as him call di fictitious monster weh him declare fi be incessantly tantalizing him boat's bow wid its tail—dem allusions a him did at times so vivid an life-like, dat dem woulda cause some one or two a him man dem fi snatch a fearful look ova di shoulda. But dis was against all rule; fi di oarsman dem haffi put out dem eyes, an ram a skewer chruu dem neck; usage pronouncing seh dem mus have no organs but ears, an no limbs but arms, inna dem critical moments yah.</p>
<p>A did a sight full a quick wonder an awe! Di vast swells a di omnipotent sea; di surging, hollow roar dem mek, as dem roll along di eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls inna a boundless bowling-green; di brief suspended agony a di boat, as it woulda tip fi an instant pan di knife-like edge a di sharper waves, weh almost did look like it did a threatening fi cut it inna two; di sudden profound dip inna di watery glens an hollows; di keen spurrings an goadings fi gain di top a di opposite hill; di headlong, sled-like slide dung it ada side;—all dem deh, wid di cries a di headsmen an harpooneers, an di shuddering gasps a di oarsmen, wid di wondrous sight a di ivory Pequod bearing dung upon har boats wid outstretched sails, like a wild hen afta har screamining brood—dis all was thrilling;</p>
<p>Not di raw recruit, marching fram di bosom a him wife inna di fever heat a him first battle; not di dead man's ghost weh did a encounter di first unknown phantom inna di ada worl;—none a dem can feel stranger an stronger emotions dan dat deh man deh, weh fi di first time find himself a pul inna di charmed, churned circle a di hunted sperm whale.</p>
<p>Di dancing white water weh di chase mek did a get more an more visible, owing to di increasing darkness a di dun cloud-shadows weh did a fling pan di sea. Di jets a vapor no blend no more, but tilt everyweh to right an left; di whales dem did look like dem did a separate dem wake. Di boat dem did pull more apart; Starbuck a gi chase to three whales running dead to leeward. Wi sail did set now, an, wid di still a rise wind, wi rush along; di boat did a go wid such madness thru di wata, dat di lee oars dem coulda scarcely be worked rapidly enough fi escape being torn fram di row-locks.</p>
<p>Likl afta dat wi did a run chruu a suffusing wide veil a mist; no ship nor boat fi be seen.</p>
<p>“Give way, man,” Starbuck whispered, drawing still further aft di sheet a him sail; “a time fi kill a fish yet before di squall come. A white wata again!—close to! Spring!”</p>
<p>Soon afta, two cries in quick succession pan each side a wi denote seh di ada boats dem did get fast; but hardly dem neva hear dem, wen wid a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck seh: “Stand up!” an Queequeg, harpoon inna him han, sprang to him foot.</p>
<p>Though not one a di oarsmen dem did a face di life an death peril so close to dem ahead, yet wid dem eyes pan di intense countenance a di mate inna di stern a di boat, dem did know seh di imminent instant did come; dem hear, too, a enormous wallowing sound as a fifty elephants a stir inna dem litter. Meanwhile di boat did still a boom chruu di mist, di waves dem did a curl an a hiss roun wi like di erected crests a enraged serpents.</p>
<p>“A fi im hump dat. <i>De</i> , <i>de</i> , gi im it!” Starbuck whispered.</p>
<p>A short rushing sound leap outa di boat; it was di darted iron a Queequeg. Den all in one welded commotion come an invisible push fram astern, while forward di boat did a look striking pan a ledge; di sail collapse an explode; a gush a scalding vapor shot up near by; someting roll an tumble like an earthquake unda wi. Di whole crew did half suffocated as dem did a toss helter-skelter inna di white curdling cream a di squall. Squall, whale, an harpoon did all blend tugeda; an di whale, weh did jus graze by di iron, escape.</p>
<p>Though completely swamped, di boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it we pick up di floating oars, an lashing dem across di gunwale, tumbled back to wi places. Deh wi sidong op tu wi nii dem inna di sii, di waata a kova evri rib an plank, so dat tu wi yai dem we did a luk dong di craft we did a sospen did luk laik wan koral buot we gruo op tu wi fram di batam a di uoshan.</p>
<p>Di wind increase to a howl; di waves dem did a dash dem bucklers tugeda; di whole squall did a roar, fork, an crackle roun wi like a white fire pan di prairie, in which, unconsumed, we did a burn; immortal inna dem deh jaws a death! In vain wi hail di ada boat dem; as well roar to di live coals dung di chimney a one flaming furnace as hail dem deh boats inna dat deh storm. Meanwhile di driving scud, rack, an mist, did a grow darker wid di shadows a night; no sign a di ship coulda be seen. Di rising sea forbid all attempts fi bale out di boat. Di oars dem did useless as propellers, an dem did a perform now di office a life-preservers. So, cutting di lashing a di waterproof match keg, afta plenty failures Starbuck contrive fi ignite di lamp inna di lantern; den stretch it pan a waif pole, gi it to Queequeg as di standard-bearer a dis forlorn hope. Deh, den, him sidong, a hold up dat deh imbecile candle inna di heart a dat deh almighty forlornness. Deh, den, him did sidong, di sign an symbol a wan man widout faith, hopelessly holding up hope inna di midst a despair.</p>
<p>Wet, drenched through, an shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we lift up wi eyes as di dawn come on. Di mist still did a spread ova di sea, di empty lantern did a lay crush inna di bottom a di boat. Suddenly Queequeg staat up him foot dem, hollow him han to him ear. Wi all hear a faint creaking, as a ropes an yards hitherto muffled by di storm. Di sound did a come nearer an nearer; di thick mists dem did dimly part by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, wi all sprang inna di sea as di ship at last loom in view, bearing right dung upon wi widin a distance a not much more dan it length.</p>
<p>Floating pan di waves we si di abandoned boat, as fi one instant it toss an gaped unda di ship's bows like a chip at di base a a cataract; an den di vast hull roll ova it, an it neva seen no more til it come up weltering astern. Again we swim fi it, get dash against it by di seas, an we at last get tek up an safely land pan board. Bifuo di squall did come close, di ada boats dem did cut loose fram dem fish an go back to di ship inna good time. Di ship did gi wi up, but did still a cruise, if it coulda light pan some token a wi perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00054">CHAPTER 49. Di Hyena.</h2>
<p>Deh deh certain queer times an occasions inna dis strange mixed affair weh we call life wen a man tek dis whole universe fi a vast practical joke, though di wit deh him but dimly discern, an more dan suspects seh di joke is at nobody's expense but him own. However, notn no dispirits, an notn no look worth while disputing. Him bolt dung all events, all creeds, an beliefs, an persuasions, all hard tings visible an invisible, neva mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles dung bullets an gun flints. An as fi di likl difficulties an worryings, prospects a sudden disaster, peril a life an limb; all dem, an death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, an jolly punches inna di side bestowed by di unseen an unaccountable old joker. Dat deh odd sort a wayward mood weh mi a talk bout, come ova a man only inna some time a extreme tribulation; it come inna di very midst a him earnestness, so dat weh jus before mighta did look to him a ting most momentous, now seem but a part a di general joke. Notn nuh deh like di perils a whaling fi breed dis free an easy sort a genial, desperado philosophy; an wid it mi now regard dis whole voyage a di Pequod, an di great White Whale its object.</p>
<p>“Queequeg,” seh mi, wen dem did drag mi, di laas man, to di deck, an mi did still a shake miself inna mi jacket fi fling off di wata; “Queequeg, mi fine fren, dis sort a ting often happen?” Widout much emotion, though soaked through jus like mi, him gi mi fi andastan seh such tings did often happen.</p>
<p>“Mr. Stubb,” seh mi, turning to dat worthy, who, buttoned up inna him oil-jacket, did a smoke him pipe inna di rain; “Mista Stubb, mi tink mi hear yuh seh dat a all whaleman yuh eva meet, wi chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, a di most careful an prudent. Mi suppose den, dat going plump pan a flying whale wid yuh sail set inna a foggy squall a di height a a whaleman's discretion?”</p>
<p>“Certain. Mi don lower fi whales fram a leaking ship inna a gale off Cape Horn.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Flask,” mi seh, turn to likkle King-Post, weh did a stan up close by; “yuh experience inna dem ting deh, an mi no. Yuh wi tell mi if it a one unalterable law inna dis fishery, Mr. Flask, fi an oarsman break him own back pulling himself back-foremost inna death's jaws?”</p>
<p>“Yuh cyan twist dat smaller?” Flask seh. “Yes, dat a di law. Mi shuda like fi si a boat's crew a back water up to a whale face foremost. Ha, ha! di whale woulda gi dem squint fi squint, mind dat!”</p>
<p>Yahso den, fram three impartial witnesses, mi did have a deliberate statement a di entire case. Considering, therefore, dat squalls an capsizings inna di wata an consequent bivouacks pan di deep, was matters of common occurrence inna dis kind a life; considering dat at di superlatively critical instant a going on to di whale mi haffi resign mi life inna di hands a him weh steer di boat—oftentimes a fellow weh at dat deh very moment deh inna him impetuousness upon di point a scuttling di craft wid him own frantic stampings; considering dat di particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving on to him whale almost in the teet of a squall, and considering dat Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous fi him great heedfulness inna di fishery; considering seh mi belong to dis uncommonly prudent Starbuck's boat; an finally considering in what a devil's chase mi did implicated, touching di White Whale: tek all tings tugeda, mi seh, mi did tink mi might as well go below an mek a rough draft a mi will. “Queequeg,” seh mi, “come along, yuh ago be mi lawyer, executor, an legatee.”</p>
<p>It may seem strange dat a all man sailors shuda be tinkering at dem last wills an testaments, but nuh people inna di worl more fond a dat deh diversion. Dis was di fourth time inna mi nautical life dat mi did do di same ting. Afta di ceremony did don pan di present occasion, mi did feel all di easier; a stone did roll weh fram mi heart. Besides, all di days mi shuda live now woulda be as good as di days weh Lazarus did live afta him resurrection; a supplementary clean gain a so many months or weeks as di case might be. Mi survive miself; mi death an burial did lock up inna mi chest. Mi look roun mi tranquilly an contentedly, like a quiet ghost wid a clean conscience sitting inside di bars a one snug family vault.</p>
<p>Now den, mi tink, unconsciously rolling up di sleeves a mi frock, yahso go fi a cool, collected dive at death an destruction, an di devil fetch di hindmost.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00055">CHAPTER 50. Ahab Boat an Crew. Fedallah.</h2>
<p>“A who woulda did tink it, Flask!” Stubb baal out; “if mi did have only one leg yuh wouldn't ketch mi inna a boat, unless maybe fi stop di plug-hole wid mi timber toe. Oh! him a one wonderful old man!”</p>
<p>“Mi no tink it so strange, afta all, pan dat deh account,” seh Flask. “If him leg did off at di hip, now, it woulda be a different ting. Dat woulda disable him; but him have one knee, an good part a di other left, yuh know.”</p>
<p>“Mi no nuo dat, mi likl man, mi neva si im niil dong yet.”</p>
<p>Among whale-wise people it have often been argued whether, considering di paramount importance a him life to di success a di voyage, it is right fi a whaling captain jeopardize dat deh life inna di active perils a di chase. So Tamerlane's soldiers often argue wid tears inna dem eyes, weda dat deh invaluable life a him shuda be carryed into di thickest a di fight.</p>
<p>But wid Ahab di kweschan did tek a modified aspect. Considering dat wid two legs man is jus a hobbling wight inna all times a danger; considering dat di pursuit a whales is always unda great an extraordinary difficulties; dat every individual moment, indeed, den comprise a peril; anda dem circumstances yah it wise fi any maimed man go inna a whale-boat inna di hunt? As a general ting, di joint-owners a di Pequod mus did plainly tink not.</p>
<p>Ahab did well know seh although him fren dem a yaad woulda tink likkle bout him enterin a boat inna certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes a di chase, fi di sake a being near di scene a action an gi him orders in person, yet fi Captain Ahab fi have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman inna di hunt—above fi Captain Ahab fi get extra man wid five supplied dat deh same boat's crew, him well know seh such generous conceits neva did enter di head a di owners a di Pequod. So him neva did a solicit a boat's crew fram dem, an him neva did in any way hint him desires pan dat deh head. Nevertheless him did tek private measures a him own touching all dat matter. Til Cabaco's published discovery, di sailors dem did likkle foreseen it, though fi be sure wen, afta dem did a likkle while outa port, all hands did conclude di customary business a fitting di whaleboats fi service; wen some time afta dis Ahab did now an den find himself bestirring inna di matter a mek thole-pins wid him own han dem fi weh dem did tink seh a one a di spare boat dem, an even solicitously cutting di small wooden skewers dem, weh wen di line a run out dem pin ova di groove inna di bow: wen all dis did a observe inna him an particularly solicitously inna him haat coat sheathing inna di bottom a di boat, as if fi mek it beta widstand di pointed pressure a him ivory limb; an also di anxiety him evinced inna exactly shaping di thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, di horizontal piece inna di boat's bow fi brace di knee against inna darting or stabbing at di whale; wen dem did a observe how often him did a stan up inna dat deh boat wid him solitary knee fix inna di semi-circular depression inna di cleat, an wid di carpenter's chisel gouged out a likkle yah an straighten it a likkle deh; all dem ting deh, mi seh, did awaken plenty interest an curiosity at di time. But almost everybody did suppose seh dis particular preparative heedfulness inna Ahab mus only be wid a view to di ultimate chase a Moby Dick; fi him did already reveal him intention fi hunt dat deh mortal monster inna person. But such a supposition did by no means involve di remotest suspicion as to any boat's crew being assigned to dat deh boat.</p>
<p>Now, wid di subordinate phantoms, weh wonder did remain soon waned weh; fi inna a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now an den such unaccountable odds an ends a strange nations come up fram di unknown nooks an ash-holes a di earth fi man dem floating outlaws a whalers; an di ship dem demself often pick up such queer castaway creatures weh dem find a tossing bout di open sea pan planks, bits a wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, an weh not; dat Beelzebub himself might climb up di side an step dung inna di cabin fi chat wid di captain, an it wouldn't create any unsubduable excitement inna di forecastle.</p>
<p>But be all dis as it may, certain it is dat while di subordinate phantoms soon find dem place among di crew, though still as it was somehow distinct fram dem, yet dat hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to di last. Wen him come inna a mannerly worl like dis, by what sort a unaccountable tie him soon evinced himself fi be linked wid Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as fi have some sort a half-hinted influence; Heaven know, but it mighta did even authority ova him; all dis nobadi neva know. But one cyaan sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. Im was such a creature as civilized, domestic people inna di temperate zone only see inna dem dreams, an dat but dimly; but di like a who now an den glide mongst di unchanging Asiatic communities, especially di Oriental isles to di east a di continent—dem insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, weh even inna dem modern days deh still preserve much a di ghostly aboriginalness a earth's primal generations, wen di memory a di first man was a distinct, an recollection all him descendants, unknowning weh him come fram, look pan each ada as real phantoms, an ask di sun an di moon why dem did mek dem an to weh end; wen though, according to Genesis, di angels indeed consorted wid di daughta dem a man, di devils dem also, add di uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00056">CHAPTER 51. Di Spirit-Spout.</h2>
<p>Days, weeks pass, an unda easy sail, di ivory Pequod did slowly sweep across four several cruising-grounds; dat off di Azores; off di Cape de Verdes; pan di Plate (so called), being off di mout a di Rio de la Plata; an di Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly fram St. Helena.</p>
<p>A did while mi did a glide thru dem latter waters deh dat one serene an moonlight night, wen all di waves dem did a roll by like scrolls a silver; an, by dem soft, suffusing seethings, mek weh did look like a silvery silence, not a solitude; pan such a silent night a silvery jet did deh far inna di white bubbles dem at di bow. Lit up by di moon, it look celestial; did look like some plumed an glittering god did a up fram di sea. Fedallah fos diskraib dis jet. Fi dem moonlight nights deh, it was him wont fi mount to di main-mast head, an stand a look-out deh, wid di same precision as if it was day. An yet, though herds a whales did si by night, not one whaleman inna a hundred woulda venture a lowering fi dem. Yuh may tink wid weh emotions, den, di seamen dem did a si dis old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; him turban an di moon, companions inna one sky. But wen, afta him spen him uniform interval deh fi several successive nights widout uttering a single sound; wen, afta all dis silence, him unearthly voice did hear a announce dat silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner staat up him foot dem as if some winged spirit did light inna di rigging, an hail di mortal crew. “A deh so she blow!” If di trump a judgment did blow, dem couldn't have quiver more; yet still dem neva feel no terror; radda pleasure. For though it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was di cry, an so deliriously exciting, dat almost every soul on board instinctively desire a lowering.</p>
<p>Walking di deck wid quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab command di t'gallant sails an royals fi set, an every stunsail spread. Di bes man inna di ship haffi tek di helm. Den, wid every mast-head manned, di piled-up craft roll dung before di wind. Di strange, upheaving, lifting tendency a di taffrail breeze weh did a full di hollows a so many sails, mek di buoyant, hovering deck feel like air unda di feet dem; while still she rush along, as if two antagonistic influences did a struggle inna har—one fi mount direct to heaven, di other fi drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. An if yuh did watch Ahab face dat deh night, yuh woulda tink seh inna him too different tings did a war. While him one live leg did a mek lively echoes along di deck, every stroke a him dead limb did a sound like a coffin-tap. Pan laif an det dis uol man waak. But though di ship so swiftly sped, an though fram every eye, like arrows, di eager glances shot, yet di silvery jet neva seen more dat deh night. Every sailor swear seh him see it once, but not a secan time.</p>
<p>Dis midnight-spout did almost grow a forgetten ting, wen, some days afta, lo! at di same silent hour, it did announce again: again it did describe by all; but wen dem mek sail fi overtake it, once more it disappear as if it neva deh deh. An so it did a serve wi nait afta nait, til nobadi neva ier it bot fi wanda bout it. Mysteriously jetted inna di clear moonlight, or starlight, as di case might be; disappearing again fi one whole day, or two days, or three; an somehow seeming at every distinct repetition fi be advancing still further an further inna wi van, dis solitary jet seemed fi ever alluring us on.</p>
<p>Nor wid di immemorial superstition a dem race, an in accordance wid di preternaturalness, as it did look like, weh inna nuff tings did invest di Pequod, dem did deh deh wanting some a di seamen dem weh did swore dat whenever an weh dem did describe; at however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes, dat unnearable spout was cast by one self-same whale; an dat deh whale, Moby Dick. Fi a time, deh reign, too, a sense a peculiar dread at dis flitting apparition, as if it did a treacherously beckoning wi on an on, in order dat di monster coulda turn round upon wi, an rend wi at last inna di remotest an most savage seas.</p>
<p>Dem temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous potency fram di contrasting serenity a di weather, in which, beath all it blue blandness, some tink seh deh did a lurk a devilish charm, as fi days an days we voyage along, thru seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, dat all space, in vengageful, fi revenge did look like it did a vacate itself a life before wi urn-like prow.</p>
<p>But, at last, wen wi turn to di eastward, di Cape winds staat howling roun wi, an wi rise an fall pan di long, troubled seas dem weh deh deh; wen di ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bow to di blast, an gore di dark waves inna har madness, til, like showers a silver chips, di foam-flakes fly ova har bulwarks; den all dis desolate vacuity a life gaan weh, but gi place to sights more dismal dan before.</p>
<p>Close to wi bows, strange forms inna di wata did a darted hither an thither before wi; while thick inna wi rear did a fly di inscrutable sea-ravens. An every morning, perched pan wi stays, rows a dem birds deh did si; an spite a wi hootings, fi a long time obstinately clung to di hemp, as if dem did a consider wi ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a ting weh appoint to desolation, an therefore fit roosting-place fi dem homeless selves. An heaved an heaved, still unrestingly heaved di black sea, as if its vast tides was a conscience; an di great mundane soul did inna anguish an remorse fi di long sin an suffering it did breed.</p>
<p>Cape a Good Hope, dem call yuh? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called of yore; fi lang allured by di perfidious silences weh before did attend wi, wi did find wiself launched inna dis tormented sea, weh guilty beings did transform inna dem fowls an dem fish deh, did look like dem did a swim on everlastingly widout any haven inna store, or beat dat black air widout any horizon. But calm, snow-white, an unvarying; still a direct it fountain a feathers to di sky; still beckoning wi on fram before, di solitary jet woulda at times be described.</p>
<p>Durin all dis blackness a di elements, Ahab, though assuming fi di time di almost continual command a di drenched an dangerous deck, manifested di gloomiest reserve; an more seldom dan eva address him mates. Inna tempestuous times like dem yah, afta everyting above an aloft get secure, nutten more can be done but passively fi wait di issue a di gale. Den Captain an crew become practical fatalists. So, wid him ivory leg insert inna it accustomed hole, an wid one han firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab fi hours an hours woulda stan up a look dead to windward, while an occasional squall a sleet or snow woulda all but congeal him very eyelashes tugeda. Meantime, di crew weh did a drive fram di forward part a di ship by di perilous seas weh burstingly break ova it bows, did a stan up inna one line along di bulwarks inna di waist; an di beta fi guard against di leaping waves, each man did slip himself inna a sort a bowline secure to di rail, in which him swing as inna a loosened belt. Few or no words did a seh; an di silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors inna wax, day afta day tore on through all di swift madness an gladness a di demoniac waves. By night di same muteness a humanity before di shrieks a di ocean prevail; still inna silence di man dem swing inna di bowlines; still wordless Ahab did stan up to di blast. Even wen wearied nature did a demand repose him wouldn't seek dat deh repose inna him hammock. Neva coulda Starbuck forget di ole man's aspect, wen one night wen him did a go dung inna di cabin fi mark how di barometer did a stan, him si him wid closed eyes a sidong straight inna him floor-screwed chair; di rain an half-melted sleet a di storm fram weh him did have some time before did come out, still slowly dripping fram di unremoved hat an coat. Pan di table beside him lay unrolled one a dem charts a tides an currents weh dem did a taak bout before. Him lantern swing fram him tightly clenched han. Though di body did erect, di head did fling back so dat di closed eyes dem did a point towards di needle a di tell-tale weh did a swing fram a beam inna di ceiling.*</p>
<p>*Di cabin-compass dem call di tell-tale, cause widout going to di compass at di helm, di Captain, while below, can inform himself a di course a di ship.</p>
<p>Terrible old man! tink Starbuck wid a shier, sleeping inna dis gale, still yuh steadfastly a look pan yuh purpose.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00057">CHAPTER 52. Di Albatross.</h2>
<p>South-eastward fram di Cape, off di distant Crozetts, a good cruising ground fi Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, di Goney (Albatross) by name. As she slowly did a draw nigh, fram mi lofty perch at di fore-mast-head, mi did have a good view a dat deh sight so remarkable to a tyro inna di far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, an long absent fram home.</p>
<p>As if di waves dem did fullers, dis craft did bleach like di skeleton a one stranded walrus. All dung har sides, dis spectral appearance did trace wid long channels a reddened rust, while all har spars an har rigging did like di thick branch a trees furred ova wid hoar-frost. Only har lower sails dem did set. A wild sight it was fi see har long-bearded look-outs at dem three mast-heads deh. Dem did look like dem did a wier di skin a beast, so dem did torn an bepatch di raiment weh did survive nearly four years a cruising. Dem did a stan op inna iron hoops weh did nail to di mast, an dem did a swing an swing ova a fathomless sea; an though, wen di ship slowly glide close unda wi stern, we six man inna di air come so nier to each other dat we might almost have leap fram di mast-heads a one ship to dem a di nex one; yet, dem forlorn-looking fishermen deh, mildly eyeing wi as dem pass, neva seh one word to wi own look-outs, while di quarter-deck hail did a hear fram below.</p>
<p>“Ship ahoy! Yuh si di White Whale?”</p>
<p>But as di strange captain, weh did a lean ova di pallid bulwarks, did a put him trumpet to him mout, it somehow fall fram him han inna di sea; an di wind now a rise amain, him inna vain strive fi mek himself heard widout it. Meantime him ship did still a increase di distance between. While inna various silent ways di seamen dem a di Pequod did a evincing dem observance a dis ominous incident at di first mere mention a di White Whale's name to anodda ship, Ahab fi a moment paused; it almost did look like him woulda did lower a boat fi board di stranger, if di threatening wind neva forbad. But tek advantage a him windward position, him again seize him trumpet, an knowing by har aspect seh di stranger vessel was a Nantucketer an shortly bound home, him loudly hailed—“Ahoy deh! Dis a di Pequod, bound round di worl! Tell dem fi address all future letters to di Pacific ocean dis time an if mi nuh deh home, tell dem fi address dem! tuh --"</p>
<p>At dat deh moment di two wake dem did fairly cross, an instantly, den, in accordance wid dem singular ways, shoals a small harmless fish, weh fi some days before did a swim placidly by wi side, did a darted weh wid weh did a look like dem did a shuddering fins, an did a range demself fore an aft wid di stranger's flanks. Though inna di course a him continual voyagings Ahab mus often before have notice a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, di veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.</p>
<p>“Swim weh fram mi, yuh?” murmured Ahab, gazing ova inna di wata. It did look like likkle inna di words, but di tone did a convey more a deep helpless sadness dan di insane old man did eva before evinced. Bot wen im ton tu di stierman, uu so far did a uol di ship ina di briiz fi diminish ar hedway, im baal out ina im uol laiyan vais,—“Up helm! Kip ar aaf roun di worl!”</p>
<p>Round di worl! A nuff ting deh inna dat deh sound fi inspire proud feelings; but weh all dat circumnavigation a gwaan? Only chruu numbaless perils to di very point weh wi staat, weh dem weh wi lef behind secure, did deh all di time before wi.</p>
<p>If dis worl did a endless plain, an by sailing eastward we coulda fi eva reach new distances, an discover sights more sweet an strange dan any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, den deh did have promise inna di voyage. But in pursuit a dem far mysteries we dream bout, or in tormented chase a dat demon phantom weh, some time or other, swim before all human hearts; wile dem a chase such ova dis round globe, dem either lead wi on inna barren mazes or midway lef wi whelmed.</p>
