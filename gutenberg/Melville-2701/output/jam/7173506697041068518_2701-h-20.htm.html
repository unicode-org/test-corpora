<h2 id="pgepubid00107">CHAPTER 101. Di Decanter.</h2>
<p>Ere di English ship fade fram sight, be it set dung yah, dat she did come fram London, an dem did name afta di late Samuel Enderby, merchant a dat deh city, di original a di famous whaling house a Enderby &amp; Sons; a house weh inna mi poor whaleman's opinion, come not far behind di united royal houses a di Tudors an Bourbons, in point a real historical interest. How long, prior to di year a wi Lord 1775, dis great whaling house did deh deh, mi numerous fish-documents nuh mek plain; but inna dat deh year (1775) it fit out di first English ships dem weh eva regularly hunt di Sperm Whale; though fi some score a years before (ever since 1726) wi valiant Coffins an Maceys a Nantucket an di Vineyard did inna large fleets pursue dat deh Leviathan, but only inna di North an South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded yah, dat di Nantucketers dem was di first among mankind fi harpoon wid civilized steel di great Sperm Whale; an dat fi half a century dem was di only people a di whole globe weh so harpoon him.</p>
<p>Inna 1778, a fine ship, di Amelia, fit out fi di express purpose, an at di sole charge a di vigorous Enderbys, boldly roun Cape Horn, an was di first among di nations fi lower a whale-boat a any sort inna di great South Sea. Di voyage was a skilful an lucky one; an returning to har berth wid har hold full a di precious sperm, di Amelia's example did soon follow by other ships, English an American, an so di vast Sperm Whale grounds a di Pacific did fling open. But not content wid dis good deed, di indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel an all him Sons—how many, dem mada only know—an unda dem immediate auspices, an partly, mi tink, at dem expense, di British govament did induce fi send di sloop-of-war Rattler pan a whaling voyage a discovery inna di South Sea. Command by a naval Post-Captain, di Rattler mek a rattling voyage a it, an did some service; how much nuh appear. But dis a nuh all. Inna 1819, di same house fit out a discovery whale ship a dem own, fi go pan a tasting cruise to di remote waters a Japan. Dat deh ship—we dem call di “Syren”—mek a noble experimental cruise; an a so di great Japanese Whaling Ground fos get generally known. Di Syren inna dis famous voyage did a command by a Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.</p>
<p>All honor to di Enderbies, therefore, whose house, mi tink, exist to di present day; though doubtless di original Samuel mus long ago did slip him cable fi di great South Sea a di ada world.</p>
<p>Di ship weh dem name afta him did worthy di honor, cause it did a very fast sailer an a did a noble craft every way. Mi board har once at midnight somweh off di Patagonian coast, an drink good flip dung inna di forecastle. A did a fine gam we did have, an dem was all trumps—every soul on board. A short life to dem, an a jolly death. An dat deh fine gam weh mi did have—lang, very long afta old Ahab touch har planks wid him ivory heel—it mind mi a di noble, solid, Saxon hospitality a dat deh ship; an mek mi parson forget mi, an di devil memba mi, if mi eva lose sight a it. Tun ova? Mi seh wi did flip? Yes, an wi flip it at di rate a ten gallons di hour; an wen di squall come (fi it squally off deh by Patagonia), an all hands—visitors an all—dem did a call to reef topsails, wi did so top-heavy dat wi did haffi swing each other aloft inna bowlines; an wi ignorantly furl di skirts a wi jackets dem inna di sails, so dat wi did a hang deh, reefed fast inna di howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, di masts dem neva go ovaboard; an by an by wi scramble dung, so sober, dat wi had to pass di flip again, though di savage salt spray bursting dung di forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted an pickled it to mi taste.</p>
<p>Di beef did fine—tough, but wid body inna it. Dem seh a bull-beef; adaz seh it was dromedary beef; but mi no know, fi certain, how dat did deh. Dem did have dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular, an indestructible dumplings. Mi did fancied seh yuh coulda feel dem, an roll dem bout inna yuh afta dem swallow dem. If yuh stoop ova too far forward, yuh risk dem pitching out a yuh like billiard-balls. Di bread—but dat couldn't be help; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, di bread did have di only fresh fare dem did have. But di forecastle neva very light, an it did very easy fi step ova inna a dark corner wen yuh nyam it. But all in all, tek har fram truck to helm, considering di dimensions a di cook's boilers, including him own live parchment boilers; fore an aft, mi seh, di Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; a good fare an plenty; fine flip an strong; crack fellows all, an capital fram boot heels to hat-band.</p>
<p>But why it was, tink yuh, dat di Samuel Enderby, an some ada English whalers mi know bout—not all though—a did such famous, hospitable ships; dat pass roun di beef, an di bread, an di can, an di joke; an yuh neva soon tired a eat, an drink, an laugh? Mi ago tell yuh. Di abunding good cheer a dem English whalers yah a matter fi historical research. Nor mi neva been at all sparing a historical whale research, wen it did look like it needed.</p>
<p>Di English dem did deh inna di whale fishery by di Hollanders, Zealanders, an Danes; fram whom dem get plenty terms weh still deh deh inna di fishery; an weh more, dem fat old fashions, touching plenty fi eat an drink. For, as a general ting, di English merchant-ship scrimps har crew; but not so di English whale. So, inna di English, dis ting a whaling good cheer a nuh normal an natural, but incidental an particular; an, so, mus have some special origin, weh deh yah point out, an wi a go still further elucidate.</p>
<p>Durin mi researches inna di Leviathanic histories, mi stumble pan an ancient Dutch volume, weh, by di musty whaling smell a it, mi did know seh mosi did bout whalers. Di title was, “Dan Coopman,” why mi conclude seh dis mus be di invaluable memoirs a some Amsterdam cooper inna di fishery, as every whale ship mus carry its cooper. Mi did get reinforced inna dis opinion wen mi si seh a did di production a one “Fitz Swackhammer.” But mi fren Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man, professor a Low Dutch an High German inna di college a Santa Claus an St. Pott's, to whom mi gi di work fi translation, an gi him a box a sperm candles fi him trouble—dis same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as him did a spie di book, did assure mi seh “D Coop” but “The Merchant The Merchant.” In short, dis ancient an learned Low Dutch book did a treat bout di commerce a Holland; an, mongx ada subjects, did have a very interesting account a it whale fishery. An inna dis chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” dat mi find a long detailed list a di outfits fi di larders an cellars a 180 sail a Dutch whalemen; fram which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, mi transcribe di following:</p>
<p>400,000 lbs. a beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. a stock fish. 550,000 lbs. a biscuit. 72,000 lbs. a soft bread. 2,800 firkins a butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel &amp; Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels a beer.</p>
<p>Most statistical tables dem parchingly dry inna di reading; not so inna di present case, however, weh di reader get flood wid whole pipes, barrels, quarts, an gills a good gin an good cheer.</p>
<p>At di time, mi did devote three days to di studious digesting a all dis beer, beef, an bread, during which many profound thoughts did incidentally suggested to mi, capable of a transcendental an Platonic application; an, furthermore, mi compiled supplementary tables a mi own, touching di probable quantity a stock-fish, etc., weh every Low Dutch harpooneer did a consume inna dat deh ancient Greenland an Spitzbergen whale fishery. Inna di first place, di amount a butter, an Texel an Leyden cheese weh dem consume, look amazing. Mi impute it, though, to dem naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by di nature of dem vocation, an especially by dem pursuing dem game inna dem frigid Polar Seas, pan di very coasts a dat deh Esquimaux country weh di convivial natives dem pledge each other inna bumpers a train oil.</p>
<p>Di quantity a beer, too, is very big, 10,800 barrels. Now, as dem polar fisheries deh coulda only be prosecuted inna di short summer a dat deh climate, so dat di whole cruise a one a dem Dutch whalemen, including di short voyage to an fram di Spitzbergen sea, neva much exceed three months, say, an reckoning 30 man to each a dem fleet a 180 sail, we have 50,00 Dutch seamen in all; so, mi seh, wi have precisely two barrels a beer fi each man, fi a twelve weeks' allowance, exclusive a him fair proportion a dat deh 550 ankers a gin. Now, weda dem gin an beer harpooneers yah, so fuddled as one might fancy dem to have been, was di right sort a man fi stan up inna a boat's head, an tek good aim at flying whales; dis woulda seem somewhat improbable. Yet dem did aim at dem, an hit dem too. But dis was very far North, be it remembered, weh beer agree well wid di constitution; pan di Equator, inna wi southern fishery, beer woulda be apt fi mek di harpooneer sleepy at di mast-head an boozy inna him boat; an grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket an New Bedford.</p>
<p>But no more; dem seh enough fi show seh di ole Dutch whalers dem a two or three centuries ago was high livers; an dat di English whalers dem neva neglect so excellent an example. For, dem seh, wen yuh a cruise inna an empty ship, if yuh cyaan get notn beta outa di worl, get a good dinner outa it, at least. An dis empty di decanter.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00108">CHAPTER 102. A Bower inna di Arsacides.</h2>
<p>Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, mi have chiefly dwelt upon di marvels a him outer aspect; or separately an in detail upon some few interior structural features. But to a large an thorough sweeping comprehension a him, it behooves mi now fi unbutton him still further, an untagging di points a him hose, unbuckling him garters, an casting loose di hooks an di eyes a di joints a him innermost bones, set him before yuh inna him ultimatum; dat mean, inna him unconditional skeleton.</p>
<p>But how now, Ishmael? How it is, dat yuh, a mere oarsman inna di fishery, pretend fi know aught bout di subterranean parts a di whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon yuh capstan, did deliver lectures pan di anatomy a di Cetacea; an by help a di windlass, hold up a specimen rib fi exhibition? Explain yuhself, Ishmael. Yuh can land a full-grown whale pan yuh deck fi examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. Yuh a one veritable witness so far, Ishmael; but tek a care how yuh seize di privilege a Jonah alone; di privilege fi discourse pan di joists an beams; di rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, an under-pinnings, mek op di frame-work a leviathan; an laik di tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, an cheeseries inna him bowels.</p>
<p>Mi confess, dat since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far beath di skin a di adult whale; nevertheless, mi have been blessed wid an opportunity fi dissect him inna miniature. Inna one ship weh mi did belong to, a likkle cub Sperm Whale did once bodyly hoisted to di deck fi him poke or bag, fi mek sheaths fi di barbs a di harpoons, an fi di heads a di lances. Yuh tink mi mek dat deh chance go, widout using mi boat-hatchet an jack-knife, an break di seal an read all di contents a dat deh young cub?</p>
<p>An as fi mi exact knowledge a di bones a di leviathan inna dem gigantic, full grown development, fi dat deh rare knowledge mi debt to mi late royal fren Tranquo, king a Tranque, one a di Arsacides. Fi deh a Tranque, years ago, wen mi did attached to di trading-ship Dey of Algiers, mi did get invite fi spen part a di Arsacidean holidays wid di lord a Tranque, a him retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant fram weh wi sailors dem did call Bamboo-Town, him capital.</p>
<p>Among plenty ada fine qualities, mi royal fren Tranquo, being gifted wid a devout love fi all matters a barbaric vertu, did bring tugeda inna Pupella whatever rare tings di more ingenious a him people coulda invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; an all dem deh distributed among whatever natural wonders, di wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves did cast pan him shores.</p>
<p>Chief among dem latter deh was a great Sperm Whale, weh, afta a unusually long raging gale, did get find dead an stranded, wid him head gens a cocoa-nut tree, weh him plumage-like, tufted droopings did look like him verdant jet. Wen di vast body did at last get stripped a it fathom-deep enfoldings, an di bones dem did become dust dry inna di sun, den di skeleton did carefully transport up di Pupella glen, weh a grand temple a lordly palms now sheltered it.</p>
<p>Di ribs dem did hang wid trophies; di vertebræ dem did carve wid Arsacidean annals, inna strange hieroglyphics; inna di skull, di priests dem keep up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so dat di mystic head again sen out it vapory spout; while, suspended fram a bough, di terrific lower jaw vibrate ova all di devotees, like di hair-hung sword weh so affrighted Damocles.</p>
<p>A did a wonderous sight. Di wood did green as mosses a di Icy Glen; di trees dem did a stan op high an haughty, a feel dem living sap; di industrious earth anda it was as a weaver's loom, wid a gorgeous carpet pan it, whichof di ground-vine tendrils form di warp an woof, an di living flowers di figures. All di trees, wid all dem laden branch dem; all di shrubs, an ferns, an grasses; di message-carrying air; all dem unceasingly did active. Thru di lacings a di leaves, di great sun did look like a flying shuttle weaving di unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—one word!—weh di fabric flow? weh palace it may deck? why all dem ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!—stay thy han!—but one single word wid yuh! Nay—di shuttle fly—di figures float fram forth di loom; di freshet-rushing carpet fi eva slide weh. Di weaver-god, him weave; an by dat deh weaving him get deaf, so him hear no mortal voice; an by dat deh humming, wi, too, weh look pan di loom get deaf; an only wen we escape it wi ago hear di thousand voices dem weh a speak through it. Fi even so it deh inna all material factories. Di wod dem weh yuh seh weh yuh no hear mongst di flying spindles dem; dem same words deh plainly hear widout di walls, bursting fram di opened casements. Dem deh detect villainies. Ah, mortal! den, be heedful; fi so, inna all dis din a di great world's loom, yuh subtlest tinkins maita be overheard afar.</p>
<p>Now, mid di green, life-restless loom a dat deh Arsacidean wood, di great, white, worshiped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet, as di ever-woven verdant warp an woof intermix an hum roun him, di mighty idler did look like di cunning weaver; himself all woven ova wid di vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself a skeleton. Life fold Death; Death trellised Life; di grim god wived wid youthful Life, an begat him curly-headed glories.</p>
<p>Now, wen wid royal Tranquo mi visit dis wondrous whale, an si di skull an altar, an di artificial smoke a ascend fram weh di real jet did issue, mi marvel seh di king shuda regard a chapel as an object a vertu. Im laugh. But more mi did a wanda seh di priest dem shuda swear seh smoky jet a him was genuine. Tu an fro mi pace before dis skeleton—brush di vines aside—broke thru di ribs—an wid a ball a Arsacidean twine, wander, eddied long amid it many winding, shaded colonnades an arbours. But soon mi line did out; an following it back, mi come out a di opening weh mi did enter. Mi neva si no living ting inside; notn neva deh deh but bones.</p>
<p>Cutting mi a green measuring-rod, mi once more dive widin di skeleton. Fram dem arrow-slit inna di skull, di priests dem si mi a tek di altitude a di final rib, “How now!” dem shout; “Dar's yuh measure dis fi wi god! Dat a fi wi.” “Aye, priests—well, how long yuh mek him, den?” But afta dat, a fierce contest comese mongst dem, bout feet an inches; dem crack each other's sconces wid dem yard-sticks—di great skull echo—an sizing dat deh lucky chance, mi quickly conclude mi own admeasurements.</p>
<p>Dem admeasurements yah mi a go set inna unu. But fos, mek it record, seh, inna dis matter, mi no free fi utter no fancied measurement mi please. Bikaaz yuh can refer to skeleton authorities, fi test mi accuracy. Deh have a Leviathanic Museum, dem tell mi, inna Hull, England, one a di whaling ports a dat deh country, weh dem have some fine specimens a fin-backs an other whales. Likewise, mi hear seh inna di museum a Manchester, inna New Hampshire, dem have weh di proprietors dem call “di only perfect specimen a one Greenland or River Whale inna di United States.” Moreover, at a place inna Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable have inna him possession di skeleton a one Sperm Whale, but a moderate size, by no means a di full-grown magnitude a mi fren King Tranquo's.</p>
<p>Inna di two cases, di stranded whales dem weh dem two skeleton yah did belong to, did originally claim by dem proprietors pan similar grounds. King Tranquo did a tek weh him cause him did waan it; an Sir Clifford, cause him was lord a di seignories a dem part deh. Sir Clifford's whale have been articulated throughout; so dat, like a great chest a drawers, yuh can open an shet him, inna all him bony cavities—spread out him ribs like a gigantic fan—an swing all day pan him lower jaw. Locks fi put pan some a him trap-doors an shutters; an a footman ago show round future visitors wid a bunch a keys at him side. Sir Clifford tink bout charging twopence fi a peep at di whispering gallery inna di spinal column; threepence fi hear di echo inna di hollow a him cerebellum; an sixpence fi di unrivaled view fram him forehead.</p>
<p>Di skeleton dimensions dem weh mi a go set dung now a copy verbatim fram mi right arm, weh mi did have dem tattoo; as inna mi wild wanderings at dat deh period, deh neva have no ada secure way fi preserve such valuable statistics. But as mi did crowded fi space, an wish di ada parts a mi body fi remain a blank page fi a poem weh mi did a compose den—at least, weh untatatoed parts mighta remain—mi neva trouble miself wid di odd inches; nor, indeed, shuda inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of di whale.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00109">CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton.</h2>
<p>Inna di first place, mi wish fi lay before yuh a particular, plain statement, touching di living bulk a dis leviathan, whose skeleton wi a go exhibit briefly. Such a statement maita prove useful yah.</p>
<p>According to a careful calculation mi mek, an weh mi partly base pan Captain Scoresby's estimate, a seventy tons fi di largest sized Greenland whale a sixty feet in length; according to mi careful calculation, mi seh, a Sperm Whale a di largest magnitude, between eighty-five an ninety feet in length, an someting less dan forty feet inna it fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so dat, reckoning thirteen man to a ton, him woulda considerably outweigh di combined population a one whole village a one thousand an hundred inhabitants.</p>
<p>Yuh no tink den seh brains, like yoked cattle, shuda put to dis leviathan, fi mek him at all budge to any landsman's imagination?</p>
<p>Afta mi don inna difrent wie put infronta yuh him skull, spout-hole, jaw, teet, tail, forehead, fins, an divers ada paats, mi ago now simply point out weh is most interesting inna di general bulk a him unobstructed bones. But as di colossal skull embrace so very large a proportion a di entire extent a di skeleton; as it is by far di most complicated part; an as nutten no fi repeat concerning it inna dis chapter, yuh no fi fail fi carry it inna yuh mind, or unda yuh arm, as we proceed, otherwise yuh naa go gain a complete notion a di general structure we a bout fi view.</p>
<p>In length, di Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque did measure seventy-two feet; so dat wen him fully invest an extended inna life, him mus been ninety feet long; fi inna di whale, di skeleton lose bout one fifth inna length compared wid di living body. Outa dis seventy-two feet, him skull an jaw comprise some twenty feet, lef some fifty feet a plain back-bone. Attached to dis back-bone, fi someting less dan a third a it length, was di mighty circular basket a ribs weh once enclosed him vitals.</p>
<p>Fi mi dis big ivory-ribbed chest, wid di lang, unrelieved spine, weh exten far weh fram it inna a straight line, not a likkle resembled di hull a wan big ship weh did new-laid pan di stocks, wen ongl som twenty a har naked bow-ribs dem insert, an di keel deh adawiez, fi di taim, bot a lang, disconcted timber.</p>
<p>Di ribs dem did deh pan a side. Di fos wan, fi staat fram di nek, did nier siks fut lang; di secan, third, an fourth did each successively longer, til yuh come to di climax a di fifth, or one a di middle ribs, weh did measure eight feet an some inches. Fram dat deh part, di remaining ribs diminished, til di tenth an last only span five feet an some inches. In general thickness, dem all bore a seemly correspondence to dem length. Di middle ribs dem was di most arched. Inna some a di Arsacides dem use dem fi beams weh yuh lay footpath bridges ova likkle streams.</p>
<p>Wen mi did a consider dem ribs yah, mi couldn't but be struck anew wid di circumstance, so variously repeated inna dis book, dat di skeleton a di whale is by no means di mold a him invested form. Di largest a di Tranque ribs, one a di middle ones, did a occupied dat deh part a di fish weh, inna life, is greatest inna depth. Now, di greatest depth a di invested body a dis particular whale mus been at least sixteen feet; whereas, di corresponding rib measure but likkle more dan eight feet. So dat dis rib only conveyed half a di true notion a di living magnitude a dat deh part. Besides, fi some way, weh mi now si but a naked spine, all weh did once wrap roun wid tons a added bulk inna flesh, muscle, blood, an bowels. Stil more, fi di ample fins, mi yah si but a few disordered joints; an in place a di weighty an majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!</p>
<p>How vain an foolish, den, mi did tink, fi timid untravelled man fi try fi andastan aright dis wondrous whale, by merely poring ova him dead attenuated skeleton, stretch inna dis peaceful wood. No. Only inna di heart a quickest perils; only wen widin di eddyings a him angry flukes; only pan di profound unbounded sea, can di fully invested whale be truly an livingly found out.</p>
<p>But di spine. Fi dat, di bes way wi can consider it is, wid a crane, fi pile it bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it don, it look much like Pompey's Pillar.</p>
<p>Deh have forty an odd vertebræ inna all, weh inna di skeleton no lock tugeda. Dem mostly lie like di great knobbed blocks pan a Gothic spire, forming solid courses a heavy masonry. Di largest one, a middle one, is inna width someting less dan three feet, an inna depth more dan four. Di smallest, weh di spine tapers weh inna di tail, is only two inches in width, an look someting like a white billiard-ball. Dem did tell mi seh dem did still have smaller ones, but dem did lost by some likkle cannibal urchins, di priest's pickney dem, weh did steal dem fi play marbles wid. So wi si how dat di spine a even di hugest a living tings taper off at last into simple child's play.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00110">CHAPTER 104. Di Fossil Whale.</h2>
<p>Fram him mighty bulk di whale afford a most congenial theme weh yuh can enlarge, amplify, an generally expatiate. Yuh woulda, yuh couldn't compress him. By good rights him shuda only get treat inna imperial folio. Not fi tell ova again him furlongs fram spiracle to tail, an di yards him measure bout di waist; only tink bout di gigantic involutions a him intestines, weh dem lay inna him like great cables an hawsers coiled weh inna di subterranean orlop-deck a one line-of-battle-ship.</p>
<p>Since mi don undertake fi manhandle dis Leviathan, it behooves mi fi approve miself omnisciently exhaustive inna di enterprise; not overlooking di minutest seminal germs a him blood, an spinning him out to di uttermost coil a him bowels. Afta im don diskraib im ina muos a im present habitatory an anatomical peculiarities, it now lef fi magnify im inna wan archæological, fossiliferous, an antediluvian point a view. Applied to any ada creature dan di Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But wen Leviathan a di text, di case get alter. Fain am fi stagger to dis eprise unda di weightiest words a di dictionary. An yahso be it seh, dat weneva it been convenient fi consult one inna di course a demya dissertations, mi have invariably use a huge quarto edition a Johnson, expressly purchase fi dat purpose; bikaa dat deh famous lexicographer's uncommon personal bulk more fit him fi compile a lexicon fi use by a whale author like mi.</p>
<p>Yuh often hear bout writers weh rise an swell wid dem subject, though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, den, wid mi, writing bout dis Leviathan? Unconsciously mi chirography expand into placard capitals. Gi mi a condor's quill! Gi mi Vesuvius' crater fi an inkstand! Fren dem, hold mi arms! For inna di mere act a penning mi thoughts a dis Leviathan, dem weary mi, an mek mi faint wid dem outreaching comprehensiveness a sweep, as if fi include di whole circle a di sciences, an all di generations a whales, an man, an mastodons, past, present, an to come, wid all di revolving empire panoramas pan di earth, an not whole universe excluding its suburbs. Such, an so magnifying, is di virtue a one big an liberal theme! Wi expand to its bulk. Fi produce a mighty book, yuh haffi choose a mighty theme. No great an enduring volume can eva be write pan di flea, though plenty a dem deh weh try it.</p>
<p>Bifuo mi did a go pan di subject a Fossil Whales, mi did a present mi credentials as a geologist, by stating dat inna mi miscellaneous time mi did a stone-mason, an also a great digger a ditches, canals an wells, wine-vaults, cellars, an cisterns a all sorts. Likewise, by way a preliminary, mi desire fi remind di reader, seh while inna di earlier geological strata dem find di fossils a monsters now almost completely extinct; di sobsequent relics dem weh dem discover inna weh dem call di Tertiary formations seem di connecting, or at any rate intercepted links, between di antichronical creatures, an dem whose remote posterity dem seh dem did enter di Ark; all di Fossil Whales weh dem did discover so hitherto belong to di Tertiary period, weh a di last weh did deh before di superficial formations. An though none a dem precisely ansa to any known species of di present time, dem still sufficiently akin to dem in general respects, fi justify dem taking rank as Cetacean fossils.</p>
<p>Detached broken fossils a pre-adamite whales, fragments a dem bones an skeletons, have widin thirty years past, at various intervals, been found at di base a di Alps, inna Lombardy, inna France, inna England, inna Scotland, an inna di States a Louisiana, Mississippi, an Alabama. Among di more curious a such remains is part a one skull, weh inna di year 1779 did disinterred inna di Rue Dauphine inna Paris, a shaat street opening almost directly upon di palace a di Tuileries; an bones disinterred inna excavating di great docks a Antwerp, inna Napoleon's time. Cuvier pronounce dem fragment yah belong to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species.</p>
<p>But by far di most wonderful a all Cetacean relics was di almost complete vast skeleton a one extinct monster, weh dem did find inna di year 1842, pan di plantation a Judge Creagh, inna Alabama. Di awe-stricken credulous slaves inna di vicinity tek it fi di bones a one a di fallen angels. Di Alabama doctors dem declare it a huge reptile, an gi it di name a Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones a it weh dem tek across di sea to Owen, di English Anatomis, it turn out seh dis alleged reptile was a whale, though a one departed species. A significant illustration a di fact, again an again repeated inna dis book, dat di skeleton a di whale furnish but likkle clue to di shape a him fully invested body. So Owen rechristene di monster Zeuglodon; an inna him paper weh him did read before di London Geological Society, him pronounce it, inna substance, one a di most extraordinary creatures weh di mutations a di globe did blot out a existence.</p>
<p>Wen mi stan mongst dem mighty Leviathan skeleton, skull, tusks, jaws, ribs, an vertebræ, all characterized by partial resemblances to di existing breeds a sea-monsters; but at di same time bearing pan di ada han similar affinities to di annihilated antichronical Leviathans, dem incalculable seniors; Mi is, by a flood, borne back to dat deh wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have began; kaa taim staat wid man. Yahso Saturn's gray chaos roll ova mi, an mi get dim, shuddering glimpses inna dem Polar eternities; wen wedged bastions a ice press hard pan weh a now di Tropics; an inna all di 25,000 miles a dis world's circumference, not a inhabitable hand's breadth a lan was visible. Den di whole worl was di whale's; an, king a creation, him lef him wake along di present lines a di Andes an di Himmalehs. A who can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab's harpoon did shed older blood dan di Pharaoh's. Methuselah look like a school-boy. Mi look roun fi shake han wid Shem. Mi horror-struck at dis antemosaic, unsourced existence a di unspeakable terrors a di whale, weh, having been before all time, must needs exist afta all humane ages don.</p>
<p>But not alone dis Leviathan lef him pre-adamite traces inna di stereotype plates a nature, an inna limestone an marl bequeat him ancient bust; but pan Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems fi claim fi dem an almost fossiliferous character, we find di unmistakable print a him fin. Inna one apartment a di great temple a Denderah, some fifty years ago, dem did discover pan di granite ceiling a sculptured an painted planisphere, abunding in centaurs, griffins, an dolphins, similar to di grotesque figures pan di celestial globe a di moderns. Gliding mongst dem, old Leviathan swim as of yore; did deh deh swimming inna dat deh planisphere, centuries before Solomon did cradled.</p>
<p>Nor must be omitted anodda strange attestation a di antiquity a di whale, inna him own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set dung by di venerable John Leo, di old Barbary traveller.</p>
<p>“Not far fram di Sea-side, dem have a Temple, di Rafters an Beams dem mek outa Whale-Bones; cause Whales a one monstrous size dem oftentimes cast up dead pan dat deh shore. Di Common People dem imagine, seh by a secret Power weh God gi di Temple, no Whale can pass it widout immediate death But, dat deh pan di Matter. either side a di Temple, deh deh Rocks weh shoot two Miles inna di Sea, an wound di Whales wen dem light pan 'em. Dem keep a Whale's Rib a one incredible length fi a Miracle, weh lay pan di Ground wid it convex part uppermost, mek a Arch, di Head a which cyaan reach pan a Man Back. (say John Leo) dem seh him did layn deh a hundred Years before mi si it. Dem Historians affirm, seh a Prophet weh did a prophesy'd bout Mahomet, did come fram dis Temple, an some nuh stan fi assert, seh di Prophet Jonas did get cast out by di Whale at di Base a di Temple.”</p>
<p>Inna dis Afric Temple of the Whale mi lef yuh, reader, an if yuh a Nantucketer, an a whaleman, yuh wi silently worship deh.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00111">CHAPTER 105. Di Whale's Magnitude Diminish?—Wil Him Perish?</h2>
<p>Inasmuch, den, as dis Leviathan come floundering dung pan wi fram di head-waters a di Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, weda, inna di lang course a him generations, him neva degenerate fram di original bulk a him sires.</p>
<p>But pan investigation wi find out, seh not only di whales dem a di present day superior inna magnitude to dem whose fossil remains dem deh inna di Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but a di whales dem weh dem find inna dat deh Tertiary system, dem weh belong to its latter formations exceed inna size dem a it earlier ones.</p>
<p>Outa all di pre-adamite whales dem weh get exhum yet, by far di largest a di Alabama one weh dem mention inna di last chapter, an dat was less dan seventy feet in length inna di skeleton. Whereas, wi don si aredi, seh di tape-measure gi seventy-two feet fi di skeleton a one big sized modern whale. An mi hear, pan whalemen's authority, seh Sperm Whales did get capture near a hundred feet long at di time dem did capture dem.</p>
<p>But mek it not be, dat while di whales dem a di present hour a one advance inna magnitude upon dem a all previous geological periods; may it not be, dat since Adam's time dem degenerate?</p>
<p>Assuredly, wi haffi conclude so, if wi a fi credit di accounts a such gentlemen as Pliny, an di ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tell wi bout whales weh did embrace acres a living bulk, an Aldrovandus bout ada ones weh did measure eight hundred feet in length—Rope Walks an Thames Tunnels of Whales! An even inna di days a Banks an Solander, Cooke's naturalists, wi find a Danish memba a di Academy of Sciences a set dong certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred an twenty yards; dat mean, three hundred an sixty feet. An Lacépède, di French naturalist, inna him elaborate history a whales, inna di very beginning a him work (page 3), set dung di Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred an twenty-eight feet. An dis work did publish so late as AD 1825.</p>
<p>But any whaleman ago believe dem stories yah? No. Di whale a to-day is as big as him ancestors inna Pliny's time. An if eva mi go weh Pliny deh, mi, a whaleman (muor dan him was), wi mek bold fi tell him so. Bikaaz mi cyan andastan how it go, dat while di Egyptian mummies dem weh did beri thousands a years before even Pliny did born, no measure so much inna dem coffins as a modern Kentuckian inna him socks; an while di cattle an ada animal dem weh dem sculpture pan di oldest Egyptian an Nineveh tablets, by di relative proportions in which dem draw, jus as plainly prove seh di high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle a Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude di fattest a Pharaoh's fat kite; inna di face a all dis, mi naa go admit seh a all animals di whale alone shuda did degenerate.</p>
<p>But still anodda inquiry remains; one often agitated by di more recondite Nantucketers. Weda owing to di almost omniscient look-outs at di mast-heads a di whale-ships, now penetrating even through Behring's straits, an into di remotest secret drawers an lockers a di worl; an di thousand harpoons an lances dem did a darted along all continental coasts; di moot point is, weda Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase, an so remorseless a havoc; weda him nuh at last get exterminate fram di waters, an di last whale, like di last man, smoke him last pipe, an den himself evaporate inna di final puff.</p>
<p>Wen yuh compare di humped herds a whales wid di humped herds a buffalo, weh, not forty years ago, did overspread by tens a thousands di prairies a Illinois an Missouri, an did a shake dem iron manes an a scowl wid dem thunder-clotted brows pan di sites a di populous river-capitals, weh di polite broker now a sell a dollars inch; inna such a comparison an irresistible argument woulda seem furnished, fi show seh di hunted whale cyaan now escape speedy extinction.</p>
<p>But yuh haffi look pon dis mata inna every light. Though so short a period ago—not a good lifetime—di census a di buffalo inna Illinois did exceed di census a man dem now inna London, an though at di present day not one horn or hoof a dem remain inna all dat deh region; an though di cause a dis wondrous extermination was di spear a man; yet di far different nature a di whale-hunt peremptorily forbid so inglorious an end to di Leviathan. Forty man inna one ship weh a hunt di Sperm Whales fi forty-eight months tink dem don do extremely well, an tank God, if at last dem carry home di oil a forty fish. Whereas, inna di days a di old Canadian an Indian hunters an trappers a di West, wen di far west (in which sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness an a virgin, di same numba a moccasined man, fi di same numba a months, mount pan horse instead a sailing inna ships, woulda slain not not forty, but forty an more buffouses; a fact dat, if need was, coulda be statistically stated.</p>
<p>Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, fi example, dat in former years (di latter part a di last century, say) dem Leviathans, inna small pods, did encounter much oftener dan at present, an, in consequence, di voyages dem neva so prolonged, an dem did also remunerative much more. Bikaaz, az wi did si elswe, dem de whale, weh get influens bai som views tu safety, now swim di seas inna immense caravans, so dat tu a big degree di scattered solitary, yokes, an pods, an schools a ada days dem now aggregate inna vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies. Dat a all. An equally fallacious seems di conceit, dat because di so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds inna former years abunding wid dem, hence dat species also a decline. For dem only a get drive fram promontory to cape; an if one coast no longer enlivened wid dem jets, den, be sure, some other an remoter strand have been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.</p>
<p>Furthermore: concerning dem last mentioned Leviathans, dem have two firm fortresses, weh, in all human probability, will fi ever remain impregnable. An as upon di invasion a dem valleys, di frosty Swiss dem retreat to dem mountains; so, hunted fram di savannas an glades a di middle seas, di whale-bone whales can at last resort to dem Polar citadels, an diving unda di ultimate glassy barriers an walls deh, come up among icy fields an floes; an inna a charmed circle a everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit fram man.</p>
<p>But as perhaps fifty a dem whale-bone whales deh get harpooned fi one cachalot, some philosophers a di forecastle don conclude seh dis positive havoc don already very seriously diminished dem battalions. But though fi some time past a nomba a dem whales yah, not less dan 13,000, did get kill every year pan di nor' west coast by di Americans dem alone; yet deh have considerations weh render even dis circumstance a likkle or no account as an opposing argument inna dis matter.</p>
<p>Natural as it is fi be somewhat incredulous concerning di populousness a di more enormous creatures a di globe, yet weh wi fi seh to Harto, di historian a Goa, wen him tell wi seh at one hunting di King a Siam tek 4,000 elephants; dat inna dem deh regions elephants dem nuff as droves a cattle inna di temperate climes. An it look like no reason fi doubt seh if dem elephant yah, weh dem did a hunt fi thousands a years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, an by all di successive monarchs dem a di East—if dem still survive deh inna great numba, much more may di great whale outlast all hunting, since him have a pasture fi expatiate inna, both times as large, Asias Yuurop ah Afrika, Nyuu Alan, ah aal di Ailan a di sii jainop.</p>
<p>Moreover: wi haffi consider, dat fram di presumed great longevity a whales, dem probably attaining di age a one century an more, so at any one period a time, several distinct adult generations haffi be contemporary. An weh dat mean, wi maita suun get som aidiya a, bai imajin aal a di griev-yaad dem, semitri dem, an fambili vault dem a krieshan we gi op di laif badi dem a aal a di man dem, uman dem, an pikni dem we did alaiv sevnti-faiv ier ago; an adding dis countless host to di present human population a di globe.</p>
<p>So, fi all dem ting deh, wi account di whale immortal inna him species, however perishable inna him individuality. Him swim di seas dem before di continents dem break water; him did swim ova di site a di Tuileries, an Windsor Castle, an di Kremlin. Inna Noah flood him did disrispek Noah's Ark; an if eva di worl a go flod agen, laik di Netherlands, fi kil aaf dem rat dem, den di eternal whale wi stil sorvaiv, an rearing pan di topmost crest a di equatorial flood, spout im frothed defiance tu di skai.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00112">CHAPTER 106. Ahab's Leg.</h2>
<p>Di precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab did quit di Samuel Enderby of London, neva did unattended wid some likkle violence to him own person. Im did light wid such energy pan a thwart a im boat dat im ivory leg did get a half-splintering shock. An wen afta him get him own deck, an him own pivot-hole deh, him so vehemently wheel round wid an urgent command to di steersman (it was, as ever, someting bout him not steering inflexibly enough); den, di already shaken ivory get such an additional twist an wrench, dat though it still remain entire, an to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab neva deem it entirely trustworthy.</p>
<p>An, indeed, it did look like a likl ting fi wonder, dat fi all him pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to di condition a dat deh dead bone weh him partly did a stan op pan. For it neva been very long before di Pequod's sailing fram Nantucket, dem did find him one night lidong prone pan di grong, an insensible; by some unknown, an seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, him ivory limb did so violently displace, dat it did stake-wise smitten, an all but pierced him groin; nor was it widout extreme difficulty dat di agonizing wound did entirely cure.</p>
<p>Nor, at di time, it did fail fi enter him monomaniac mind, dat all di anguish a dat deh den present suffering was but di direct issue a one former woe; an him too plainly seemed fi see, dat as di most poisonous reptile a di marsh perpetuates him kind as inevitably as di sweetest songster a di grove; so, equally wid every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget dem like. Yee, more dan equally, did tink Ahab; since both di ancestry an posterity a Grief go further dan di ancestry an posterity a Joy. For, not fi hint a dis: dat it a one inference fram certain canonic teachings, dat while some natural enjoyments yah shall have no children born to dem fi di other world, but, pan di contrary, shall be followed by di joy-childlessness a all hell's despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to demself an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all fi hint a dis, it still look like an inequality inna di deeper analysis a di ting. For, did tink Ahab, while even di highest earthly felicities eva have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking inna dem, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, an, inna some man, an archangelic grandeur; so do dem diligent tracings-out not belie di obvious deduction. Fi trail di genealogies a dem high mortal miseries, carry wi at last mongst di sourceless primogenitures a di gods; so dat, inna di face a all di glad, hay-making suns, an soft cymballing, round harvest-moons, wi haffi needs give in to dis: dat di gods demself nuh glad fi eva. Di ineffaceable, sad birth-mark inna di brow a man, a jus di stamp a sorrow inna di signers.</p>
<p>Unwittingly yah a secret did get divulged, weh perhaps might more properly, in set way, did get disclose before. Wid plenty ada particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why it was, dat fi a certain period, both before an afta di sailing of di Pequod, him did hide himself weh wid such Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; an, fi dat deh one interval, dem did a look fi speechless refuge, as it did deh, mongst di marble senate a di dead. Captain Peleg's bruited reason fi dis ting did look by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab's deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant darkness dan of explanatory light. But, inna di end, it all come out; dis one matter did, at least. Dat de direful mishap did deh a di bottom a him temporary recluseness. An not only dis, but to dat deh ever-contracting, dropping circle shore, who, fi any reason, possessed di privilege of a less banned approach to him; to dat deh timid circle di above hinted casualty—remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested itself wid terrors, not entirely underived fram di lan a spirits an a wails. So dat, chruu dem zeal fi him, dem did all conspire, so far as inna dem lay, fi muffle up di knowledge a dis ting fram others; an hence it was, dat not til a considerable interval did elapsed, did it transpire upon di Pequod's decks.</p>
<p>But be all dis as it may; mek di unseen, ambiguous synod inna di air, or di vindictive princes an potentates a fire, have fi do or not wid earthly Ahab, yet, inna dis present matter a him leg, him tek plain practical procedures;—im call di carpenter.</p>
<p>An wen dat deh functionary appear before him, him bade him widout delay set bout fi mek a new leg, an direct di mates fi see him supplied wid all di studs an joists a jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) weh did thus far been accumulated pan di voyage, in order dat a careful selection a di stoutest, clearest-grained might be secured. Dis done, di carpenter get order fi have di leg completed dat deh night; an fi provide all di fittings fi it, independent a dem pertaining to di distrusted one in use. Moreover, di ship's forge did get order fi be hoist outa it temporary idleness inna di hold; an, fi accelerate di affair, di blacksmith did get command fi proceed at once to di forging a whatever iron contrivances might be needed.</p>
