<h2 id="pgepubid00099">CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze a di Hand.</h2>
<p>Dat deh whale a Stubb's, so dearly purchase, did duly bring to di Pequod's side, weh all dem cutting an hoisting operations weh did detailed before, did regularly gone through, even to di baling a di Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.</p>
<p>While some did a occupied wid dis latter duty, others did a employ fi drag weh di larger tubs, so soon as dem did full wid di sperm; an wen di proper time arrive, dis same sperm did carefully manipulate ere going to di try-works, of which anon.</p>
<p>It did cool an crystallize to such a degree, dat wen, wid several others, mi did a sidong before a big Constantine's bath a it, mi find it strangely concreted inna lumps, yah an deh a roll bout inna di liquid part. A did wi business fi squeeze dem lumps back inna fluid. A sweet an unctuous duty! No wanda seh inna old times dis sperm was such a favorite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious molifier! Afta mi have mi han dem inna it fi only a few minutes, mi finga dem did feel like eels, an staat, as it were, fi serpentine an spiralise.</p>
<p>As mi did a sidong deh at mi ease, cross-legged pan di deck; afta di bitter exertion at di windlass; anda a blue tranquil sky; di ship anda indolent sail, an gliding so serenely along; as mi bath mi han dem mongst dem soft, gentle globules a infiltrated tissues, woven almost widin di hour; as dem richly break to mi fingers, an discharge all dem opulence, like fully ripe grapes dem wine; as mi snuff up dat deh uncontaminated aroma,—literally an truly, like di smell a spring violets; Mi a tel yuh, seh fi di time mi did a live inna a musky meadow; Mi forget all bout wi horrible oath; inna dat inexpressible sperm, mi wash mi han dem an mi heart a it; Mi almost staat fi credit di old Paracelsan superstition seh sperm is a rare virtue inna allaying di heat a anger; while mi did a bath inna dat deh bath, mi did feel divinely free fram all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, a any sort whatsoever.</p>
<p>Kweez! kweez! kweez! all di morning long; Mi squeeze dat deh sperm til mi self almost melt inna it; Mi squeeze dat deh sperm til a strange sort a insanity come ova mi; an mi find miself unwittingly squeeze mi co-laborers's hands inna it, mistaking dem hands fi di gentle globules. Such an abunding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did dis avocation beget; dat at last mi did a continually squeeze dem hands, an look up inna dem eyes sentimentally; as much as fi seh,—Oh! mi dear fellow beings, why we shuda longer cherish any social acerbities, or know di slightest ill-humor or envy! Cum; mek wi squeeze han dem all round; nay, mek wi all squeeze wiself inna each ada; mek wi squeeze wiself universally inna di very milk an sperm a kindness.</p>
<p>Wuda dat mi coulda keep squeeze dat deh sperm fi eva! Fi now, since by many prolonged, repeated experiences, mi have perceived dat in all cases man haffi eventually lower, or at least shift, him conceit of attainable felicity; no put it noweh inna di intellect or di fancy; but inna di wife, di heart, di bed, di table, di saddle, di fireside, di country; now dat mi don perceive all a dis, mi ready fi squeeze case eternally. In thoughts a di visions a di night, mi si long rows a angels inna paradise, each wid dem han dem inna a jar a spermaceti.</p>
<p>Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves fi speak bout other tings akin to it, inna di business a preparing di sperm whale fi di try-works.</p>
<p>Fos come white-horse, so called, weh dem get fram di tapering part a di fish, an also fram di thicker portions a him flukes. It tough wid congealed tendons—a wad a muscle—but still contain some oil. Afta dem tek weh di whale, dem fos cut di white-horse inna portable oblongs ere go to di mincer. Dem look much like blocks a Berkshire marble.</p>
<p>Plum-pudding a di term weh dem use pan certain fragmentary parts a di whale's flesh, yah an deh adhering to di blanket a blubber, an often participating to a considerable degree inna its unctuousness. A one most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object fi behold. As its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, wid a bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted wid spots of the deepest crimson and purple. A plums a rubies, inna pictures a citron. Spite a reason, it hard fi keep yuhself fram eat it. Mi confess, dat once mi did a steal behind di foremast fi try it. It did taste someting as mi shuda conceive a royal cutlet fram di thigh a Louis le Gros mighta did taste, supposing him did get kill di first day afta di venison season, an dat deh particular venison season contemporary wid an unusually fine vintage a di vineyards a Champagne.</p>
<p>Deh have anodda substance, an a very singular one, weh turn up inna di course a dis business, but weh mi feel it fi be very puzzling adequately fi describe. Dem call it slobgollion; an appellation original wid di whalemen, an even so is di nature a di substance. A one ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found inna di tubs a sperm, afta a prolonged squeezing, an subsequent decanting. Mi hold it fi be di wondrously thin, ruptured membranes a di case, coalescing.</p>
<p>Gurry, so called, a one term properly belonging to right whalemen, but sometimes incidentally used by di sperm fishermen. It designate di dark, glutinous substance weh dem scrape off di back a di Greenland or right whale, an much a weh cover di decks a dem inferior souls weh hunt dat deh ignoble Leviathan.</p>
<p>Nippers. Strictly dis word a nuh indigenous to di whale's vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it become so. A whaleman's nipper a one shaat firm strip a tendinous stuff weh dem cut fram di tapering part a Leviathan's tail: it average an inch inna thickness, an fi di rest, a bout di size a di iron part a one hoe. Edgewise moved along di oily deck, it operate like a leathern squilgee; an by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along wid it all impurities.</p>
<p>But fi laan all bout dem recondite matters yah, yuh bes way is at once fi descend inna di blubber-room, an have a long talk wid di inmates dem. Dis place did mention before as di receptacle fi di blanket-pieces, wen dem stript an hoist fram di whale. Wen di proper time arrive fi cut up di contents, dis apartment a one scene a terror fi all tyros, especially by night. Pan one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space lef clear fi di workmen dem. Dem generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman an a spade-man. Di whaling-pike is similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of di same name. Di gaff a someting like a boat-hook. Wid him gaff, di gaffman hook on to a sheet a blubber, an strive fi hold it fram slip, as di ship pitch an lurches bout. Meanwhile, di spade-man stan op pan di sheet itself, perpendicularly a chop it inna di portable horse-pieces. Dis spade shaap as hone can mek it; di spademan's foot dem shoeless; di ting weh him stan pan will sometimes irresistibly slide weh fram him, like a sledge. If him cut off one a him own toe, or one a him assistants', yuh woulda be very much astonized? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room man.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00100">CHAPTER 95. Di Cassock.</h2>
<p>If yuh did step pan di Pequod at a certain juncture a dis post-mortemizing a di whale; an if yuh did stroll forward nigh di windlass, pretty sure am mi seh yuh woulda scan wid no small curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, weh yuh woulda see deh, lying along lengthwise inna di lee scuppers. Not di wondrous cistern inna di whale's huge head; not di prodigy a him unhinged lower jaw; not di miracle a him symmetrical tail; none a dem woulda so surprise yuh, as half a glimpse a dat deh unaccountable cone,—longer dan a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at di base, an jet-black as Yojo, di ebony idol a Queequeg. An a idol, indeed, it is; or, radda, inna old times, it likeness was. Such an idol as dat weh dem find inna di secret groves a Queen Maachah inna Judea; an fi worship which, King Asa, har son, did depose har, an destroy di idol, an burn it fi an abomination at di brook Kedron, as darkly set out inna di 15th chapter a di First Book a Kings.</p>
<p>Look pan di sailor, weh dem call di mincer, weh now come along, an assisted by two allies, heavily back di grandissimus, as di mariners call it, an wid bowed shoulders, staggers off wid it as if him was a grenadier carrying a dead comrade fram di field. Extending it upon di forecastle deck, him now proceed cylindrical fi tek weh it dark pelt, as an African hunter di pelt a one boa. Dis done him turn di pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gi it a good stretching, so as almost fi double it diameter; an at last hang it, well spread, inna di rigging, fi dry. Ere long, it tek dung; wen him tek weh some three feet a it, towards di pointed extremity, an den cut two slits fi arm-holes at di ada end, him lengthwise slip himself bodyly inna it. Di mincer now stan up before yuh invest inna di full canonicals a him calling. Immemorial to all him order, dis investiture alone ago adequately protect him, while him employ inna di peculiar functions a him office.</p>
<p>Dat deh office consist inna mincing di horse-pieces a blubber fi di pots; an operation weh dem conduct at a curious wooden horse, plant endwise against di bulwarks, an wid a capacious tub beath it, into which di minced pieces drop, fast as di sheets fram a rapt orator's desk. Arrayed inna decent black; occupy a conspicuous pulpit; intent pan bible leaves; wat a candidate fi an archbishopric, what a lad fi a Pope was dis mincer!*</p>
<p>*Baibl lef! Bible leaves! Dis a di invariable cry fram di mates to di mincer. It enjoin him fi be careful, an cut him work inna as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing di business a boiling out di oil is much accelerated, an its quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00101">CHAPTER 96. Di Try-Works.</h2>
<p>Besides har hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by har try-works. Shi present di curious anomaly a di most solid masonry joining wid oak an hemp inna constituting di completed ship. A like fram di open field a brick-kiln did a transport to har planks.</p>
<p>Di try-works dem plant between di foremast an mainmast, di most roomy part a di deck. Di timbers dem unda it have a peculiar strength, fit fi sustain di weight a one almost solid mass a brick an mortar, some ten feet by eight square, an five in height. Di foundation no penetrate di deck, but di masonry dem firmly secure to di surface by ponderous knees a iron bracing it pan all sides, an screw it dung to di timbers. Pan di flanks it case wid wood, an at top completely cover by a large, sloping, battened hatchway. Wen wi tek weh dis hatch, wi expose di great try-pots, two inna numba, an each a di several barrels' capacity. Wen dem no inna use, dem keep dem remarkably clean. Somtaim dem polish dem wid soapstone an sand, til dem shine widin like silver punch-bowls. Durin di night-watches some cynical old sailors ago crawl inna dem an coil demself weh deh fi a nap. While employed in polishing dem—one man inna each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are carryed on, ova di iron lips. A one place fi profound mathematical meditation tu. A did inna di left han try-pot a di Pequod, wid di soapstone diligently circling roun mi, dat mi did fos indirectly struck by di remarkable fact, dat inna geometry all bodies gliding along di cycloid, mi soapstone fi example, ago descend fram any point inna precisely di same time.</p>
<p>Wen yuh tek weh di fire-board fram di front a di try-works, di bare masonry a dat deh side get expose, penetrated by di two iron mout a di furnaces, directly unda di pots. Dem mout deh fit wid heavy doors a iron. Di intense heat a di fire is prevent fram communicate itself to di deck, by means a a shallow reservoir extending unda di entire inclosed surface a di works. By a tunnel inserted at di rear, dis reservoir is keep replenished wid water as fast as it evaporate. No external chimneys nuh deh; dem open direct fram di rear wall. An yahso mek wi go back fi a moment.</p>
<p>A did bout nine o'clock at night dat di Pequod's try-works dem did fos staat pan dis present voyage. It belong to Stubb fi oversee di business.</p>
<p>“All ready deh? Off hatch, den, an staat har. Yuh cook, fire di works.” Dis was an easy ting, cause di carpenter did a thrust him shavings inna di furnace throughout di passage. Yahso be it seh dat inna a whaling voyage di first fire inna di try-works haffi be feed fi a time wid wood. Afta dat no wood no use, except as a means fi quick ignition to di staple fuel. In a word, afta dem try it out, di crisp, shriveled blubber, weh dem call scraps or fritters now, still contain considerable a it unctuous properties. Dem fritters deh feed di flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, di whale supply him own fuel an burn by him own body. Wuda dat him did a consume him own smoke! fi him smoke horrible fi inhale, an inhale it yuh haffi, an not only dat, but yuh haffi live inna it fi di time. It have a unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor bout it, such as may lurk inna di vicinity a funereal pyres. It smell like di left wing a di day a judgment; it a one argument fi di pit.</p>
<p>By midnight di works dem did inna full operation. Wi did clear fram di carcase; sail did mek; di wind did a freshene; di wild ocean darkness did intense. But dat deh darkness did lick up by di fierce flames, weh at intervals fork out fram di sooty flues, an illuminate every lofty rope inna di rigging, as wid di famed Greek fire. Di burning ship drive on, as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed. So di pitch an sulphur-freighted brigs a di bold Hydriote, Canaris, weh did a come fram dem midnight harbors, wid broad sheets a flame fi sails, bore dung pan di Turkish frigates, an fold dem inna conflagrations.</p>
<p>Di hatch, weh dem tek weh fram di top a di works, now afford a wide hearth inna front a dem. Standing pan dis was di Tartarean shapes a di pagan harpooneers, always di whale-ship's stokers. Wid huge pronged poles dem pitch hissing masses a blubber inna di scalding pots, or stir up di fires dem unda, til di snaky flames dem dart, curling, outa di doors fi catch dem by di feet. Di smoke roll weh inna sullen heaps. Tu every pitch a di ship deh did have a pitch a di boiling oil, weh did look like all eagerness fi leap inna dem face. Opposite di mout a di works, pan di further side a di wide wooden hearth, was di windlass. Dis did serve fi a sea-sofa. Yahso di watch did a lounge, wen dem neva did a work, a look inna di red heat a di fire, til dem eyes did a feel scorched inna dem head. Dem tawny features, now all begrimed wid smoke an sweat, dem matted beards, an di contrasting barbaric brilliancy a dem teet, all dem did strangely reveal inna di capricious emblazonings a di works. As dem did a narrate to each other dem unholy adventures, dem tales a terror did a tell dem inna words a mirth; as dem uncivilized laughter fork upwards outa dem, like di flames fram di furnace; as to an fro, inna dem front, di harpooneers wildly gesticulated wid dem huge pronged forks an dippers; as di wind did a howle on, an di sea did a leap, an di ship did a groan an dive, an yet steadfastly shot har red hell further an further inna di blackness a di sea an di night, an scornfully champ di white bone inna har mout, an viciously spat roun har pan all sides; den di rushing Pequod, freighted wid savages, an laden wid fire, an burning a corpse, an plunging inna dat deh blackness a darkness, seemed di material counterpart a har monomaniac commander's soul.</p>
<p>So it did feel to mi, as mi did a stan up a har helm, an fi long hours silently guide di way a dis fire-ship pan di sea. Wrap, fi dat deh interval, inna darkness miself, mi but di beta si di redness, di madness, di ghastliness a ada piipl. Di continual sight a di fiend shapes before mi, capering half inna smoke an half inna fire, dem at last begat kinred visions inna mi soul, so soon as mi staat fi yield to dat deh unaccountable drowsiness weh eva woulda come ova mi at a midnight helm.</p>
<p>But dat deh night, in particular, a strange (an ever since inexplicable) ting happen to mi. Startin fram a brief standing sleep, mi did horribly conscious a someting fatally wrong. Di jaw-bone tiller did a hit mi side, weh did a lean against it; inna mi ears was di low hum a sails, jus staatin fi shake inna di wind; Mi did tink seh mi eyes dem did open; Mi did half conscious a put mi finga dem to di lids an mechanically stretch dem still further apart. But, spite a all dis, mi couldn't see no compass before mi fi steer by; though it did look like a minute since mi did a watch di card, by di steady binnacle lamp weh did a illuminate it. Notn neva did a look before mi but a jet gloom, now an den mek ghastly by flashes a redness. Uppermost was di impression, dat whatever swift, rushing ting mi did stan pan neva so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing fram all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as a death, come ova mi. Convulsively mi han dem grab di tiller, but wid di crazy conceit seh di tiller did, somehow, inna some enchanted way, inverted. Mi Gad! wa a gwaan wid mi? mi did tink. Lo! inna mi brief sleep mi did turn miself bout, an did a front di ship's stern, wid mi back to har prow an di compass. Inna wan instant mi face back, jus in time fi prevent di vessel fram fly up inna di wind, an very probably capsizing har. How glad an how grateful di relief fram dis unnatural hallucination a di night, an di fatal contingency a being bringed by di lee!</p>
<p>No look too long inna di face a di fire, O man! Neva dream wid yuh han pan di helm! No ton yuh back to di compass; accept di first hint a di hitching tiller; no believe di artificial fire, wen it redness mek all tings look ghastly. To-morrow, inna di natural sun, di skai ago be bright; dem who did a glare like devils inna di forking flames, di morn ago show inna far other, at least gentler, relief; di glorious, golden, glad sun, di only true lamp—all others but liars!</p>
<p>Nevertheless di sun hide not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all di millions a miles a desert an a griefs unda di moon. Di sun nuh hide di ocean, weh a di dark side a dis earth, an weh a two thirds a dis earth. So, so, dat deh mortal man weh have more a joy dan sorrow inna him, dat deh mortal man cyaan be true—not true, or undeveloped. Wid books di same ting. Di truest a all man was di Man of Sorrows, an di truest a all books a Solomon's, an Ecclesiastes a di fine hammered steel a woe. “All a vanity.” ALL. Dis wilful worl neva get hold a unchristian Solomon's wisdom yet. But him who dodge hospitals an jails, an walk fast crossing graveyards, an woulda radda talk bout operas dan hell; call Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all a sick man; an throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, an therefore jolly;—not dat man is fitted fi sit dung pan tomb-stones, an break di green damp mold wid unfathomably wondrous Solomon.</p>
<p>But even Solomon, him seh, “di man weh wander outa di way a understanding shall remain” ( <i>ie</i> , even while living) “inna di congregation a di dead.” No gi yuhself up to fire, so it mait inverte yuh, dead yuh; as fi di time it did mi. Deh have a wisdom weh woe; but deh deh a woe weh madness. An deh have a Catskill eagle inna some souls weh can alike dive dung inna di blackest gorges, an soar out a dem again an become invisible inna di sunny spaces. An even if him fi eva fly inna di gorge, dat deh gorge deh inna di mountains; so dat even inna him lowest swoop di mountain eagle still higher dan di ada birds pan di plain, even though dem soar.</p>

<p>If yuh did descend fram di Pequod's try-works to di Pequod's forecastle, weh di off duty watch dem did a sleep, fi one single moment yuh woulda almost tink yuh did a stan op inna some illuminated shrine a canonized kings an counsellors. Deh deh dem lay inna dem triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a score a lamps a flash pan him hooded eyes.</p>
<p>Inna merchantmen, oil fi di sailor dem more scarce dan di milk a queens. Fi dress inna di dark, an eat inna di dark, an stumble inna darkness to him pallet, dis a him usual lot. But di whaleman, as him seek di food a light, so him live inna light. Him mek him berth an Aladdin's lamp, an lay him dung inna it; so dat inna di pitchiest night di ship's black hull still house an illumination.</p>
<p>Si wid weh entire freedom di whaleman tek him handful a lamps—often but old bottles an vials, though—to di copper cooler at di try-works, an replenish dem deh, as mugs a ale at a vat. Im burn, too, di purest a oil, inna it unmanufactured, an, therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid weh solar, lunar, or astral contrivances no know bout. It sweet as early grass butter inna April. Him go an hunt fi him oil, so as fi be sure a it freshness an genuineness, even as di traveler pan di prairie hunt up him own supper a game.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00103">CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down an Clearing Up.</h2>
<p>Already it been related how di great leviathan is afar off described fram di mast-head; how dem chase him ova di watery moors, an dem slaughter him inna di valleys a di deep; how dem den tow him alongside an cut him head; an how (pan di principle weh did entitled di headsman a old to di garments in which di beheaded dem did kill) him great padded surtout become di property a him executioner; how, inna due time, him get condem to di pots, an, like Shadrach, Meshach, an Abednego, him spermaceti, oil, an bone pass unscathed thru di fire;—but now it remain fi conclude di last chapter a dis part a di description by rehearsing—singing, if mi may—di romantic proceding a striking off him casks inna di oil inna di hold, weh once again leviathan return to him native profundities, sliding along beath di surface as before; but, alas! neva more fi rise an blow.</p>
<p>While still warm, di oil, like hot punch, is received inna di six-barrel casks; an while, perhaps, di ship a pitch an roll dis way an dat inna di midnight sea, di enormous casks dem a slewed round an head ova, end fi end, an sometimes perilously scoot across di slippery deck, like so many land slides, til at last man-handled an stay inna dem course; an all round di hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon dem, fi now, <i>ex officio</i> , every sailor is a cooper.</p>
<p>At length, wen di laas pint casked, an all cool, den di great hatchways dem unsealed, di bowels a di ship get throw open, an dung go di casks to dem final rest inna di sea. Dis done, di hatches dem get replace, an hermetically close, like a closet walled up.</p>
<p>Inna di sperm fishery, dis a perhaps one a di most remarkable incidents inna all di business a whaling. One day di planks dem stream wid freshets a blood an oil; pan di sacred quarter-deck enormous masses a di whale's head dem profanely piled; great rusty casks lie bout, as inna a brewery yard; di smoke fram di try-works dem besoot all di bulwarks; di mariners dem go bout suffused wid unctuousness; di entire ship look great leviathan himself; while pan all hands di din a deafening.</p>
<p>But a day or two afta, yuh look roun yuh, an prick yuh ears inna dis self-same ship; an if it neva fi di tell-tale boats an try-works, yuh woulda all but swear yuh trod some silent merchant vessel, wid a most scrupulously neat commander. Di unmanufactured sperm oil possess a singularly cleansing virtue. Dis a di reason why di decks dem neva look so white as jus afta weh dem call an affair of oil. Besides, fram di ashes a di burned scraps a di whale, a potent lye is readily mek; an whenever any adhesiveness fram di back a di whale remain clinging to di side, dat deh lye quickly exterminate it. Hans go diligently along di bulwarks, an wid buckets a water an rags restore dem to dem full tidiness. Di soot brush fram di lower rigging. All di numerous implements dem weh dem did a use dem likewise faithfully cleanse an put weh. Di great hatch is scrub an put pan di try-works, completely hiding di pots; every cask deh out a sight; all tackles dem coil inna unseen nooks; an wen by di combined an simultaneous industry a almost di entire ship's company, di whole a dis conscientious duty is at last conclude, den di crew demself proceed to dem own ablutions; shift demself fram top to toe; an finally issue to di immaculate deck, fresh an all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped fram out di daintiest Holland.</p>
<p>Now, wid elated step, dem pace di planks inna twos an threes, an humorously discourse a parlors, sofas, carpets, an fine cambrics; propose fi mat di deck; tink bout having hanging to di top; object not to tek tea by moonlight pan di piazza a di forecastle. Fi hint to such musked mariners of oil, an bone, an blubber, dem did likkle short a audacity. Dem nuh know di ting yuh distantly allude to. Away, an bring wi napkins!</p>
<p>But mark: aloft deh, at di three mast heads, stan three man intent pan spy out more whales, weh, if dem kech dem, infallibly will again soil di ole oaken furniture, an drop at least one likkle grease-spot somweh. Yea; an plenty a di time, wen, afta di severest uninterrupted labours, weh no know no night; continuing straight through fi ninety-six hours; wen fram di boat, weh dem swel op dem wrist wid all day a rowing pan di Line,—dem only step to di deck fi carry vast chains, an heave di heavy windlass, an cut an slash, yea, an inna dem very sweatings fi be smoke an burn anew by di combined fires a di equatorial sun an try-works; wen, pan di heel a all dis, dem don finally bestirred demself fi cleanse di ship, an mek a spotless dairy room a it; plenty a di time di poor fellows, jus button di neck a dem clean frocks, get startled by di cry a “There she blows!” an weh dem fly fi fight anodda whale, an go chruu di whole weary ting agen. Awo! mi fren dem, but dis a man-killing! Yet dis a life. For hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from dis world's vast bulk its small but valuable sperm; an den, wid weary patience, clean wiself fram it defilements, an laan fi live yah inna clean tabernacles a di soul; hardly dis is done, wen— <i>Deh she blow!</i> —di ghost get spouted up, an weh we sail fi fight some ada worl, an go chuu young life's old routine again.</p>
<p>Awo! di metempsychosis! Awo! Pythagoras, dat inna bright Greece, two thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; Mi sail wid yuh along di Peruvian coast last voyage—an, foolish as mi is, teach yuh, a green simple bwoy, how fi splice a rope!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00104">CHAPTER 99. Di Doubloon.</h2>
<p>Ere now it been related how Ahab was wont to pace him quarter-deck, tek regular turns at either limit, di binnacle an mainmast; but inna di multiplicity a ada tings weh need narration it neva add how dat sometimes inna dem walks yah, wen most plunged inna him mood, him was wont fi pause in turn at each spot, an stan deh strangely eyeing di particular object before him. Wen him halt before di binnacle, wid him glance fastened pan di pointed needle inna di compass, dat deh glance shot like a javelin wid di pointed intensity a him purpose; an wen him staat walk agen him pause before di mainmast, den, as di same riveted glance fastened upon di riveted gold coin deh, him still did a wear di same aspect a nailed firmness, only dashed wid a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.</p>
<p>But one morning, wen him did a turn fi pass di doubloon, him did look like him did newly attracted by di strange figures an inscriptions dem weh did stamp pan it, as if now fi di first time him did a staat fi interpret fi himself inna some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk inna dem. An some certain significance lurk inna all tings, else all tings are likkle worth, an di round world itself but an empty cipher, except fi sell by di cartload, as dem do hills bout Boston, fi fill up some morass inna di Milky Way.</p>
<p>Now dis doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, rake somewhere outa di heart a gorgeous hills, from, east an west, ova golden sands, di head-waters a many a Pactolus flows. An though now nailed midst all di rustiness a iron bolts an di verdigris a copper spikes, yet, untouchable an immaculate to any foulness, it still preserve its Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew an every hour pass by ruthless hands, an through di livelong nights shrouded wid thick darkness weh might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise find di doubloon weh di sunset lef it last. For it did set apart an sanctified fi one awe-striking end; an however wanton inna dem sailor ways, one an all, di mariners dem did a revered it as di white whale's talisman. Somtaim dem did a talk it ova inna di weary watch by night, a wanda whose it was fi be at last, an weda him woulda eva live fi spen it.</p>
<p>Now dem noble golden coins a South America deh as medals a di sun an tropic token-pieces. Yahso palms, alpacas, an volcanoes; sun's disks an stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, an rich banners waving, dem inna luxuriant profusion stamped; so dat di precious gold seems almost fi get an added preciousness an enhancing glories, by passing thru dem fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.</p>
<p>It so chanced dat di doubloon a di Pequod was a most wealthy example a dem ting deh. Pan it round border it did have di letta dem, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So dis bright coin come fram a country weh dem plant inna di middle a di worl, an unda di great equator, an name afta it; an it did get cast midway up di Andes, inna di unwaning clime weh nuh know no autumn. Zoned by dem leta deh yuh si di likeness a three Andes' summits; fram one a flame; a tower pan anodda; pan di third one a crowing cock; wile arching ova all was a segment a di partitioned zodiac, di signs dem all mark wid dem usual cabalistics, an di keystone sun entering di equinoctial point at Libra.</p>
<p>Bifuo dis equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, did a pause now.</p>
<p>“Somting eva egotistical deh inna mountain-tops an towers, an all ada grand an lofty tings; look yah,—three peaks as proud as Lucifer. Di firm tower, dat a Ahab; di volcano, dat a Ahab; di courageous, di undaunted, an victorious fowl, dat, too, a Ahab; all dis a di image a gold; di rounder globe, weh, like a magician's glass, to each an every man inna turn but mirrors back him own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains fi dem who ask di world fi solve dem. former equinox at Aries! So be it, den. Born in throes, 'tis fit dat man shuda live inna pains an dead inna pangs!</p>
<p>“No fairy fingers can have pressed di gold, but devil's claws must have lef dem moldings deh since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to himself, leaning against di bulwarks. “Di uol man luk laik im riid Belshazzar awful raitin. Mi neva maak di koin inspekshan. Im go dong; mek mi riid. Wan daak vali bitwiin chrii maiti, evn-abiding piik, we aalmuos luk laik di Trinity, ina som faint earthly symbol.

<p>“Deh deh now di old Mogul,” soliloquize Stubb by di try-works, “im a twig it; an deh go Starbuck fram di same, an both wid faces weh mi shuda seh might be someweh widin nine fathoms long. An all fram looking pon a piece a gold, weh did mi have it now pan Negro Hills or inna Corla Hook, mi neva look pan it very long it. Humph! dis doubloon a di Equator weh so killing wonderful?

<h2 id="pgepubid00105">CHAPTER 100. Leg an Arm.</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00106">Di Pequod, a Nantucket, Meets di Samuel Enderby, a London.</h3>
<p>“Ship, ahoy! Yuh si di White Whale?”</p>
<p>So Ahab baal out, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing dung unda di stern. Trumpet to mouth, di old man did a stan up inna him hoisted quarter-boat, him ivory leg plainly revealed to di stranger captain, who did a carelessly reclining inna him own boat's bow. Im was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dress inna a spacious roundabout, weh did a hang roun im inna festoons a blue pilot-cloth; an one empty arm a dis jacket stream behind him like di broidered arm a one hussar's surcoat.</p>
<p>“Yuh si di White Whale?”</p>
<p>“Yuh si dis?” an tek it outa di folds dem weh did a hide it, him hold up a white arm a sperm whale bone, terminating inna a wooden head like a mallet.</p>
<p>“Man mi boat!” Ahab baal out, impetuously, an tossing bout di oars near him—“Stand by to lower!”</p>
<p>Inna less dan a minute, widout quitting him likkle craft, him an him crew did drop to di wata, an did soon alongside a di stranger. But yahso a curious difficulty present itself. Inna di excitement a di moment, Ahab did forget seh since di loss a him leg him neva once step pan board a no vessel at sea but him own, an den it was always by an ingenious an very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to di Pequod, an a ting not fi be rigged an ship in any other vessel at a warning moment's. Now, it no very easy fi anybody—except dem who almost hourly used to it, like whalemen—fi clamber up a ship's side fram a boat pan di open sea; fi di great swells now lift di boat high up towards di bulwarks, an den instantaneously drop it half way dung to di kelson. So, deprived a one leg, an di strange ship a course being altogether unsupplied wid di kindly invention, Ahab now find himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing di uncertain changeful height weh him coulda hardly hope fi attain.</p>
<p>It have before been hinted, perhaps, dat every likkle untoward circumstance weh befell him, an weh indirectly sprang fram him luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. An inna di present instance, all dis did heightened by di sight a di two officers a di strange ship, weh did a lean ova di side, by di perpendicular ladder a nailed cleets deh, an a swing towards him a pair a tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; fi at first dem neva look like dem did a tink dem seh a one-legged man mus be too much a cripple fi use dem sea bannisters. But dis awkwardness only last a minute, cause di strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs did a stan, cried out, “Mi see, mi see!—avast heaving deh! Jump, boys, an swing ova di cutting-tackle.”</p>
<p>As good luck woulda have it, dem did have a whale alongside a day or two before, an di great tackles dem did still aloft, an di massive curved blubber-hook, now clean an dry, did still attached to di end. Dis was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid him solitary thigh inna di curve a di hook (it was like setting inna di fluke a an anchor, or di crotch a one apple tree), an den gi di wod, hold himself fast, an at di same time also help fi hoist him own weight, pull-over-hand-hand part a di one a di tackle. Soon him did carefully swing inside di high bulwarks, an gently land upon di capstan head. Wid him ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, di ada captain advance, an Ahab, putting out him ivory leg, an crossing di ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out inna him walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! mek wi shake bones together!—an arm an a leg!—an arm weh neva can dry an see a leg; dat neva can run. Weh yuh did si di White Whale?—how long ago?”</p>
<p>“Di White Whale,” di Englishman seh, pointing him ivory arm towards di East, an tek a rueful sight along it, as if it was a telescope; “deh mi si him, pan di Line, laas season.”</p>
<p>“An him tek dat deh arm off, him?” aks Ahab, now sliding dung fram di capstan, an resting pan di Englishman's shoulda, as him did a do so.</p>
<p>“Aye, him was di cause a it, at least; an dat deh leg, too?”</p>
<p>“Spin mi di yarn,” seh Ahab; “how it was?”</p>
<p>“A did di first time inna mi life dat mi eva cruise pan di Line,” di Englishman staat. “Mi neva nuo bout di White Whale at dat time. Well, one day wi lower fi a pod a four or five whales, an mi boat fasten to one a dem; a regular circus horse him was, too, weh did a go milling an milling round so, dat mi boat's crew coulda only trim dish, by sitting all dem sterns pan di outer gunwale breach up fram di sea. a bouncing great whale, wid a milky-white head an hump, all crows' feet an wrinkles.”</p>
<p>“A him, a him!” Ahab baal out, suddenly let out him suspended breath.</p>
<p>“An harpoons stick in near him starboard fin.”</p>
<p>“Aye, aye—dem was mine— <i>mi</i> irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”</p>
<p>“Gi mi a chance, den,” di Englishman seh, good-humored. “Well, dis old great-granfada, wid di white head an hump, run all afoam inna di pod, an go to snapping furiously at mi fast-line!</p>
<p>“Aye, mi see!—wanted fi part it; free di fast-fish—an old trick—mi know him.”</p>
<p>“How it was exactly,” di one-armed commander continued, “mi nuh know; but wen it did a bait di line, it get foul a him teet, ketch deh somehow; but wi neva know it den; so dat wen wi aftawards pull pan di line, bounce wi come plump on to him hump! instead a di ada whale's dem did go wind off fi seh how wi did a flutter; stan op, an weh a noble great whale it was—di noblest an biggest mi eva si, sa, inna mi life—mi resolve fi capture him, spite a di boiling rage weh him did a look like him did deh inna. An mi did a tink seh di hap-hazard line woulda get loose, or di tooth weh it did tangle to mighta draw (cause mi have a devil a boat's sell fi pull all-seale); dis, mi seh, mi jump inna mi first mate's boat—by di way, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—di captain);—as mi did a seh, mi jump inna Mounttop's boat, weh, d'ye see, did a gunwale an gunwale wid mine, den; yuh, sir—hearts an souls alive, man—di next instant, inna a jiff, mi did blind as a bat—both eyes out—all befogged an bedeadened wid black foam—di whale's tail looming straight up outa it, perpendicular inna di air, like a marble steeple. all crown-jewels; as mi did a grope, mi seh, afta di secan iron, fi tos it ovaboard—dung come di tail like a Lima tower, cutting mi boat inna two, lef each half inna splinters, an, flukes first, di white hump back thru di wreck, as if it was all chips. We all struck out of his seilings. harpoon-pole stick inna him, an fi a moment clung to dat like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dash mi off, an at di same instant, di fish, tek one good dart forwards, go dung like a flash an di barb a dat deh cursed secan iron towing along near mi ketch mi yah” (clapping him han jos below him shoulda); “yes, kech mi jus yah, mi seh, an bore mi dung to Hell's flames, mi did a tink; wen, wen, all a sudden, tank di good God, di barb ript it way along di flesh—clear along di whole length a mi arm—com out nigh mi wrist, an up mi float;—an dat deh gentleman deh ago tell di young way, di captain. ship's surgeon: Bunger, mi lad,—di captain Now, Bunger bwai, spin yuh part a di yarn.”</p>
<p>Di professional gentleman weh dem did point out, did all di time a stan op near dem, wid notn specific visible, fi denote him gentlemanly rank pan board. Him face was an exceedingly round but sober one; him did dress inna a faded blue woolen frock or shirt, an patched trousers; an did so far a divide him attention between a marlingspike weh him did a hold inna one han, an a pill-box weh him did a hold inna di ada han, occasionally casting a critical glance at di ivory limbs a di two crippled captains. But, at him superior's introduction a him to Ahab, him politely bow, an straightway go on fi do him captain's bidding.</p>
<p>“It was a shocking bad wound,” di whale-surgeon staat; “an, tek mi advice, Captain Boomer yah, did a stan wi uol Sammy—”</p>
<p>“Samuel Enderby a di name a mi ship,” di one-armed captain interrupted, addressing Ahab; “go on, bwai.”</p>
<p>“Stood wi old Sammy off to di northward, fi get outa di blazing hot weather deh pan di Line. But it neva use—mi did all mi coulda; did sidong wid him nights; did very severe wid him inna di matter a diet—”</p>
<p>“Oh, very severe!” chimed in di patient himself; den suddenly altering him voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies wid mi every night, til him couldn't see fi put on di bandages; an sen mi to bed, half seas ova, bout three o'clock inna di morning. Oh, ye stars! him did sidong wid mi indeed, an did very severe inna mi diet. Oh, an very severe watcher, an Dr Butetetic is very sever. (Bunger, yuh dog, laugh out! why yuh don't? Yuh know yuh a one precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead, bwoy, mi woulda radda get kill by yuh dan keep alive by any other man.”</p>
<p>“Mi captain, yuh mus have ere dis perceived, respected sir”—seh di imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt fi be facetious at times; him spin wi plenty clever tings a dat deh sort. But mi may as well seh—en passant, as di French remark—dat miself—dat a fi seh, Bunger, late, rever di Jack clergy—mi a strict total abstinence man;</p>
<p>"Wata!" di captain did a baal out; “im neva drink it; it's a sort a fits to him; fresh wata throw him inna di hydrophobia; but go on—go on wid di arm story.”</p>
<p>“Yes, mi mait as well,” di surgeon seh, coolly. “Mi did bout a observe, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, dat spite a mi bes an severest endeavors, di wound did a get worse an worse; di truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon eva si; ​​more dan two feet an several inches long. Mi measure it wid di lead line short Inna weh mi did know; threaten, an off it come. But mi neva have no hand inna shipping dat deh ivory arm deh; flyes into diabolical passions sometimes. Do yuh see dis dent, sir”—removing him hat, an brush aside him hair, an exposing a bowl-like cavity inna him skull, but weh neva have di slightest scarry trace, or any token a ever been a wound—“Well, di captain deh will tell yuh how him come yah.”</p>
<p>“No, mi no,” di captain seh, “but him mada did; him did born wid it. Oh, yuh solemn rogue, yuh—yuh Bunger! yuh did eva have such anoda Bunger inna di watery worl? Bunger, wen yuh die, yuh shuda die inna pickle, yuh dog; yuh shuda be preserved to future ages, yuh rascal.”</p>
<p>“Weh happen to di White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far did a lisn tu dis by-play between di two Englishmen dem.</p>
<p>"Awo!" di one-armed captain baal out, "oh, yes! Well; afta him sound, wi neva si him agen fi likl bit a taim; in fak, az mi did hint bifuo, mi neva den nuo weh whale it was weh did sorv mi soch a trick, til som taim aftawod, wen wi kom bak a di Line, wi ier bout Moby Dick—az som piipl kaal im—an mi did nuo se im did."</p>
<p>“Yuh cross him wake again?”</p>
<p>"Two time."</p>
<p>“But yuh couldn't fasten?”</p>
<p>“Mi neva waan try to: ain't one limb enough? Weh mi fi do widout dis ada arm? An mi a tink Moby Dick nuh bite so much as him swallow.”</p>
<p>“Well, den,” Bunger interrupted, “gi him yuh left arm fi bait fi get di right. Yuh know, gentlemen”—very gravely an mathematically bowing to each Captain inna succession—“Yuh know, gentlemen, seh di digestive organs a di whale so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, dat it is quite impossible fi him completely even diges a mans arm? An him know it too. So dat weh yuh tek fi di White Whale's malice is only him awkwardness. For him only tink fi terrify by feints; earnest, an deh it stay fi a twelvemonth or more; wen mi gi him an emetic, an him heave it up inna likkle tacks, d'ye see. No possible way fi him digest dat deh jack-knife, an fully incorporate it inna him general body system Yes, Captain Boomer, if yuh quick enough fi have a pawn of di privilege fi gi him. decent burial to di other, why inna dat deh case di arm is fi yuh; only mek di whale have anodda chance at yuh shortly, dat's all.”</p>
<p>“No, tank yuh, Bunger,” seh di English Captain, “im welcome to di arm weh him have, since mi cyan help it, an mi neva know him den; but not to anodda one. No more White Whales fi mi; mi did lower fi him once, an dat did satisfy mi. It woulda be great glory fi kill him, an deh deh a harmship, but harm inna him; ye, him bes let alone; yuh no tink so, Captain?”—glancing at di ivory leg.</p>
<p>“Im deh. But him still ago get hunt, fi all dat. Weh is best let alone, dat accursed ting is not always weh least allures. Him all a magnet! How long since yuh si him last? Which way heading?”</p>
<p>“Bless mi soul, an curse di foul fiend’s,” Bunger baal out, stoopingly walk roun Ahab, an like a dog, strangely snuffing; “dis man blood—bring di thermometer!—it deh a di boiling point!—im pulse mek dem plank yah beat!—sar!”—tek a lancet fram im pocket, an draw near to Ahab arm.</p>
<p>“Avast!” roar Ahab, dash him against di bulwarks—“Man di boat! Weh way a go?”</p>
<p>“Gud God!” di Inglish Kaptan baal out, uu dem did a aks di kweschan tu. “Weh di mata? Him did a head east, mi tink.—Yuh Captain crazy?” whispering Fedallah.</p>
<p>But Fedallah, putting a finger pan him lip, slid ova di bulwarks fi tek di boat's steering oar, an Ahab, swinging di cutting-tackle towards him, command di ship's sailors fi stan by fi lower.</p>
<p>Inna a moment him did a stan up inna di boat's stern, an di Manilla man dem did a spring to dem oars. Inna vain di English Captain hail him. Wid back to di stranger ship, an face set like a flint to him own, Ahab stan up upright til alongside a di Pequod.</p>
