<p>Di maanin a di tord die did don fair an fresh, an once more di solitary night-man at di fore-mast-head did get relieve by crowds a di daylight look-outs, weh did a dot every mast an almost every spar.</p>
<p>“Yu si im?” Ahab did a baal out; but di whale neva deh inna di sight yet.</p>
<p>“Inna him infallible wake, though; but follow dat wake, dat's all. Helm deh; steady, as thou goest, an has been going. Wat a lovely day again! were it a new-made world, an mek fi a summer-house to di angels, an dis morning di first a it throw open to dem, a fairer day couldn't dawn upon dat deh world's had fi dawe, A time to dawn. tink; but Ahab neva tink; him only feel, feel, <i>feel</i> ; calm, dis ole skull crack so, like a glass in which di contents turn to ice, an shiver it. An still dis hair a grow now, an heat haffi breed it anyweh, between di earthy clefts a Greenland ice or inna Vesuvius wind it bout di whip it; shreds a split sails lash di tossed ship dem cling to. A vile wind weh no doubt blow ere dis thru prison corridors an cells, an wards a hospitals, an ventilated dem, an now come blowing hither as inocent as fleeces upon it!—it's tainted. worl. Mi woulda crawl somwe to a cave, an slink deh. An yet, 'is a noble an heroic ting, di wind it have di last an bitterest blow Run tilting at it, an yuh but run through it. braver ting—a nobler ting dan <i>dat</i> . Wuda now di wind but did have a body; but all di tings dem weh most exasperate an outrage mortal man, all dem ting deh a bodyless, but only bodyless as objects, not as agents Deh deh a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference! Dem warm Trade Winds, at least, weh inna di clear heavens blow straight on, inna strong an steadfast, vigorous mildness; an dem nuh veer fram dem mark, however di baser currents a di sea may turn an tack, an mightiest Mississippies a di land swift an swerve bout, uncertain weh fi go at last by di eternal Poldes so dat mi blow directly! on; dem Trades yah, or someting so unchangeable, an full as strong, blow mi keeled soul along To it!</p>
<p>“Notn, sa.”</p>
<p>“Notn! an noon at hand! Di doubloon go a-begging! See di sun! Aye, aye, it mus be so. Mi don oversail him. How, got di staat? Aye, him a chase <i>mi</i> now; not mi, <i>him</i> —dat bad; mi mighta did know it, too. Fool! di lines—di harpoon dem weh him did a run by him, Aye, Aye, mi have last run by him. night. About! come dung, all a unu, but di regular look outs!</p>
<p>Steering as she did do, di wind did deh likkle bit pan di Pequod's quarter, so dat now being pointed inna di reverse direction, di braced ship did a sail hard upon di breeze as she did a return di cream inna har own white wake.</p>
<p>“Against di wind him now steer fi di open jaw,” Starbuck murmured to himself, as him coil di new-hauled main-brace upon di rail. “Gad kip wi, bot aredi mi buon dem a damp iina mi, an fram mi iinsaid a wet mi flesh.</p>
<p>“Stand by fi sway mi up!” Ahab baal out, a goh tu di hempen basket. “Wi shuda meet him soon.”</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” an straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, an once more Ahab swing on high.</p>
<p>A whole hour now pass; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now hold long breaths wid keen suspense. But at last, some three points off di weather bow, Ahab describe di spout again, an instantly fram di three mast-heads three shrieks go up as if di tongues a fire did voice it.</p>
<p>“Forehead to forehead mi meet yuh, dis third time, Moby Dick! Pan deck deh!—brace sharper up; crowd har inna di wind's eye. Him too far off fi lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. Di sails dem shake! Stand ova dat deh helmsman wid a top-maul! So, so; him travel fast an dung, but mi haffi have more look round more. aloft yah at di sea; deh deh time fi dat. An old, old sight, an yet somehow so young; aye, an neva change a wink since mi first see it, a bwoy, fram di sand-hills a Nantucket Di same!—di same ting to Noah as to me. common lan, more palmy dan di palms! Matter's. But aye, old mast, we both grow old; sound inna wi hulls, though, are not we, mi ship? Aye, minus a leg, dat's all By heaven dis dead wood have the better of mi live flesh every way mi can't compare wid it, an mi know some dead ships mek outa di most vital stuffs; fadda dem. Weh him seh? deh yuh shot did fall short. Good-bye, mast-head—keep a good eye upon di whale, di while mi gone.</p>
<p>Im gi di wod; an still a look roun him, did steadily lower thru di cloven blue air to di deck.</p>
<p>Inna di right time di boats dem did lower; but as standing inna him shallop's stern, Ahab jus hover pan di point a di descent, him wave to di mate,—who did a hold one a di tackle-ropes pan deck—an bade him pause.</p>
<p>“Starbuck!”</p>
<p>"Sar?"</p>
<p>“Fi di third time mi soul's ship staat pan dis voyage, Starbuck.”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir, yuh wi have it so.”</p>
<p>“Some ships sail fram dem ports, an ever afterwards dem miss, Starbuck!”</p>
<p>“Truth, sir: saddest truth.”</p>
<p>“Some man die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at di full a di flood;—an mi feel now like a billow dat a all one crested comb, Starbuck. Mi old;—shake hands wid mi, man.”</p>
<p>Dem han dem meet; dem eyes fastened; Starbuck's tears di glue.</p>
<p>“Oh, mi kyapten, mi kyapten!—nobl aat—go no—go no!—si, a wan brait man we a baal; ou big di agony a di persuasion den!”</p>
<p>“Lower away!”—Ahab baal out, a tos di matiiryal an fram im. “Stand by di crew!”</p>
<p>Inna wan instant di boat did a pull round close unda di stern.</p>
<p>“Di shark dem! di shark dem!” a voice baal out fram di low cabin-window deh; “Oh master, mi master, come back!”</p>
<p>But Ehab neva hear nutten; fi him own voice did high-lifted den; an di buot jomp aan.</p>
<p>Yet di voice did a seh true; fi scarce him did push fram di ship, wen numba a sharks, weh did a luk laik dem did a rise fram outa di daak waata dem anda di hull, did a snap di blades a di oars, evri taim dem did a dip inna di waata; an inna dis way dem did a come wid di boat wid dem bites. A wan ting weh no uncommonly happen to di whale-boats dem inna dem swarming seas deh; di shark dem at times apparently a follow dem inna di same prescient way weh vultures hover ova di banners a marching regiments inna di east. But dem was di first sharks weh di Pequod did observe since di White Whale did fos get describe; an weda it was dat Ahab's crew was all such tiger-yellow barbarians, an therefore dem flesh more musky to di senses a di sharks—a matter sometimes well known fi affect dem,—however it was, dem did look like dem did a follow dat deh one boat widout molesting di others.</p>
<p>“Heart a wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing ova di side, an following wid him eyes di receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly to dat sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by dem, open-mouthed to the chase; and dis the critical third day?—For wen three days flow together in one continuous pursuit, the first sure is the morning; noon, an di third di evening an di end a dat deh ting it may. Oh mi God! behind me boy! Mi see but yuh eyes dem grow blue. But clouds a sweep between—Mi journey's end a come? loud!—Mast-head deh!—Crazed;—aloft deh!—keep thy keenest eye upon di boats:—mark well see! it!—Weh di uol man deh now?</p>
<p>Di boat dem neva go very far, wen by a signal fram di mast-heads—a downward pointed arm, Ahab did know seh di whale did sound; but intending fi deh near him at di next rising, him hold on him way a likkle sideways fram di vessel; di becharmed crew maintaining di profoundest silence, as di head-beat waves hammered an hammered against di opposing bow.</p>
<p>“Drive, drive inna yuh nails, oh ye waves! to dem uttermost heads drive dem in! yuh but strike a ting widout a lid; an no coffin an no hearse can be mine:—an hemp only can kill mi! Ha! ha!”</p>
<p>Suddenly di waters roun dem slowly swell inna broad circles; den quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding fram a submerged berg a ice, swiftly rising to di surface. A low rumbling sound did hear; a subterraneous hum; an den all a dem hold dem breath; as bedraggled wid trailing ropes, an harpoons, an lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely fram di sea. Shrouded inna a thin drooping veil a mist, it hover fi a moment inna di rainbowed air; an den fall swamping back inna di deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, di waters flash fi an instant like heaps a fountains, den brokenly sink inna a shower a flakes, lef di circling surface creamed like new milk round di marble trunk a di whale.</p>
<p>“Give way!” Ahab baal out tu di oarsman dem, an di boat dem dart forward fi di attack; but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons weh corrode inna him, Moby Dick did look combinedly possessed by all di angels weh did fall fram heaven. Di wide tiers a welded tendons weh did a overspread him broad white forehead, unda di transparent skin, did look knitted tugeda; as head on, him come churning him tail mongst di boats; an once more flailed dem apart; spill out di irons an lances fram di two mates dem boat, an dash inna one side a di upper part a dem bow, but lef Ahab's almost widout a scar.</p>
<p>While Daggoo an Queequeg did a stop di strained planks; an as di whale did a swim outa dem, turn, an show one entire flank as him shot by dem again; at dat deh moment a quick cry go up. Lashed round an round to di fish's back; pinioned inna di turns upon turns in which, during di past night, di whale did reel di involutions a di lines roun him, di half torn body a di Parsee did seen; him sable raiment frayed to shreds; him distended eyes dem turn full pan old Ahab.</p>
<p>Di harpoon drop fram him han.</p>
<p>“Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! Mi see yuh again.—Aye, an yuh go before; an dis, <i>dis</i> den a di hearse weh yuh did promise. But mi hold yuh to di last letter a yuh word. Weh di secan hearse deh? Away, mates, to di boats are useless if repair dem now! yuh can inna time, an return to mi; if not, Ahab is enough fi die—Down, man!</p>
<p>But him look too nier di boat; fi as if bent pan escape wid di corpse weh him did a bear, an as if di particular place a di last encounter did been but a stage inna him leeward voyage, Moby Dick did a now again steadily swimming forward; an did almost pass di ship,—we so far did a sail inna di contrary direction to him, though fi di present har headway did stop. Im did look like im did a swim wid im utmost velocity, an now only intent pan pursuing im own straight path inna di sea.</p>
<p>“Oh! Ahab,” Starbuck baal out, “not too late is it, even now, di third day, fi desist. See! Moby Dick nuh look fi yuh. A yuh, yuh, weh madly seek him!”</p>
<p>Setting sail to di rising wind, di lonely boat did swiftly impelled to leeward, by both oars an canvas. An at last wen Ahab did a slide by di vessel, so near as plainly fi distinguish Starbuck's face as him did a lean ova di rail, him hail him fi turn di vessel bout, an follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, him si Tashtego, Queequeg, an Daggoo, eagerly mounting to di three mast-heads; while di oarsmen dem did a rock inna di two staved boats dem weh did jus get hoist to di side, an dem did busy a work inna repair dem. One afta di ada, chruu di port-holes, as him did a sped, him did ketch flying glimpses a Stubb an Flask, a busy demself pan deck mongst bundles a new irons an lances. As him si all a dis; as him hear di hammers inna di broken boat dem; far ada hammers did a drive a nail inna him heart. But him rally. An now marking seh di vane or flag did gaan fram di main-mast-head, him shout to Tashtego, who did jus gain dat deh perch, fi descend again fi anodda flag, an a hammer an nails, an so nail it to di mast.</p>
<p>Weda fagged by di three days' running chase, an di resistance to him swimming inna di knotted hamper weh him did a bear; or weda it was some latent deceitfulness an malice inna him: whichever was true, di White Whale's way now staat abate, as it seemed, fram di boat so rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed di whale's last start neva did so long a one as before. An still as Ahab did a glide ova di waves di unpitying sharks dem did a come wid him; an so pertinaciously stick to di boat; an so continually bit at di plying oars, dat di blades dem get jagged an crunched, an lef small splinters inna di sea, at almost every dip.</p>
<p>“No bada lisn tu dem! dem teet de bot gi nyuu rowlocks tu yu oar dem. Pul aan! 'tis di beta res, di shark jakit dan di yielding waata.”</p>
<p>“But at every bite, sir, di thin blades dem grow smaller an smaller!”</p>
<p>“Dem ago laas lang inof! pul aan!—Bot uu kyan tel”—im mutter—“weda dem shark ya swim fi feast pan di wail animal ar pan Ahab?—Bot pul aan! Aye, aal a dem alaiv, nou—wi de nier im. Di helm! tek di helm! mek mi paas,”—an so di tuu a di oar dem stil elp im forda tu di bow dem flying boat.</p>
<p>At length as di craft did a cast to one side, an run ranging along wid di White Whale's flank, him did look strangely oblivious a it advance—as di whale sometimes will—an Ahab did fairly widin di smoky mountain mist, weh, throw off fram di whale's spout, curle round him great Monnock; him did even so close to him; wen, wid body arch back, an both arms lengthwise high-lifted to di poise, him dart him fierce iron, an him far fiercer curse inna di hated whale. As both steel an curse did a sink to di socket, as if dem did a suck inna a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically roll him nigh flank against di bow, an, widout staving a hole inna it, so suddenly canted di boat ova, dat if it neva did fi di elevated part a di gunwale weh him den clung to, Ahab woulda once more get tossed inna di sea. As it was, three a di oarsmen dem—who foreknew not di precise instant a di dart, an dem neva ready fi it effects—dem did fling out; but so fall, dat, inna one instant two a dem clutch di gunwale again, an rise to it level pan a combing wave, hurl demself bodyly inboard again; di third man helplessly a drop astern, but still a float an a swim.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, wid a mighty volition a ungraduated, instantaneous swiftness, di White Whale darted thru di weltering sea. But wen Ahab did a baal out to di steersman fi tek new turn wid di line, an hold it so; an im tel di kruu fi ton roun pan dem siit, an tow di buot op tu di maak; di moment di treacherous line did feel dat double strain an tug, it snap inna di empty air!</p>
<p>“Weh break inna mi? Some sinew cracks!—'tis whole again; oars! oars! Burst in upon him!”</p>
<p>Wen him hear di tremendous rush a di sea-crashing boat, di whale wheel round fi present him blank forehead at bay; but inna dat deh evolution, catching sight a di nearing black hull a di ship; seemingly seeing inna it di source a all him persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a larger an nobler foe; a sudden, him bore dung pan it advancing prow, smiting him jaws amid fiery showers a foam.</p>
<p>Ahab did a stagger; him han hit him forehead. “Mi a blain, chrech out unu an dem infronta mi so mi kyan grab op mi wie yet, an a no nait?”</p>
<p>“Di whale! Di ship!” di cringing oarsmen dem did a baal out.</p>
<p>“Oars! oars! Slope dung to yuh depths, O sea, dat ere it be fi ever too late, Ahab may slide dis last, last time pan him mark! Mi see: di ship! di ship! Dash on, mi man dem! Yuh naa go save mi ship?”</p>
<p>But as di oarsmen dem violently force dem boat chruu di sledge-hammering seas, di before whale-smitten bow-ends a two planks burst chruu, an inna wan instant almost, di temporarily disabled boat did lay nearly level wid di waves; it half-wading, splash crew, trying hard fi stop di gap an bale out di pouring water.</p>
<p>Meantime, fi dat one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer did a stay suspended inna him han; an di red flag, half-wrapping him as wid a plaid, den stream itself straight out fram him, as him own forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck an Stubb, stan up pan di bowsprit unda, ketch sight a di dung-coming monster jus as soon as him.</p>
<p>“Di whale, di whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all unu sweet powers a air, now hug mi close! Mek Starbuck nuh dead, if die him haffi, inna a woman's fainting fit. Up helm, mi seh—ye fools, di jaw! di jaw! A dis a di end a all mi bursting prayers? all mi life-long fidelities, Ohab, Ahab, Ahab, Ahab, Ahab, Ahab fidelities? yuh work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Him turn fi meet wi!</p>
<p>“Stand no by mi, but stan unda mi, whoever yuh is weh will now help Stubb; fi Stubb, too, stick yah. Mi grin at yuh, yuh grinning whale! Who eva help Stubb, or keep Stubb awake, but Stubb's own unwinking eye? An now poor Stubb go to bed pan a matrass dat all it woulda stuffed wid brushwood; grin at yuh, yuh grinning whale! Look yuh, sun, moon, an stars! Mi call yuh assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. Ahab! Fi mi, off shoes an jacket to it;</p>
<p>“Cherries? Mi only wish seh wi did deh weh dem grow. Oh, Stubb, mi hope mi poor mada did draw mi part-pay ere dis; if not, few coppers ago come to har now, fi di voyage don.”</p>
<p>Fram di ship's bows, nearly all di seamen dem now hang inactive; hammers, bits a plank, lances, an harpoons, mechanically retained inna dem hands, jus as dem did darted fram dem various employments; all dem enchanted eyes intent pan di whale, weh fram side to side strangely vibrate him predestinating head, sen a broad band a overspreading semicircular foam before him as him rush. Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice did deh inna him whole aspect, an spite a all weh mortal man coulda do, di solid white buttress a him forehead did a smote di ship's starboard bow, til man an timbers did a reel. Som a dem jrap flat pan dem fies. Like dislodged trucks, di heads a di harpooneers aloft did a shake pan dem bull-like necks. Thru di breach, dem hear di waters pour, as mountain torrents dung a flume.</p>
<p>“Di ship! Di hearse!—di secan hearse!” Ahab did a baal out fram di boat; “it wood coulda only be American!”</p>
<p>Diving beath di settling ship, di whale run quivering along it keel; but turning unda water, swiftly shot to di surface again, far off di other bow, but widin a few yards of Ahab's boat, weh, fi a time, him did a lay quiescent.</p>
<p>“Mi turn mi body fram di sun. Weh ho, Tashtego! mek mi hear yuh hammer. Oh! yuh three unsurrendered spires a mi; yuh uncracked keel; an only god-bullied hull; yuh firm deck, an haughty helm, an Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious ship, den yuh haffi perish widout di last mi cut? pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now mi feel mi topmost greatness lay inna mi topmost grief fram all yuh furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, an top dis one piled comber of my whole foregone life, towards all tode! whale; to di last mi grapple wid yuh <i>;</i></p>
<p>Di harpoon did dart; di stricken whale fly forward; wid igniting velocity di line run thru di grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stoop fi clear it; him did clear it; but di flying turn ketch him roun di neck, an voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring dem victim, him get shot outa di boat, ere di crew did know him did gone. Next instant, di heavy eye-splice inna di rope's final end fly outa di stark-empty tub, knock dung an oarsman, an smiting di sea, disappear inna it depths.</p>
<p>Fi a instant, di trance boat's crew stan up still; den turn. “Di ship? Great God, weh di ship deh?” Soon dem through dim, bewildering mediums si har sidelong fading phantom, as inna di gaseous Fata Morgana; only di uppermost masts out a water; while fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to dem once lofty perches, di pagan harpooneers still maintain dem sinking lookouts pan di sea. An now, concentric circles seize di lone boat itself, an all it crew, an each floating oar, an every lance-pole, an spinning, animate an inanimate, all round an round inna one vortex, carry di smallest chip a di Pequod out a sight.</p>
<p>But as di last whelmings dem intermixingly pour demself ova di sunken head a di Indian at di mainmast, lef a few inches a di erect spar yet visible, tugeda wid lang streaming yards a di flag, weh calmly undulate, wid ironical coincidings, ova di destroying billows dem almost toch—at dat deh red arm, hover an instant; backwardly uplifted inna di open air, inna di act a nailing di flag faster an yet faster to di subsiding spar. A sky-hawk weh tauntingly did a follow di main-truck dongwards fram it natural home among di stars, a pecking at di flag, an a incommoding Tashtego deh; dis bird now chance fi intercept it broad fluttering wing between di hammer an di wood; an simultaneously feeling dat etherial thrill, di submerged savage unda, inna him death-gasp, kip him hammer frozen deh; an so di bird a heaven, wid archangelic shrieks, an him imperial beak thrust upwards, an him whole captive form fold inna di flag a Ahab, go dong wid him ship, weh, like Satan, wouldn't sink to hell til she did drag a living part a heaven along wid har, an helmet wid it.</p>
<p>Now small fowls did a fly scream ova di yet yawning gulf; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides; den all collapse, an di great shroud a di sea roll on as it roll five thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Di drama don. Why den yah any one step forth?—Cause one did survive di wreck.</p>
<p>It so chanced, dat afta di Parsee's disappearance, mi was him weh di Fates ordained fi tek di place a Ahab's bowsman, wen dat deh bowsman tek di vacant post; di same, who, wen pan di last day di three man dem did get tossed fram outa di rocking boat, did get drop astern. So, floating pan di margin a di ensuing scene, an inna full sight a it, wen di halfspent suction a di sunk ship reach mi, mi did den, but slowly, drawn towards di closing vortex. Wen mi reach it, it did subside to a creamy pool. Round an round, den, an ever contracting towards di button-like black bubble at di axis a dat deh slowly wheeling circle, like anodda Ixion mi did revolve. Til, wen yuh get dat deh vital centre, di black bubble upward burst; an now, liberated by reason a it cunning spring, an, owing to it great buoyancy, rising wid great force, di coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise fram di sea, fall ova, an float by mi side.
