<h2 id="pgepubid00006">CHAPTER 1. Loomings.</h2>
<p>Call mi Ishmael. Som years ago—neva mind how long precisely—having likkle or no money inna mi purse, an notn particular fi interest mi pan shore, mi did tink mi woulda sail bout a likkle an see di watery part a di worl. A one way mi have fi drive off di spleen an regulate di circulation. Enitaim mi fain miself a gruo grim bout di mout; weneva it a damp, drizzly November inna mi soul; whenever mi find miself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, an bringing up di rear a every funeral mi meet; an especially weneva mi hypos get such an upper hand a mi, dat it require a strong moral principle fi prevent mi fram deliberately step inna di street, an methodically knock people's hats off—den, mi account it high time fi get to sea as soon as mi can. Dis a mi substitute fi pistol an ball. Wid a philosophical flourish Cato throw himself pan him sword; Mi quietly tek to di ship. Notn nuh surprising inna dis. If dem did know it, almost all man inna dem degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly di same feelings towards di ocean wid mi.</p>
<p>Deh deh now yuh insular city a di Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surround it wid har surf. Right an left, di streets tek yuh waterward. It extreme downtown is di battery, weh dat deh noble mole get wash by waves, an cool by breezes, weh a few hours before did outa sight a lan. Look pon di crowd a water-gazers deh deh.</p>
<p>Circumambulate di city a one dreamy Sabbath aftanuun. Go fram Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, an fram deh, by Whitehall, northward. Weh yuh si?—Posted like silent sentinels all roun di town, stand thousands upon thousands a mortal man fixed inna ocean reveries. Some leaning against di spiles; some a dem did a sidong pan di pier-heads; some a look ova di bulwarks a ships fram China; some high aloft inna di rigging, as if dem a try fi get a still better seaward peep. Bot dem ya a aal lansman; a week days pent up inna lath an plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. So how dis fi go? Di green fields dem gaan? Weh dem do yah?</p>
<p>Bot luk! yah come more crowds, pacing straight fi di water, an seeming bound fi a dive. Diffrent! Notn naa go content dem but di extremest limit a di lan; loitering unda di shady lee a yonder warehouses naa go suffice. No. Dem haffi get jus as nigh di wata as dem possibly can widout falling in. An deh dem stan—miles a dem—leagues. Inlanders all, dem come fram lanes an alleys, streets an avenues—north, east, south, an west. Yet yahso dem all unite. Tell mi, di magnetic virtue a di needles a di compasses a all dem ship deh attract dem deh?</p>
<p>Once more. Seh yuh deh inna di country; inna some high lan a lakes. Tek almost any path yuh please, an ten to one it carry yuh dung inna a dale, an lef yuh deh by a pool inna di stream. Magic deh inna it. Mek di most absent-minded a man dem be plunged inna him deepest reveries—stand dat deh man pan him legs, set him feet a-going, an him wi infallibly lead yuh to water, if water deh inna all dat deh region. If yuh eva be thirst inna di great American desert, try dis experiment, if yuh caravan happen fi be supplied wid a metaphysical professor. Yes, as everybody know, meditation an water wedded fi eva.</p>
<p>But yahso a one artist. Im waan paint yuh di dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit a romantic landscape inna all di valley a di Saco. Weh a di chief element weh him use? Deh stan him trees, each wid a hollow trunk, as if a hermit an a crucifix did deh widin; an yahso him meadow sleep, an deh him cattle sleep; an up fram yonder cottage go a sleepy smoke. Deep inna distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed inna dem hill-side blue. But though di picture lies so trance, an though dis pine-tree shake dung it sighs like leaves pan dis shepherd head, yet all was vain, unless di shepherd eye did fix pan di magic stream before him. Go visit di Prairies inna June, wen fi scores pan scores a miles yuh wade knee-deep mongst Tiger-lilies—weh di one charm weh yuh waan?—Water—no drop a water deh deh! If Niagara was but a cataract of sand, yuh woulda travel yuh thousand miles fi see it? Wa mek di poor poet a Tennessee, wen him suddenly get two handful a silver, did a deliberate weda fi buy him a coat, weh him did sadly need, or invest him money inna a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Wa mek almost every robust healthy bwoy wid a robust healthy soul inna him, at some time or other crazy fi go a sea? Why pan yuh first voyage as a passenger, yuhself did feel such a mystical vibration, wen dem fos tell yuh seh yuh an yuh ship did deh out a lan? Wa mek di uol Persians dem did hold di sea holy? Wa mek di Greeks dem gi it a separate deity, an own bredda a Jove? Surely all dis a nuh widout meaning. An still deeper di meaning a dat deh story a Narcissus, who because him couldn't grasp di tormenting, mild image him see inna di fountain, plonge inna it an get drown. But dat deh same image, wi self see inna all rivers an oceans. A di image a di ungraspable phantom a life; an dis a di key to it all.</p>
<p>Now, wen mi seh dat mi inna di habit fi go a sea weneva mi staat grow hazy bout di eyes, an staat fi be ova conscious a mi lungs, mi no mean fi have it inferred seh mi eva go a sea as a passenger. Fi go as a passenger yuh haffi have a purse, an a purse a jus a rag unless yuh have someting inna it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—no enjoy demself much, as a general ting;—no, mi neva go as a passenger; nor, though mi a someting a salt, mi eva go a sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. Mi lef di glory an distinction a dem deh offices deh to dem weh like dem. Fi mi part, mi abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, an tribulations a every kind whatsoever. A quite as much as mi can do fi tek care a miself, widout tek care a ships, barques, brigs, schooners, an weh not. An as fi go as cook,—though mi confess seh yuh have considerable glory inna dat, a cook being a sort a officer pan ship-board—yet, somehow, mi neva fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously buttered, an judgmatically salted an peppered, deh nuh have nobadi weh will talk more respectfully, not broiledly, reverentially fowl dan mi will. A outa di idolatrous dotings a di old Egyptians upon broiled ibis an roasted river horse, dat yuh see di mummies a dem creatures inna dem huge bake-houses di pyramids.</p>
<p>No, wen mi go a sea, mi go as a simple sailor, right before di mast, plumb dung inna di forecastle, aloft deh to di royal mast-head. True, dem radda order mi bout some, an mek mi jump fram spar to spar, like a grasshopper inna a May meadow. An at first, dis sort a ting nuh pleasant enough. It touch one's sense a honor, particularly if yuh come a one old established family inna di lan, di Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. An more dan all, if jus before yuh put yuh han inna di tar-pot, yuh did a lord it as a country schoolmaster, mek di tallest bwoy dem stan op inna awe a yuh. Di transition a one keen one, mi assure yuh, fram a schoolmaster to a sailor, an it need a strong decoction a Seneca an di Stoics fi mek yuh can grin an bear it. But even dis wear off inna time.</p>
<p>Wat bout it, if some ole hunks a sea-captain order mi fi get a broom an sweep dung di decks? Weh dat deh indignity amount to, weighed, mi mean, inna di scales a di New Testament? Yuh tink di archangel Gabriel tink anyting di less a mi, cause mi promptly an respectfully obey dat deh old hunks inna dat deh particular instance? A uu a no sliev? Tel mi dat. Well, den, however di ole sea-captains dem may order mi bout—however dem may thump an punch mi bout, mi have di satisfaction fi know seh it all right; dat everybody else is one way or other served in much di same way—either inna a physical or metaphysical point a view, dat is; an so di universal thump pass round, an all hands shuda rub each other shoulda-blades, an be content.</p>
<p>Again, mi always go a sea as a sailor, cause dem mek a point a pay mi fi mi trouble, whereas dem neva pay passengers a single penny weh mi eva hear bout. Pan di contrary, passengers demself haffi pay. An a all di difference deh inna di worl between paying an get paid. Di act a paying is perhaps di most uncomfortable infliction weh di two orchard thieves entail upon wi. But <i>being paid</i> ,—weh ago compare wid it? Di urbane activity wid weh a man get money is really marvellous, considering seh wi so earnestly believe money a di root a all earthly ills, an dat pan no account a monied man can enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully wi consign wiself to perdition!</p>
<p>Finally, mi always go a sea as a sailor, because a di wholesome exercise an pure air a di fore-castle deck. For as inna dis ya worl, head winds dem far more prevalent dan winds fram astern (dat is, if yuh neva violate di Pythagorean maxim), so fi di most part di Commodore pan di quarter-deck get him atmosphere at second hand fram di sailors dem pan di forecastle. Him tink him breath it first; but not so. Inna di same way di commonalty dem lead dem leaders inna many ada tings, at di same time dat di leaders dem likkle suspect it. But why it was dat afta mi repeatedly smelt di sea as a merchant sailor, mi shuda now tek it inna mi head fi go pan a whaling voyage; dis a di invisible police officer a di Fates, weh have di constant surveillance a mi, an secretly dog ​​mi, an influence mi inna some unaccountable way—im can better ansa dan any one else. An, doubtless, mi going pan dis whaling voyage, did form part a di grand program a Providence weh did draw up a long time ago. It come in as a sort a brief interlude an solo between more extensive performances. Mi tek it seh dis part a di bill mus did run someting like dis:</p>
<p>“ <i>Grand Contested Election fi di Presidency a di United States.</i> “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”</p>
<p>Though mi cyan tell why it was exactly dat dem stage managers, di Fates, put mi dung fi dis shabby part a one whaling voyage, wen others did set dung fi magnificent parts inna high tragedies, an short an easy parts inna genteel comedies, an jolly parts inna farces—though mi cyan tell why dis was exactly; yet, now dat mi memba all di circumstances, mi tink mi can see likkle inna di springs an motives weh dem did a cunningly present to mi unda various disguises, induce mi fi set bout performing di part weh mi did do, besides cajoling mi inna di delusion seh it was a choice resulting fram mi own unbiased freewill an discriminating judgment.</p>
<p>Chief among dem motives deh was di overwhelming idea a di great whale himself. Such a portentous an mysterious monster roused all mi curiosity. Den di wild an distant seas weh him roll him island bulk; di undeliverable, nameless perils a di whale; dem, wid all di attending marvels a a thousand Patagonian sights an sounds, help fi sway mi to mi wish. Wid ada man, perhaps, such tings wouldn't have been inducements; bot az fi mi, mi a sofa wid wahn evalastin itch fi tingz we de faar. Mi love fi sail forbidden seas, an land pan barbarous coasts. Not ignoring weh good, mi quick fi perceive a horror, an coulda still be social wid it—would dem let mi—since it is but well fi be pan friendly terms wid all di inmates a di place one lodges inna.</p>
<p>By reason a dem ting deh, den, di whaling voyage did welcome; di great flood-gates a di wonder-world swing open, an inna di wild conceits weh sway mi to mi purpose, two an two deh float inna mi inmost soul, endless processions a di whale, an, mid most a dem all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill inna di air.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00007">CHAPTER 2. Di Carpet-Bag.</h2>
<p>Mi stuff a shirt or two inna mi ole carpet-bag, tuck it unda mi arm, an staat fi Cape Horn an di Pacific. Wen mi lef di good city a old Manhatto, mi duly arrive inna New Bedford. A did a Saturday night inna December. Much mi did disappoint wen mi laan seh di likkle packet fi Nantucket did already sail, an seh no way fi reach dat deh place woulda offer, til di following Monday.</p>
<p>As most young candidates fi di pains an penalties a whaling stop at dis same New Bedford, deh fi embark pan dem voyage, it may as well be related dat mi, fi one, neva have no idea of ​​so doing. For mi mind did mek up fi sail inna no ada dan a Nantucket craft, cause deh did have a fine, boisterous someting bout everyting weh did connect wid dat deh famous old island, weh amazingly pleased mi. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolize the business of whaling, and though in dis matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind har, yet Nantucket was har great original—di Tire of dis Carthage;—di place weh di first dead American whale did stranded. Weh else but fram Nantucket dem deh aboriginal whalemen, di Red-Men, did fos sally out inna canoes fi gi chase to di Leviathan? An weh but fram Nantucket, too, did dat deh fos adventurous likkle sloop put out, partly laden wid imported cobblestones—so go di story—fi throw at di whales, fi discover wen dem did nigh enough fi risk a harpoon fram di bowsprit?</p>
<p>Now having a night, a day, an still anodda night a follow before mi inna New Bedford, ere mi coulda embark fi mi destined port, it became a matter a concern weh mi was fi eat an sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark an dismal night, bitingly cold an cheerless. Mi neva know nobadi inna di place. Wid anxious grapnels mi did sound mi pocket, an only bring up a few pieces a silver,—So, weh yuh go, Ishmael, seh mi to miself, as mi did a stan up inna di middle a one dreary street a shoulder mi bag, an a compare di gloom towards di north wid di darkness towards di south—wehweh inna yuh widdom may fi conclude mi night, dear Ishmael, mek sure yuh inquire di price, an don't be too particular.</p>
<p>Wid halting steps mi pace di streets, an pass di sign a “The Crossed Harpoons”—but it look too expensive an jolly deh. Further on, fram di bright red windows a di “Sword-Fish Inn,” deh did come such fervent rays, dat it did look like it did melt di packed snow an ice fram before di house, fi everyweh else di congealed frost did deh ten inches thick inna a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary fi mi, wen mi did a struck against mi foot, cause haad, project remorseless service di soles a mi boots dem did inna a most miserable plight. Too expensive an jolly, again mi tink, pausing one moment fi watch di broad glare inna di street, an hear di sounds a di tinkling glasses widin. But go on, Ishmael, mi seh at last; unu no ier? get weh fram before di door; yuh patched boots dem a stop di way. So on mi goh. Mi now by instinct follow di streets dem weh tek mi waterward, fi deh, doubtless, was di cheapest, if not di cheeriest inns.</p>
<p>Such dreary streets! blocks a blackness, not houses, pan either han, an yah an deh a candle, like a candle a move bout inna a tomb. At dis hour a di night, a di last day a di week, dat deh quarter a di town did prove all but deserted. But presently mi come to a smoky light proceeding fram a low, wide building, di door a weh did stan invitingly open. It did have a careless look, as if it did mean fi di uses a di public; so, wen mi did a enter, di first ting mi did do was fi stumble ova an ash-box inna di porch. Ha! mi did tink, ha, as di flying particles almost choke mi, dem ashes deh fram dat deh destroyed city, Gomorrah? But “Di Crossed Harpoons,” an “Di Sword-Fish?”—dis, den mus need fi be di sign a “Di Trap.” However, mi pick miself up an hear a loud voice widin, push on an open a secan, interior door.</p>
<p>It did look like di great Black Parliament did a sidong inna Tophet. A hundred black faces turn round inna dem rows fi peer; an beyond, a black Angel of Doom did a beat a book inna a pulpit. A did a negro church; an di preacher's text did bout di blackness a darkness, an di weeping an wailing an teet-gnashing deh. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at di sign a 'The Trap!'</p>
<p>Moving on, mi at last come to a dim sort a light not far fram di docks, an hear a forlorn creaking inna di air; an look up, si a swinging sign ova di door wid a white painting pan it, faintly representing a tall straight jet a misty spray, an dem words deh unda it—“Di Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”</p>
<p>Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous inna dat deh particular connexion, thought mi. But it a one common name inna Nantucket, dem seh, an mi suppose dis Peter yah a one emigrant fram deh. As di light did look so dim, an di place, fi di time, did look quiet enough, an di dilapidated likkle wooden house itself did look as if it mighta did get cart yah fram di ruins a some burnt district, an as di swinging sign did have a poverty-stricken sort a creak to it, mi did tink seh yah was di very spot fi cheap lodging, an di bes a coffee.</p>
<p>A did a queer sort a place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were, an leaning ova sadly. It did stan op pan a shaap bleak corner, weh dat deh tempestuous wind Euroclydon did a keep up a worse howling dan eva it did bout poor Paul's tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, a one mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, wid him foot dem pan di hob quietly toasting fi bed. “In judging of dat deh tempestuous wind weh dem call Euroclydon,” seh an old writer—of whose works mi possess di only copy extant—“it mek a marvelous difference, weda yuh look out pan it fram a glass window weh di frost deh pan di outside, or weda yuh observe it fram dat deh sashless window, weh di both sides an Death deh pan di wight a di ongl glazier.” True enough, mi did tink, as dis passage did come to mi mind—old black-letter, yuh reasonest well. Yes, dem eyes yah a windows, an dis body a mi a di house. Wat a pity dem neva stop up di chinks an di crannies dem though, an thrust in a likkle lint yah an deh. But it too late fi mek any improvements now. Di universe don; di copestone deh on, an di chips dem did cart off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus deh deh, a chatter him teet dem against di curbstone fi him pillow, an a shake off him tatters wid him shiverings, him coulda plug up both ears wid rags, an put a corn-cob inna him mout, an yet dat woulda neva keep out di tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! seh uol Dives, inna him red silken wrapper—(im did have a redder one aftawards) pooh, pooh! Wat a fine frosty night; how Orion glitter; weh northern lights! Mek dem talk bout dem oriental summer climes a everlasting conservatories; gi mi di privilege fi mek mi own summer wid mi own coals.</p>
<p>But weh Lazarus tink? Him can warm him blue han dem by holding dem up to di grand northern lights? Lazarus wouldn't radda deh inna Sumatra dan yah? If him wouldn't far rather lay him dung lengthwise along di line a di equator; yes, unu gad dem! go dung to di fiery pit itself, fi keep out dis frost?</p>
<p>Now, dat Lazarus shuda lie stranded deh pan di curbstone before di door a Dives, dis a more wonderful dan dat an iceberg shuda moor to one a di Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, him too live like a Czar inna an ice palace mek outa frozen sighs, an being a president a one temperance society, him only drink di tepid tears a orphans.</p>
<p>But no more a dis blubbering now, wi a go a-whaling, an plenty a dat deh yet fi come. Mek wi scrape di ice fram wi frosted feet dem, an si weh sort a place dis “Spouter” maita bi.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00008">CHAPTER 3. Di Spouter-Inn.</h2>
<p>Entering dat gable-ended Spouter-Inn, yuh find yuhself inna a wide, low, straggling entry wid old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one a di bulwarks a some condemned old craft. Pan one side did a hang a very big oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, an every way defaced, dat inna di unequal crosslights by which yuh did a view it, it was only by diligent study an a series a systematic visits to it, an careful inquiry of di neighbors, dat yuh coulda any way arrive at an understanding of it purpose. Such unaccountable masses a shades an shadows, dat at first yuh almost tink some ambitious young artist, inna di time a di New England hags, did endeavour fi delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint a much an earnest contemplation, an oft repeated ponderings, an especially by throwing open di likkle window towards di back a di entry, yuh at last come to di conclusion dat such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.</p>
<p>But weh did most puzzle an confound yuh was a long, limber, portentous, black mass a someting weh did a hover inna di center a di picture ova three blue, dim, perpendicular lines weh did a float inna a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough fi drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was deh a sort a indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity bout it weh fairly froze yuh to it, til yuh involuntarily tek an oath wid yuhself fi find out weh dat deh marvelous painting mean. Ever an anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea woulda dart yuh through.—It's di Black Sea inna a midnight gale.—It's di unnatural combat a di four primal elements.—It's a blasted heath.—It's a Hyperborean winter scene.—It's di breaking-up a di ice boundstream a Time. But at last all dem fancies yah yield to dat deh one portentous someting inna di picture's midst. <i>Dat</i> once did find out, an all di rest did plain. But stop; it nuh bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even di great leviathan himself?</p>
<p>In fact, di artist's design did look dis: a final theory a mi own, partly based pan di aggregated opinions a many aged persons wid whom mi did a converse pan di subject. Di picture represent a Cape-Horner inna a great hurricane; di half-foundered ship weh did a welter deh wid it three dismantled masts alone visible; an wan exasperated whale, purposing fi spring clean ova di craft, deh inna di enormous act a impaling himself upon di three mast-heads.</p>
<p>Di opposite wall a dis entry did hang all ova wid a heathenish array a monstrous clubs an spears. Som a dem did thickly set wid glittering teet weh look like ivory saws; ada ones did tufted wid knots a human hair; an one was sickle-shaped, wid a vast handle sweeping round like di segment weh mek inna di new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. Yuh shiek as yuh did a look, an did a wanda weh monstrous cannibal an savage coulda eva go a death-harvesting wid such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed wid dem deh was rusty old whaling lances an harpoons all broken an deformed. Some a dem was storied weapons. Wid dis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise an a sunset. An dat deh harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—weh fling inna Javan seas, an run weh wid by a whale, years aftawards slain off di Cape of Blanco. Di original iron did enter nigh di tail, an, like a restless needle sojourning inna di body a one man, travel full forty feet, an at last dem did find imbedded inna di hump.</p>
<p>Crossing dis dusky entry, an on thru yon low-arched way—cut thru weh inna old times must have been a great central chimney wid fireplaces all round—yuh enter di public room. A still duskier place is dis, wid such low ponderous beams above, an such old wrinkled planks beath, dat yuh woulda almost fancy yuh trod some old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, wen dis corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. Pan one side did a stan op a lang, low, shelf-like table weh did cover wid cracked glass cases, full a dusty rarities weh did gather fram dis wide world's remotest nooks. Projecting fram di further angle a di room stan a dark-looking den—di bar—a rude attempt at a right whale's head. Be dat how it may, deh stan di vast arched bone a di whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beath it. Widin deh deh shabby shelves, ranged round wid old decanters, bottles, flasks; an inna dem jaws a swift destruction, like anodda cursed Jonah (by which name indeed dem did call him), bustles a likkle withered old man, who, fi dem money, dearly sell di sailors deliriums an death.</p>
<p>Abominable are di tumblers dem weh him pour him poison inna. Though true cylinders widout—within, di villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely pecked inna di glass, surround dem footpads' goblets. Fill to <i>dis</i> mark, an yuh charge is only a penny; to <i>dis</i> a penny more; an so on to di full glass—di Cape Horn measure, weh yuh can gulp dung fi a shilling.</p>
<p>Wen mi go inna di place mi find a nomba a young seamen dem did a gather roun a table, a examine by a dim light divers specimens a <i>skrimshander</i> . Mi did a look fi di landlord, an tell him seh mi did waan be accommodated wid a room, an mi get fi ansa seh him house did full—not a bed unoccupied. “But avast,” him added, tapping him forehead, “yuh haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket, have yuh? Mi s'pose yuh a goin' a-whalin', so yuh better get used to dat deh sort a ting.”</p>
<p>Mi tell him seh mi neva like fi sleep two inna a bed; dat if mi shuda eva do so, it woulda depend pan who di harpooneer might be, an dat if him (di landlord) really neva have no ada place fi mi, an di harpooneer neva decidedly objectionable, why rather dan wander further bout a strange town pan so bitter a night, mi woulda put up wid di half a any decent man's blanket.</p>
<p>“Mi did tink so. All right; tek a seat. Supper?—yuh waan supper? Supper ago ready directly.”</p>
<p>Mi sidong pan wahn uol wudn setl, kaav aal uova laik wahn bench pan di Bachri. At one end a ruminating tar did still a adorn it wid him jack-knife, stooping ova an diligently working weh at di space between him legs. Im did a try im han pan a ship anda full sail, but im neva mek much headway, mi did tink.</p>
<p>At last some four or five a wi did get summon fi wi meal inna one adjoining room. It did kuol laik Iislan—no faiya at aal—di lanlaad se im kudn aafa it. Notn but two dismal tallow candles, each inna a winding sheet. Wi did fain fi button up wi monkey jackets, an hold to wi lips cups a scalding tea wid wi half frozen fingers. But di fare was a di most substantial kind—not only meat an potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings fi supper! One young fellow inna a green box coat, address himself to dem dumplings inna a most direful manner.</p>
<p>“Mi bwai,” di lanlaad se, “yu wi av di naitmare tu wahn ded sartainty.”</p>
<p>“Landlord,” mi whispered, “dat aint di harpooneer is it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” him seh, looking a sort a diabolically funny, “di harpooneer a one dark complexioned chap. Him neva eat dumplings, him nuh—im eat nutten but steaks, an him like 'em rare.”</p>
<p>“Di devil him do,” mi seh. “We dat deh harpooneer deh? Him deh yah?”</p>
<p>“Im ago deh yah afore long,” was di ansa.</p>
<p>Mi couldn't help it, but mi staat feel suspicious a dis “dark complexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, mi mek up mi mind seh if it so turn out seh we shuda sleep tugeda, him haffi undress an go inna bed before mi did.</p>
<p>Supper ova, di company go back to di bar-room, wen, knowing not weh else fi do wid miself, mi resolve fi spen di rest a di evening as a looker pan.</p>
<p>Presently a rioting noise did hear widout. Staatin op, di lanlaad baal out, "Dat a di Grampus kruu. Mi si ar ripuot ina di offing dis maanin; a chrii ier voyage, an a ful ship. Hurrah, bwai; nou wi a go av di laas nyuuz fram di Feegees."</p>
<p>Dem hear a tramping a sea boots inna di entry; di door did fling open, an inna roll a wild set a mariners enough. Enveloped inna dem shaggy watch coats, an wid dem head muffled inna woolen comforters, all bedarned an ragged, an dem beards stiff wid icicles, dem did look like an eruption a bears fram Labrador. Dem did jus land fram dem boat, an dis a di first house dem did go inna. No wanda, den, seh dem mek a straight wake fi di whale's mout—di bar—wen di wrinkled likkle old Jonah, deh officiating, soon pour dem out brimmers all round. One complain bout a bad cold inna him head, pan which Jonah mix him a pitch-like potion a gin an molasses, weh him swore was a sovereign cure fi all colds an catarrhs ​​whatsoever, neva mind a how long standing, or weda dem ketch off di coast a Labrador, or pan di weather side a an ice-island.</p>
<p>Di liquor soon mount inna dem head, as it generally do even wid di arrantest topers newly landed fram sea, an dem staat capering bout most obstreperously.</p>
<p>Mi observe, however, seh one a dem did hold somewhat aloof, an though him did look like him did waan not spoil di hilarity a him shipmates by him own sober face, yet pan di whole him refrain fram mek as much noise as di rest. Dis man did intres mi at once; an since di sea-gods dem did ordain seh him shuda soon become mi shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as dis narrative is concerned), mi ago yah venture upon a likkle description a him. Im did a stan up full six feet in height, wid noble shoulders, an a chest like a coffer-dam. Mi neva si such brawn inna a man. Him face did deeply brown an burnt, mek him white teet dem dazzling by di contrast; while inna di deep shadows a him eyes did a float some reminiscences weh neva did a gi him much joy. Him voice at once announce seh him a one Southerner, an fram him fine stature, mi did tink him mus be one a dem tall mountaineers fram di Alleghanian Ridge inna Virginia. Wen di revelry a him companions did mount to its height, dis man slip weh unobserved, an mi neva see him more til him become mi comrade pan di sea. Inna a few minutes, however, him did miss by him shipmates, an being, it seems, fi some reason a huge favorite wid dem, dem raise a cry a “Bulkington! Bulkington! weh Bulkington deh?” an ron outa di ous fi fala im.</p>
<p>A did now bout nine o'clock, an di room did a look almost supernaturally quiet afta dem orgies yah, mi staat fi congratulate miself pan a likkle plan weh did happen to mi jus before di entrance a di seamen dem.</p>
<p>No man no prefer fi sleep two inna a bed. In fak, yu wuda a gud diil raada no sliip wid yu uona breda. Mi no nuo ou it go, bot piipl laik fi de praivit wen dem a sliip. An wen it come to sleeping wid an unknown stranger, inna a strange inn, inna a strange town, an dat deh stranger a harpooneer, den yuh objections indefinitely multiply. No earthly reason neva deh deh fi mek mi as a sailor sleep two inna a bed, more dan anybody else; fi sailors no more sleep two inna a bed at sea, dan bachelor Kings do ashore. Fi mek sure dem all sleep tugeda inna one apartment, but yuh have yuh own hammock, an cover yuhself wid yuh own blanket, an sleep inna yuh own skin.</p>
<p>Di more mi did a tink bout dis harpooneer, di more mi did a abominate di thought a sleeping wid him. It was fair fi presume seh being a harpooneer, him linen or woollen, as di case might be, wouldn't be a di tidiest, certainly none a di finest. Mi staat twitch all ova. Besides, it did a get late, an mi decent harpooneer shuda deh home an a go bedwards. Suppose now, him shuda tumble in pan mi at midnight—how mi coulda tell fram weh vile hole him did a come?</p>
<p>“Landlord! Mi change mi mind bout dat deh harpooneer.—Mi naa go sleep wid him. Mi ago try di bench yah.”</p>
<p>“Just as yuh please; mi sorry mi cyan spare yuh a tablecloth fi a mattress, an a plaguy rough board yah”—feeling a di knots an notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; mi have a carpenter's plane deh inna di bar—wait, mi seh, an mi wi mek yuh snug enough.” So seh him procure di plane; an wid him ole silk handkerchief fos a dusting di bench, vigorously set to planing weh at mi bed, di while grinning like an ape. Di shavings dem fly right an left; til at last di plane-iron come bump against an indestructible knot. Di landlord did near sprain him wrist, an mi tell him fi heaven's sake fi quit—di bed did soft enough fi suit mi, an mi neva know how all di planing inna di worl coulda mek eider dung a one pine plank. So gathering up di shavings wid anodda grin, an throw dem inna di great stove inna di middle a di room, him go bout him business, an lef mi inna a brown study.</p>
<p>Mi tek di measure a di bench now, an find out seh it was a foot too short; but dat coulda be mended wid a chair. But it did a foot too narrow, an di ada bench inna di room did bout four inches higher dan di planed one—so dem neva have no yoking dem. Den mi put di fos bench lengthwise along di ongl clear space gens di wall, lef a likl interval bitwiin, fi mi bak fi settle dong inna. Bot mi suun fain out se a soch a draft a kuol ier kom ova mi fram anda di sill a di winda, dat dis plan wudn eva du at aal, espeshali az wan neda korant fram di rickety duor miit di wan fram di winda, an di tuu a dem faam tugeda ina di likl winda dem siem taim vicinity a di spot weh mi did tink fi spen di nait.</p>
<p>Di devil fetch dat deh harpooneer, mi did tink, but stop, couldn't mi steal a march pan him—bolt him door inside, an jump inna him bed, not fi be wakened by di most violent knockings? It did look like a nuh bad idea; but pan second thoughts mi dismiss it. For who coulda tell but weh di next morning, so soon as mi pop out a di room, di harpooneer might be standing inna di entry, all ready fi knock mi dung!</p>
<p>Stil, mi a luk roun mi agen, an a si no chaans fi spen a sofarin nait ef mi no de ina som ada smadi bed, mi staat fi tingk se afta aal mi maita a cherish unwarrantable prejudices gens dis unknown harpooneer. Mi tink, mi ago wait a wail; him mosi a drop in before long. Mi ago have a good look pon him den, an perhaps wi may become jolly good bedfellows afta all—no telling.</p>
<p>But though di ada boarders dem did a come in by one, two, an three, an a goh bed, yet no sign a mi harpooneer.</p>
<p>“Landlord!” mi seh, “weh sort a chap him is—im always keep such late hours?” It did aad now pan twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>Di landlord chuckle again wid him lean chuckle, an him did look like him did a tickle at someting beyond mi comprehension. “No,” him ansa, “generally him a one early bird—airley to bed an airley to rise—yes, him a di bird weh catch di worm. But to-night him go out a peddling, yuh see, an mi nuh see weh pan airth keep him so late, unless, may be, him can't sell him head.”</p>
<p>“Chan't sell him head?—Weh sort a bamboozingly story dis yuh a tell mi?” get inna a towering rage. “Yuh pretend fi seh, landlord, seh dis harpooneer is actually engaged dis blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, inna peddling him head roun dis town?”</p>
<p>“A dat preshos,” di lanlaad se, “an mi tel im se im kudn sel it ya, di maakit uovastok.”</p>
<p>“Wid weh?” mi baal out.</p>
<p>“Wid ed fi shuor, no tuu moch ed de iina di worl?”</p>
<p>“Mi tell yuh weh it is, landlord,” seh mi quite calmly, “yuh beta stop spin dat deh yarn to mi—mi no green.”</p>
<p>“May be not,” tek out a stick an whittling a toothpick, “but mi raither guess yuh ago don <i>brown</i> if dat deh ere harpooneer hear yuh a slanderin' him head.”</p>
<p>“Mi ago break it fi him,” mi seh, now a fly inna a passion again at dis unaccountable farrago a di landlord's.</p>
<p>“It brok op aredi,” im se.</p>
<p>“Broke,” seh mi—“ <i>broke</i> , yuh mean?”</p>
<p>“Sartain, an a dat mek him cyaan sell it, mi guess.”</p>
<p>“Lanlaad,” mi se, a go op tu im az kuol az Mt. Hecla ina wahn sno-staam—“lanlaad, stap whittling. Yu an mi afi andastan wan aneda, an dat tu widout diil. Mi kom a yu yaad an waahn wan bed; yu tel mi se yu kyan onggl gi mi aaf a wan; se di ada aaf bilang tu wan sertn harpooneer. An bout dis harpooneer, uu mi no si yet, mi no si yu yet. inna telling mi di most mystifying an exasperating stories tending to beget inna mi an uncomfortable feeling towards di man whom yuh design fi mi bedfellow—a sort a connexion, landlord, weh a one intimate an confidential one inna di highest degree mi now demand a yuh fi speak out an tell mi who an weh dis harpooneer is, an weda mi shall be in safe wid di sight. him. An inna di fos place, yuh ago be so good as fi unsay dat deh story bout selling him head, weh if true mi tek fi be good evidence seh dis harpooneer is stark mad, an mi no have no idea of ​​sleeping wid a madman, <i>yuh</i> , <i>sir</i> , by trying fi induce mi fi do so knowing, deh woulda render yuhself a crial crial.”</p>
<p>“Wall,” seh di lanlaad, a tek a lang breath, “dat a wan purty lang sarmon fi a chap weh rip a likl nou an den. But be easy, be easy, dis ya harpooneer mi a tel yu bout jos kom fram di south seas, weh im bai op a lat a 'balmed New Zealand heads (great curios'), an sold aal a dem one, an dat deh one him a try sell to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, an it wouldn't do fi be sellin' human heads bout di streets wen folks a goin' to churches Him did waan, last Sunday, but mi stop him jus as him did a goin' outa di door wid four heads string pan a string, fi all di air like a string.”</p>
<p>Dis account clear up di otherwise unaccountable mystery, an show seh di landlord, afta all, neva have no idea a fool mi—but at di same time weh mi coulda tink bout a harpooneer weh did stay outa a Saturday night clean into di holy Sabbath, engaged inna such a cannibal business as selling di heads a dead idolators?</p>
<p>“Dipen pan it, landlord, dat deh harpooneer a one dangerous man.”</p>
<p>“Im pay reg'lar,” was di rejoinder. “But come, it a get dreadful late, yuh woulda better be turning flukes—it's a nice bed; Sal an mi did sleep inna dat deh ere bed di night we did a splice. Deh deh plenty a room fi two fi kick bout inna dat deh bed; a one almighty big bed dat. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put inna wi likkle John and John fony But I got a fony. dreaming an sprawling bout one night, an somehow, Sam get pitch pan di floor, an come near breaking him arm Arter dat, Sal seh it wouldn't do Come along yah, mi ago gi yuh a glim inna a jiffy;” an so seh him light a candle an hold it towards mi, offering fi lead di way. But mi did stan up irresolute; wen him look pon a clock inna di corner, him exclaim “Mi vum it's Sunday—yuh naa go see dat deh harpooneer to-night; him come fi anchor somewhere—come along den; <i>do</i> come; <i>won't</i> yuh come?”</p>
<p>Mi consider di matter a moment, an den up stairs wi go, an dem did a usher mi inna a likkle room, cold as a clam, an furnished, sure enough, wid a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed fi any four harpooneers fi sleep abreast.</p>
<p>“Deh,” seh di landlord, an put di candle pan a crazy ole sea chest weh did a do double duty as a wash-stand an center table; “deh, mek yuhself comfortable now, an good night to yuh.” Mi turn roun fram eyeing di bed, but him did disappear.</p>
<p>Folding back di counterpane, mi stoop ova di bed. Though none a di most elegant, it yet did stan di scrutiny tolerably well. Mi den look roun di room; an besides di bedstead an center table, coulda see no ada furniture belonging to di place, but a rude shelf, di four walls, an a papered fireboard weh did a represent a man a strike a whale. A tings weh neva belong to di room, deh did have a hammock weh did lash up, an did fling pan di floor inna one corner; also a big seaman's bag, containing di harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu a one land trunk. Likewise, deh did have a parcel a outlandish bone fish hooks pan di shelf ova di fire-place, an a tall harpoon did a stan op a di head a di bed.</p>
<p>But weh dis deh pan di chest? Mi tek it op, an hold it close to di light, an feel it, an smel it, an try every way possible fi arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. Mi can compare it to notn but a big door mat, ornamented at di edges wid likkle tinkling tags someting like di stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. A did a hole or slit inna di middle a dis mat, as yuh see di same inna South American ponchos. But it coulda be possible dat any sober harpooneer woulda get inna a door mat, an parade di streets a any Christian town inna dat deh sort a guise? Mi put it on, fi try it, an it weigh mi dung like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy an thick, an mi did tink a likkle damp, as if dis mysterious harpooneer did a wear it a rainy day. Mi go op inna it to a bit a glass weh stick gens di wall, an mi neva si such a sight inna mi life. Mi tere miself outa it inna such a hurry dat mi give miself a kink inna di neck.</p>
<p>Mi sidong pan di side a di bed, an staat tink bout dis head-peddling harpooneer, an him door mat. Afta mi tink som taim pan di bed-said, mi get op an tek aaf mi monki jakit, an den tan op inna di migl a di ruum a tink. Mi den tek aaf mi coat, an tink likkle more inna mi shirt sleeves. But staatin fi feel very cold now, half undressed as mi did, an memba weh di landlord seh bout di harpooneer's not coming home at all dat deh night, it being so very late, mi mek no more ado, but jump outa mi pantaloons an boots, an den blowing out di light tumbled inna bed, an commend miself to di care a heaven.</p>
<p>Weda dat deh mattress did full a corn-cobs or broken crockery, yuh can know, but mi roll bout a good deal, an couldn't sleep fi a long time. At last mi slid off inna a light doze, an did pretty nearly mek a good offing towards di lan a Nod, wen mi hear a heavy footfall inna di passage, an si a glimmer a light come inna di room fram unda di door.</p>
<p>Lord save mi, mi tink, dat mus be di harpooneer, di infernal head-peddler. Bot mi did a lidong stil, an mi did mek op mi main se mi naa go se a wod til dem taak tu mi. Holding a light inna one han, an dat deh identical New Zealand head inna di ada, di stranger go inna di room, an widout looking towards di bed, put him candle a good way off fram mi pan di floor inna one corner, an den staat work weh at di knotted cords a di big bag weh mi did a taak bout before as being inna di room. Mi did all eagerness fi si him face, but him kip it averted fi some time wile him did a unlace di bag's mout. Dis accomplish, however, him turn round—wen, good heavens! wat a sight! Such a face! It was a dark, purplish, yellow colour, yah an deh stick ova wid big blackish looking squares. Yes, a jus as mi did tink, him a one terrible bedfellow; him did inna a fight, get dreadfully cut, an yah him deh, jus fram di surgeon. But at dat moment deh him chance fi turn him face so towards di light, dat mi plainly si dem couldn't be sticking-plasters at all, dem black squares deh pan him cheeks. Dem was stains a some sort or other. At first mi neva know weh fi mek a dis; but soon an inkling a di truth come to mi. Mi memba a story bout a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling mongst di cannibals, did get tattooed by dem. Mi conclude seh dis harpooneer, inna di course a him distant voyages, mosi did meet wid a similar adventure. An weh it is, mi did tink, afta all! A ongl fi him outside; a man can be honest inna any sort a skin. But den, weh fi mek a him unearthly complexion, dat deh part a it, mi mean, lay round bout, an completely independent a di squares a tattooing. Fi be sure, it might be notn but a good coat a tropical tanning; but mi neva hear bout a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, mi neva did deh inna di South Seas; an perhaps di sun deh did produce dem deh extraordinary effects pan di skin. Now, while all dem ideas deh did a pass thru mi like lightning, dis harpooneer neva notice mi at all. But, afta some difficulty having opening him bag, him staat fumbling inna it, an presently pull out a sort a tomahawk, an a seal-skin wallet wid di hair on. Put dem pan di uol chest inna di middle a di room, den tek di New Zealand head—a ghastly ting enough—an cram it dung inna di bag. Im now tek off im hat—a new beaver hat—wen mi come nigh a sing out wid fresh surprise. No hair neva deh pan him head—none fi speak bout at least—nothing but a likkle scalp-knot twist up pan him forehead. Him bald purplish head now look fi all di worl like a mildewed skull. If di stranger neva did deh between mi an di door, mi woulda bolt outa it quicker dan eva mi bolt a dinner.</p>
<p>Even as it was, mi did tink someting bout slip outa di window, but it was di secan floor back. Mi a nuh coward, but weh fi mek a dis head-peddling purple rascal altogether pass mi comprehension. Ignorance a di parent a fear, an being completely nonplussed an confounded bout di stranger, mi confess mi did now as much fraid a him as if it was di devil himself weh did so break inna mi room at di dead a night. In fact, mi did so fraid a him dat mi neva game enough jus den fi address him, an demand a satisfactory ansa concerning weh did look inexplicable inna him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, him continue di business a undressing, an at last show him chest an arms. As mi live, dem covered parts a him did checkered wid di same squares as him face; him back, too, did all ova di same dark squares; him did look like him did deh inna a Thirty Years' War, an jus escape fram it wid a sticking-plaster shirt. Stil more, him very legs dem did mark, as if a parcel a dark green frogs did a run up di trunks a young palms. It was now quite plain seh him mus be some abominable savage or other shiped aboard of a whaleman inna di South Seas, an so land inna dis Christian country. Mi shiek fi tink bout it. A peddler a heads too—perhaps di heads a him own bredda dem. Him might tek a fancy to mine—heavens! look pon dat deh tomahawk!</p>
<p>But it neva have no time fi shuddering, fi now di savage did a go bout someting weh completely fascinate mi attention, an convince mi seh him mus indeed be a heathen. Going to him heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, weh him did hang pan a chair before, him fumble inna di pockets, an produce at length a curious likkle deformed image wid a hunch pan it back, an exactly di color a one three days' old Congo baby. Wen mi memba di embalmed head, at first mi did almost tink seh dis black manikin was a real baby preserved inna some similar manner. But wen mi si seh it neva limber at all, an it did a glisten a good deal like polished ebony, mi conclude seh it mus be notn but a wooden idol, weh indeed it prove fi be. Fi now di savage go up to di empty fire-place, an tek weh di papered fire-board, set op dis likkle hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between di andirons. Di chimney jambs an all di bricks dem inside did very sooty, so dat mi did tink dis fire-place mek a very appropriate likkle shrine or chapel fi him Congo idol.</p>
<p>Mi now screwed mi eyes hard towards di half hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime—fi see weh was next to follow. Fos him tek bout a double handful a shavings outa him grego pocket, an put dem carefully before di idol; den lay a bit a ship biscuit pan tap an apply di flame fram di lamp, him kindle di shavings dem inna a sacrificial blaze. Presently, afta plenty hasty snatches inna di fire, an still hastier withdrawals a him finga dem (whereby him did look like him did a scorching dem badly), him at last succeed inna drawing out di biscuit; den blowing off di heat an ashes likkle, him mek a polite offer a it to di likkle negro. But di likkle devil neva did a fancy such dry sort a fare at all; him neva move him lips. All dem strange antics deh did a come wid still stranger guttural noises fram di devotee, weh did a look like him did a pray inna a sing-song or else a sing some pagan psalmody or other, during which him face did a twitch bout inna di most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing di fire, him tek di idol up very unceremoniously, an bag it again inna him grego pocket as carelessly as if him was a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.</p>
<p>All dem queer proceedings increase mi uncomfortableness, an seeing him now a exhibit strong symptoms a concluding him business operations, an a jump inna bed wid mi, mi tink seh a did high time, now or neva, before di light did put out, fi break di spell inna weh mi did so long been bound.</p>
<p>But di interval mi spen a deliberate weh fi seh, was a fatal one. Im tek op im tomahawk fram di tiebl, an luk pan di ed a it fi a likl wail, an den uol it tu di lait, wid im mout a di han, im puff out big kloud a tobaako sumuok. Di neks moment di light did extinguish, an dis wild cannibal, tomahawk between him teet, sprang inna bed wid mi. Mi sing out, mi couldn't help it now; an gi a sudden grunt a astonishment him staat feel mi.</p>
<p>Stammering out someting, mi neva know weh, mi roll weh fram him against di wall, an den conjure him, whoever or whatever him might be, fi keep quiet, an mek mi get up an light di lamp again. But him guttural responses satisfy mi at once dat him but ill comprehend mi meaning.</p>
<p>“Who-e debel yuh?”—im at last seh—“yuh no speak-e, dam-mi, mi kill-e.” An so seh di lighted tomahawk staat flourish bout mi inna di dark.</p>
<p>“Landlord, fi God's sake, Peter Coffin!” shout I. “Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save mi!”</p>
<p>“Speak-e! tell-ee mi who-ee be, or dam-mi, mi kill-e!” again growled di cannibal, while him horrid flourishings a di tomahawk scatter di hot tobacco ashes bout mi til mi tink mi linen woulda get on fire. But tank heaven, at dat deh moment di landlord come inna di room light inna han, an jump fram di bed mi run up to him.</p>
<p>“No bada fried nou,” im se, a griin agen, “Kwiequeg ya wudn bad no ier a yu ed.”</p>
<p>“Stop yuh grin,” mi shout, “an why yuh neva tell mi seh dat deh infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”</p>
<p>“Mi did tink yuh did know it;—mi neva tell yuh, him was a peddlin' heads roun town?—but turn flukes again an go sleep. Queequeg, look yah—yuh sabbee mi, mi sabbee—yuh dis man sleepe yuh—yuh sabbee?”</p>
<p>“Mi sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing weh at him pipe an sitting up inna bed.</p>
<p>“Yuh gettee in,” him added, motioning to mi wid him tomahawk, an throw di clothes to one side. Im really do dis inna not only a civil but a really kind an charitable way. Mi stan up a look pon him fi a moment. Fi all him tattooings him was on di whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. Weh all dis fuss mi a mek bout, mi tink to miself—di man a human being jus like mi: him have jus as much reason fi fear mi, as mi haffi be fraid a him. Better sleep wid a sober cannibal dan a drunken Christian.</p>
<p>“Landlord,” mi seh, “tel him fi stash him tomahawk deh, or pipe, or weh yuh call it; tell him fi stop smoke, in short, an mi wi turn in wid him. But mi nuh fancy fi have a man a smoke inna bed wid mi. It's dangerous. Besides, mi ain't insured.”</p>
<p>Dis wen dem did a tell Queequeg, him at once complied, an again politely motion mi fi get inna bed—rolling ova to one side as much as fi seh—“Mi naa go touch a leg a yuh.”</p>
<p>“Gud night, landlord,” seh mi, “yuh can go.”</p>
<p>Mi turn in, an neva sleep betta inna mi life.</p>
