    </h2>
    <p>
       Usuku olwalunqunyelwe kusengaphambili lwafika, futhi ngokufanelekile sahlangana nomkhumbi i-Jungfrau, uDerick De Deer, umphathi, waseBremen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngesinye isikhathi abantu abakhulu kakhulu abadoba imikhomo emhlabeni, amaDashi namaJalimane manje aphakathi kwabancane kakhulu; kodwa lapha nalaphaya ngezikhawu ezibanzi kakhulu ze-latitude ne-longitude, usahlangana ngezikhathi ezithile nefulege labo ePacific.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngasizathu simbe, abakwaJungfrau babonakala bemagange ukumhlonipha. Kuthe kusekude ne-Pequod, wajikela, futhi wehlisa isikebhe, ukaputeni wakhe washukumiseleka ukuba abheke ngakithi, ngokuphelelwa isineke emi eminsalweni esikhundleni sengemuva.

    <p>
       &quot;Uyini lapho ngesandla sakhe?&quot; kumemeza uStarbuck, ekhomba entweni enyakazayo ebanjwe iJalimane. “Akunakwenzeka!—umphakeli wezibani!
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hhayi lokho,” kusho uStubb, “cha, cha, ibhodwe lekhofi, Mnu. Starbuck; uyeza ukuzosenzela ikhofi lethu, nguYarman; awuliboni lelothayela elikhulu lapho eduze kwakhe?—ngamanzi akhe abilayo lawo. O! uyaphila, nguYarman.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hamba nawe,” kumemeza iFlask, “yisiphakeli nesigubhu samafutha. Uphuma emafutheni, futhi uzenzele. &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Nokho kungase kubonakale kuthakazelisa kangakanani ukuthi umkhumbi kawoyela uboleka amafutha emhlabathini womkhomo, futhi noma ngabe kungakanani okungase kuphikisane nesaga esidala sokuthwala amalahle eNewcastle, nokho ngezinye izikhathi into enjalo iyenzeka ngempela; futhi kulesi simo samanje uKaputeni uDerick De Deer uye waqhuba isiphakeli sesibani ngendlela egculisayo njengoba iFlask yasho.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ekukhweleni kwakhe endaweni ephakemeyo, u-Ahabi wamhlangabeza, engazange alalele nakancane lokho ayenakho esandleni sakhe; kodwa ngolimi lwakhe oluphukile, umJalimane ngokushesha wabonisa ukungazi kwakhe ngokuphelele uMkhomo Omhlophe; ngokushesha ephendulela ingxoxo emshinini wakhe wokuphakela izibani kanye nekani likawoyela, ngamazwi athile athinta ukuthi kufanele ajike abe yindlu yakhe yokulala ebusuku ebumnyameni obukhulu—iconsi lakhe lokugcina likawoyela weBremen lingasekho, futhi akukho neyodwa inhlanzi endizayo engakabanjwa ukuze ayinikeze. ukuntula; ephetha ngokusikisela ukuthi umkhumbi wakhe wawuyilokho ngempela eNdaweni Yokudoba okubizwa ngokuthi 
      <i>
        ohlanzekile
      </i>
       (okungukuthi, ongenalutho), olifanele kahle igama likaJungfrau noma iNcasakazi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Izidingo zakhe zanikezwa, uDerick wahamba; kodwa wayengakaluzuzi uhlangothi lomkhumbi wakhe, lapho imikhomo icishe iphakanyiswe ngasikhathi sinye ezinhlokweni zezinsika zombili zemikhumbi; futhi elangazelele ukujaha uDerick, kangangokuthi ngaphandle kokuma kancane wafaka umgqomo wakhe kawoyela kanye nesiphakeli sesibani emkhunjini, wazulazula esikebheni sakhe futhi walandela izibani zikaLeviyathani.

    <p>
       Manje, umdlalo usukhuphukele ku-leeward, yena nezinye izikebhe ezintathu zaseJalimane ezamlandela ngokushesha, babenesiqalo esikhulu sezikebhe zePequod. Kwakukhona imikhomo eyisishiyagalombili, i-pod evamile. Eqaphela ubungozi bawo, wonke ayeqonde ngqo ngasemoyeni ngesivinini esikhulu, ehlikihla izinhlangothi zawo ngendlela ecishe ilingane namahhashi aboshwe ngamahhani. Bashiya umlindelo omkhulu, obanzi, njengokungathi baqhubeka beqaqa isikhumba esikhulu esibanzi phezu kolwandle.
    </p>
    <p>
       Egcwele kulokhu kuvuka okusheshayo, futhi amafathomu amaningi ngemuva, yabhukuda inkunzi enkulu, egobile, okwathi ngokuthuthuka kwayo kancane ngokuqhathaniswa, kanye nokugqunywa okungavamile okuphuzi okweqile, kwabonakala kuphethwe i-jaundice, noma okunye ubuthakathaka. Ukuthi ngabe lo mkhomo wawungowe-pod kusengaphambili, wabonakala ungabazekayo; Ngoba akusona ngokwesiko ama-leviyathan anjalo angenakuhlonishwa ukuba kuwo wonke ezenhlalo. Noma kunjalo, wanamathela ekuphaphameni kwabo, nakuba ngempela amanzi abo angemuva kumelwe ukuba ambambezela, ngoba ithambo elimhlophe noma elivuvuke emlonyeni wakhe obanzi lalidabukile, njengokuvuvukala okwenzeka lapho kuhlangana imisinga emibili enonya. Umlomo wakhe wawumfushane, unensa, futhi ukhandleka; ephuma emanzi amponjwana, futhi azichithela izingcezwana eziklebhukile, kulandelwa isiphithiphithi esiyinqaba ngaphansi komhlaba, esasibonakala siphuma komunye umkhawulo wakhe ongcwatshwe, okwenza amanzi angemva kwakhe agxume.

       “Ubani one-paregoric?” kusho uStubb, “uphethwe yisisu, ngiyesaba. Nkosi, cabanga ngokuba nengxenye yehektare yesisu esibuhlungu! Umoya omubi ubambe ukhisimusi ohlanya kuye bafana. Kungumoya omubi wokuqala engake ngazi ukuvunguza usuka enyakatho; kodwa bheka, ingabe umkhomo wake wazamula kanjalo ngaphambili? Kumele kube, ulahlekelwe yi-tiller yakhe. &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Njengomuntu waseNdiya owayegcwele edonsa ugu lwaseHindostan nomthwalo wesiteki wamahhashi ethukile, ama-careens, ama-buries, ama-roll, nama-wallows endleleni yakhe; kanjalo nalo mkhomo omdala waphakamisa inqwaba yawo osekhulile, futhi manje futhi ngokunye uphendukisa izimbambo zawo ezigobile, adalule imbangela yokuvuka kwawo okukhohlisayo esiphunzini esingesona semvelo sophiko lwakhe lwenkanyezi. Ukuthi wayelahlekelwe yileso siphetho empini, noma wazalwa engenaso, kwakunzima ukusho.

       “Ake ume kancane, chap endala, futhi ngizokunikeza isihlilingi saleyongalo elimele,” kukhala iFlaski enonya, ekhomba umugqa womkhomo eduze kwakhe.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Khumbula ukuthi akakujikijeli ngayo,” kukhala uStarbuck. &quot;Phindani, noma amaJalimane azoba naYe.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngenhloso eyodwa zonke izikebhe ezihlangene eziphikisanayo zazikhomba le nhlanzi eyodwa, ngoba kwakungeyona nje enkulu kunazo zonke, ngakho-ke yayiyi-whale eyigugu kakhulu, kodwa yayiseduze nabo, kanti eminye imikhomo yayihamba ngesivinini esikhulu kangaka, ngaphezu kwalokho, cishe ukudelela ukuphishekela isikhathi. Kulesi sigameko se-PEQOOD&#39;s Ceels sasidutshulwe yizikebhe ezintathu zaseJalimane zagcina zehliswa; Kepha kusukela ekuqaleni okukhulu ayenakho, isikebhe sikaDerick saqhubeka nokujaha ukujaha, noma kunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi lapho kusondela izimbangi zakhe zakwamanye amazwe. Okuwukuphela kwento ababeyesaba, ukuthi, ekubeni vele eseseduze kangaka nophawu lwakhe, wayezovunyelwa ukuba adubule insimbi yakhe ngaphambi kokuba bamthole ngokuphelele futhi bamdlule. UDerick yena, wayebonakala eqiniseka impela ukuthi kuzoba njalo, futhi ngezikhathi ezithile enyakazisa isiphakeli sakhe kwezinye izikebhe ngokubhuqa.
    </p>

       “Inja engenamusa nengabongiyo!” wakhala i-Starbuck; “Uyangiklolodela futhi angiqaqe ngebhokisi elimpofu kakhulu engamgcwalisela lona emizuzwini emihlanu edlule!”—bese ekuhleba kwakudala okunamandla—“Dedela, ma-greyhounds! Inja kuyo!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ngiyanitshela ukuthi kuyini, madoda”—wakhala uStubb ethimbeni lakhe—“kuphambene nenkolo yami ukusangana; kodwa ngingathanda ukudla lowo Yarman oyisikhohlakali—Pull—angithi? Nizomvusa lowo rascal nina? Ngabe uyamthanda uBrandy? I-hogshead ye-brandy, ke, endodeni engcono kakhulu. Wozani, kungani abanye benu bengawuqhumisi umthambo wegazi? Ngubani oye waphonsa i-anchor ngaphezulu Halloo, nangu utshani obukhula phansi phansi - futhi yiNkosi, i-mast lapho i-budding. Lokhu ngeke kwenzeke, bafana. Bheka lowo Yarman! Imfishane nelinde kuyo likhona, madoda, niyosikhafulela umlilo noma cha? &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       “O! bheka amaqhinga awenzayo!” Flask cries, ukudansa phezulu naphansi- &quot;Ukuthi Hump-OH, 
      <i>
        Ingabe I
      </i>
       -Pile Esenkombeni Yenkomo Njengelogi! O! bafana bami,

      <i>
        Ungenzi!
      </i>
       -Bheka i-Yarmanan i-sogger enjalo! Awusithandi isidoda? Kusukela amadola ayizinkulungwane ezintathu, amadoda! -Ibhange! -Ibhange lonke! Ibhange laseNgilandi!—Oh,

        do!
      </i>
       -Ukhuluma ngani lowo Yarman manje?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Okwamanje uDerick ubesesimweni sokuphonsa isibani sakhe esibikezelweni sezikebhe ezithuthukayo, futhi namafutha akhe - angenza; mhlawumbe ngombono okabili wokuhlehlisa indlela yezimbangi zakhe, futhi ngesikhathi esifanayo asheshise eyakhe ngokomnotho ngomfutho wesikhashana wokujikijela emuva.

    <p>
       “Inja yaseDashi engenasimilo!” Kumemeza uStubb. &quot;Donsela manje, abesilisa, njengezinkulungwane eziyizinkulungwane ezingamashumi amahlanu-of-hine-of-hine-of-hit amadimoni anezinwele ezibomvu. Uthini, Tashtego; ingabe uyindoda yokunqamula umgogodla wakho ube yizicucu ezimbili namashumi amabili ukuze uhloniphe u-Gayhead omdala? Uthini?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ngithi, donsa njengedamu likankulunkulu,” kukhala iNdiya.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngolaka, kodwa ngokulinganayo egqugquzelwa ukukloloda kwamaJalimane, izikebhe ezintathu zePequod manje zaqala ukusukela cishe ngokulingana; futhi, ethanda kanjalo, wasondela kuye okwesikhashana. Kulolo hlelo oluhle, oluvulekile, isimo sengqondo sekhanda lapho usondela ekuphangeni kwakhe, ngezikhathi ezithile basukuma ngokuziqhenya, ngezikhathi ezithile basekela umsunguli we-ostram ngokukhala, &quot;lapho, amaslayidi, manje! Shesha umoya omhlophe qwa! Phansi ngeYarman! Hamba ngomkhumbi phezu kwakhe!”
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa wanquma kanjalo isiqalo sokuqala uDerick ayenaso, ukuthi naphezu kwabo bonke ubuqhawe babo, wayezofakazela umnqobi kulo mjaho, ukube ukwahlulela okulungile kwehlela phezu kwakhe inkalankala eyabamba inkaba yesigwedlo sakhe esiphakathi. Ngenkathi le mithi exubile izama ukukhulula umlotha wakhe omhlophe, futhi ngenkathi, ngenxa yalokho, isikebhe sikaDerick sase sicishe sifaka, futhi waduma emadodeni akhe ngokufutheka okukhulu; - leso kwakuyisikhathi esihle se-Starbuck, Stubb, kanye. Flask. Ngokumemeza, bathatha isiqalo esifayo baya phambili, futhi behla benyuka engxenyeni yamaJalimane. Ngokuphazima kweso, futhi zozine izikebhe zase zisemoyeni ngokushesha womkhomo, ngenkathi zisuka kuzo, nhlangothi zombili, kwaba ukukhukhumala okunamagwebu akwenza.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kwakuwukubona okukhulu, okunovalo kakhulu, nokuhlanya. Umkhomo wawusuphuma ikhanda, futhi uthumela umpompo wakhe phambi kwakhe ngendiza ehlushwa njalo; kuyilapho iphiko lakhe elilodwa elimpofu lishaya uhlangothi lwakhe ngobuhlungu bokwethuka. Manje kuleli sandla manje, wabopha endizeni yakhe edonsela phansi, futhi kuwo wonke ama-filyw aphule wona, wangena emgodini olwandle, noma eceleni kwezulu ebheke esibhakabhakeni Kanjalo ngike ngabona inyoni enamaphiko anqanyuliwe yenza iziyingi eziphukile emoyeni, ize izame ukubalekela oklebe. Kodwa inyoni inezwi, futhi ngokukhala okudabukisayo iyokwazisa ukwesaba kwayo; Kepha ukwesaba kwaleli zulu eliyisimungulu eliyisimungulu, kwaboshwa kwathi kwafakwa kuye; Wayengenazwi, elondolozela lokho kudonswa ukuphefumula ngomoya wakhe, futhi lokhu kwambona kungadabuki; ngenkathi namanje, ngobuningi bayo obumangalisayo, umhlathi we-portcullis, nomsila onamandla onke, kwakwanele ukushaqisa indoda eqine kakhulu eyayidabuke kakhulu.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngokubona manje lokho kodwa imizuzwana embalwa kakhulu bekuzonikeza izikebhe zePequod ithuba elihle, futhi kunokuba ahlukunyezwe kanjalo emdlalweni wakhe, uDerick wakhetha ukubeka engozini lokho okwakumelwe kubonakale kuwumcibisholo omude kakhulu kuyena, ngaphambi kokuba ithuba lokugcina libe phakade. phunyuka.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa kwathi lapho i-harpooneer yakhe isukuma ifuna ukushaya, lawo mahlosi amathathu—uQueequeg, uTashtego, uDaggoo—avele asukuma ema ngezinyawo zawo, futhi ema umugqa odayagonali, kanyekanye akhombe ama-barbs awo; futhi yagijima phezu kwekhanda le-harpooneer yaseJalimane, izinsimbi zabo ezintathu ze-Nantucket zangena emkhomo. Umusi ophuphuthekisayo wegwebu nomlilo omhlophe! Lezi zikebhe ezintathu, ekufuneni kokuqala kwe-healeng rush ehamba ngezinyawo, zamisa umdlandla wamaJalimane ngamandla anjalo, ukuthi bobabili uHerick neHarpooneer yakhe exakile bapakelwa ngaphandle, baphume ngomkhumbi ngama-kels amathathu andizayo.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ungesabi, amabhokisi ami ebhotela,” kumemeza uStubb, ewabuka edlula lapho edubula; “nizolandwa njengamanje—kulungile—ngibone oshaka empumalanga—eSt. Izinja zikaBernard, uyazi-phuca abahambi abacindezelekile. Hurray! nansi indlela yokuhamba ngomkhumbi manje. Wonke ama-sunbeam! Hurray! -Waya njengama-tin kettles amathathu emsileni we-Cougar! Lokhu kungifaka engqondweni yokubophela indlovu e-tilbury ethafeni—kwenza izipoki zamasondo zindize, bafana, uma ninamathela kuyo ngaleyo ndlela; futhi kukhona ingozi yokuxoshwa futhi, lapho ushaya igquma. Hurray! lena yindlela omunye umfo azizwa ngayo lapho eya ku-Davy Jones—konke kuwukugijima kwendiza engapheli! Hurrah! lo mkhomo uphethe iposi laphakade!”
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa ukugijima kwenunu kwaba okufushane. Esho ehefuzela ngokuphazima kweso, azwakale enomsindo. Nge-Spating Rush, le migqa emithathu indiza izungeze ama-loggerheads ngamandla anjengawona anamandla okuthi i-gouge ama-grooves ajulile kuwo; kuyilapho ama-harpooneers ayesaba kangangokuthi lokhu kukhalisa okusheshayo kwakuzoqeda imigqa, kangangokuthi ngokusebenzisa wonke amandla abo obuqili, abamba amajika kagwayi aphindaphindiwe ngentambo ukuze abambelele; Kuze kube ekugcineni ngenxa yoxako lokuhlaselwa okuvela kumakhambi aholele ezikebheni, lapho izintambo ezintathu ziqonde ngqo ezingubeni eziluhlaza okwesibhakabhaka - izibhamu zeminsalo zazicishe zibe namanzi, kanti ama-sterns amathathu agcwele phezulu umoya. Futhi ngokushesha umkhomo uyeka ukuzwakala, isikhathi esithile bahlala kuleso simo sengqondo, besaba ukuchitha umugqa owengeziwe, nakuba isimo sasibukeka kancane. Kodwa nakuba izikebhe ziye zehliswa futhi zalahleka ngalendlela, nokho yilokhu “kubambelela,” njengoba kubizwa kanjalo; Lokhu ukubopha ngebaba ebukhali yenyama yakhe bukhoma kusuka emuva; yilokhu okuvame ukuhlupha uLeviyathani aze avuke ngokushesha ukuze ahlangane nomkhonto obukhali wezitha zakhe. Nokho singakhulumi ngengozi yento, kufanele kungatshazwa ukuthi le nkambo ihlale ihamba phambili; ngoba kunengqondo ukuphetha ngokuthi, lapho umkhomo oshayiwe ehlala isikhathi eside ngaphansi kwamanzi, uphelelwa ngamandla. Ngoba, ngenxa yendawo enkulu yakhe - esidodalweni esigcwele esikhule yinto engaphansi kwamamitha-skwele angama-2000 - ingcindezi yamanzi ayikhulu. Sonke siyazi ukuthi thina ngokwethu simi ngaphansi kwesisindo esingakanani somkhathi; ngisho nalapha, ngaphezu komhlaba, emoyeni; Khona-ke, yeka ukuthi mkhulu kangakanani umthwalo womkhomo, othwele emhlane wakhe insika yamafathomu angamakhulu amabili olwandle! Kumele okungenani alingane nesisindo samashumi amahlanu aventu. Umhlangeli othile uwulinganise ngesisindo semikhumbi yemikhumbi emibi engamashumi amabili, nazo zonke izibhamu, nezitolo, kanye nabesilisa abasebhodini.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lapho izikebhe ezintathu zilala lapho kulolo lwasolwandle olugoqayo, zibheke phansi zibe yimini yaphakade eluhlaza okwesibhakabhaka; Futhi njengokububula okukodwa noma ukukhala kwanoma yiluphi uhlobo, cha, hhayi kangako njenge-ripple noma i-bubble yakhuphuka kusukela ekujuleni kwayo; imuphi umuntu womhlaba owayengacabanga ukuthi ngaphansi kwakho konke lokho kuthula nokuzola, isilo esikhulu kunazo zonke sasolwandle sasigubha futhi sidabukisa ngobuhlungu! Kwakungabonakali amasentimitha ayisishiyagalombili endophi ye-perpendicular eminsalweni. Kubonakala sengathi kuyathembeka ukuthi ngemicu emithathu emincane enjalo yale ncwadi yeLeviyathan yamiswa njengesisindo esikhulu sewashi lezinsuku eziyisishiyagalombili. Imisiwe? futhi yini? Kuma-bits amathathu ebhodi. Ingabe lesi yilesi isidalwa sayo sasithi saya ngokunqoba kangaka - &quot;Uyakwazi ukugcwalisa isikhumba sakhe ngezinsimbi ezivinjelwe? noma ikhanda lakhe linemikhonto yezinhlanzi na? Inkemba yalowo oyamelelayo ayinakubamba, umkhonto, umkhiwane, noHabeseloni; ubona insimbi njengotshani; umcibisholo awukwazi ukuyibalekela; imicibisholo ibalwa njengezinhlanga; uyahleka ukuvevezela komkhonto. Lesi sidalwa? na? O! Ukuthi lokho kungcola kufanele kulandele abaprofethi. Ngokuba ngamandla amathanga ayinkulungwane emsileni wakhe, uLeviyathani wagijimisa ikhanda lakhe phansi kwezintaba zolwandle, ukumfihla emikhontoni yezinhlanzi zasePequod!

       Kulokho kukhanya kwelanga lantambama elehlelayo, izithunzi ezazehliselwa izikebhe ezintathu ngaphansi kwamanzi, kumelwe ukuba zazizinde ngokwanele futhi zibanzi ngokwanele ukuba zifihle ingxenye yebutho lika-Xerxes. Ubani ongasho ukuthi umkhomo olimele kumelwe ukuba wawushaqisa kanjani izigigaba ezinkulu kangaka ezazindiza phezu kwekhanda lakhe!

       “Yimani eduze, madoda; Uyavusa, &quot;kumemeza indlala emithathu ngokuzumayo emanzini, egqamile kakhulu emanzini, ngokuhlukahluka kuye phezulu, ngokufana nezintambo zikazibuthe, impilo nokufa kuyamangaza umkhomo, ukuze wonke umuntu we-oarsman wabazwa esihlalweni sakhe. Ngomzuzu olandelayo, ngokukhululeka okukhulu ekucindezelekeni okuya phansi emicibisholo, izikebhe zagxuma ngokuzumayo zibheke phezulu, njengenkundla encane yeqhwa, lapho umhlambi ominyene wamabhere amhlophe wesaba usuka kuwo uye olwandle.

       Izisusa zakhe zibonisa ukukhathala kwakhe ngokweqile. Ezilwaneni eziningi ezihlala emhlabeni kunamavalvu athile noma amasango ezikhukhula emithanjeni yazo eminingi, lapho lapho zilimele, igazi livaleka ngezinga elithile okungenani ngokuphazima kweso liya ezindaweni ezithile. Akunjalo nge-whale; okunye okukhethekile okuwukuba nesakhiwo sonke esingeyona i-valvular semithambo yegazi, ukuze kuthi lapho ebhobozwa ngisho nephuzu elincane njenge-harpoon, kuqale ngokushesha umsele obulalayo phezu kwawo wonke uhlelo lwakhe lwemithambo; futhi lapho lokhu kukhushulwa ukucindezela okungavamile kwamanzi ebangeni elikhulu ngaphansi kwamanzi, ukuphila kwakhe kungase kuthiwe kuthulula kuye ngemifudlana engapheli. Nokho likhulu kakhulu igazi elikuye, futhi likude futhi miningi imithombo yalo engaphakathi, kangangokuthi uyoqhubeka ephuma kanjalo nokopha isikhathi eside; Ngisho nakusogwini umfula uyogeleza, umthombo wakhe useziphepheni ezihamba kahle namagquma angabonakali. Ngisho namanje, lapho izikebhe zidonsa lo mkhomo, futhi ngokuyingozi zidonsela phezu kwezimpukane zakhe ezinyakazayo, futhi izijula ​​zijikijelwa kuye, zalandelwa amajethi aqinile avela enxebeni elisha elenziwe, elalilokhu lidlala njalo, kuyilapho imbobo yemvelo. Ekhanda lakhe kwakukhona ngezikhathi ezithile, noma ngabe kushesha, kuthunyelwa umswakama wawo ominyene emoyeni. Kuleli veni lokugcina alinagazi nokho, ngoba ayikho ingxenye ebalulekile yakhe eyayikade yahlaselwa kangaka. Impilo yakhe, njengoba ibhayibiza kakhulu, ayikaze ibe khona.

       Lapho izikebhe manje zimzungeza eduze, yonke ingxenye engenhla yefomu lakhe, inabantu abaningi. Amehlo akhe, noma kunalokho izindawo lapho amehlo akhe ayekade ekhona, abonwa. Njengoba izixuku ezingavamile ezingavamile zibuthana emigodini yamafindo ezihlahla ze-oki ezinhle kakhulu lapho ziguqe, ngakho kusukela emaphuzwini amehlo omkhomo ake ahlala kuwo, manje ama-bulb ayimpumputhe, okudabukisayo ngendlela edabukisayo. Kepha isihawu kwakungekho muntu. Kuwo wonke amadala akhe, nengalo yakhe eyodwa, namehlo akhe angaboni, kufanele afe ngokufa abulale, ukuze akhanyise amasonto ezitabane nokunye ukujabulele amasonto ashunyayo inoffensivic bonke kubo bonke. Esaginqika egazini, ekugcineni wadalula ingxenye ethile eguquguquke ngendlela exakile, elingana nebhashi, ephansi ehlangothini.

Ngokuphazima kweso indiza enesilonda yadubula kuleli nxeba elinonya, futhi yabangelwa usizi olungaphezu kobuhlungu, umkhomo manje ukhipha igazi eliwugqinsi, ngokufutheka okusheshayo wagijimela umkhumbi ngokuphuphutheka, wabahlakaza kanye namabutho abo aqhoshayo yonke indawo. izihlambi ezigelezayo, eziketula isikebhe seFlask futhi sonakalise iminsalo. Kwakuwukuthikamezeka kwakhe ukufa. Ngoba, ngalesi sikhathi, wawuchitha kangaka ngokulahlekelwa yigazi, ukuthi asuswe ekulimaleni ayenzile; walala ehefuzela ngohlangothi, ebhakuzisa iphiko lakhe elicijile, abese ezungeza kancane kancane kuhle kwezwe elinciphayo; waveza izimfihlo ezimhlophe zesisu sakhe; walala njengogodo, wafa. Kwakubuhlungu kakhulu, lokho kuphuma kokugcina okuphelelwa yisikhathi. Njengalapho ngezandla ezingabonakali amanzi kancane kancane adonswa emthonjeni othile onamandla, futhi ngokuncibilika okuncibilika kwe-melancholy ikholomu ye-spray yehla futhi yehlele phansi—ukuze kube nomsele wokugcina omude ofayo womkhomo.

Namuhla konke ePequod kwakungu-Aslant. Ukuwela ngaphesheya kompheme kwakunjengokuhamba ophahleni lwendlu ekhuphukile. Umkhumbi wabubula waphana. Iningi lezinto ezihlotshiswe ngamazinyo endlovu ezingosi zakhe kanye namakhabethe aqalwa ezindaweni zawo, ngokugudluzwa okungekhona okwemvelo. Ngezandla ezinamaketanga nangeziphetho zathathwa emaketangeni angenakusukwa - amaketanga okususwa, ukuze aze azenze awele emakhefini; Futhi umkhomo ophansi kangaka wawusekuthi umkhomo wawusekuthi amaphethelo angenasisekelo awakwazanga ukusondela kuwo, kanti wonke amathani aphelele okuphakelayo abonakala engezwe kubuningi obukhulu, futhi umkhumbi wawubonakala usephupheni.

Lo mehluko ohlotsheni lwezilwane ngokungangabazeki awunakulinganiswa nakancane ngokwesilinganiso esikhulu samathambo ku-Right Whale; izimpumputhe zakhe zaseVenice zodwa ngezinye izikhathi ezinesisindo esingaphezu kwethani; Ukusuka kulokhu kuncenga i-sperm whale mahhala ngokuphelele. Kodwa kunezimo lapho, ngemva kokuphela kwamahora amaningi noma izinsuku ezimbalwa, umkhomo oshisiwe uphinde uvuke, uqhuma kakhulu kunokuphila. Kepha isizathu salokhu sobala.

Noma kunjalo, i-spout ye-Fin-Back ifana kakhulu ne-Sperm Whale, kangangokuthi abadobi abangenamakhono ngokuvamile ibhekwa njengephutha. Futhi ngenxa yalokho uDerick kanye nabo bonke ababemphethe manje base bejaha ngesibindi lesi sihluku esingalawuleki. Intombi edonsela yonke isikebhe, yenziwa emva kwezinkinobho zayo ezine ezincane, futhi ngakho-ke bonke banyamalala kude kakhulu, bajaha ngokugqamile, baxosha ngethemba.

       CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
       One old Sag-Harbor whaleman&#39;s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah&#39;s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small. But, to this, Bishop Jebb&#39;s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale&#39;s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale&#39;s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.
    </p>
    <p>
       Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale&#39;s gastric juices. But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a 
      <i>
        dead
      </i>
       whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some craft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an inflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days&#39; journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days&#39; journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?
    </p>
    <p>
       But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah&#39;s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
       But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah&#39;s going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris&#39;s Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.

    </h2>
    <p>
       To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft&#39;s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.
    </p>
    <p>
       Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight, as of Cleopatra&#39;s barges from Actium.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb&#39;s was foremost. By great exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious. What then remained?
    </p>
    <p>
       Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced, none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting.
    </p>
    <p>
       But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.
    </p>
    <p>
       Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before his waistband&#39;s middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
    </p>
    <p>
       “That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “&#39;Tis July&#39;s immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad, I&#39;d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we&#39;d drink round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we&#39;d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches the monster die.

       CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.
    </h2>
    <p>
       That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o&#39;clock PM of this sixteenth day of December, AD 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a noteworthy thing.
    </p>
    <p>
       Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human being&#39;s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale&#39;s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
       If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in 
      <i>
        having his spoutings out
      </i>
       , as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the whale&#39;s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!
    </p>
    <p>
       In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
       It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
       Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale&#39;s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.
    </p>
    <p>
       But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
       The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale&#39;s head? For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary&#39;s in the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout alone.
    </p>
    <p>
       Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.
    </p>
    <p>
       And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For, d&#39;ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.
