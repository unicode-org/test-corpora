       ISAHLUKO 1. Ukuthungatha.

    <p>
       Ngibize ngo-Ishmayeli. Eminyakeni ethile edlule—ngingakhathali ukuthi kwakuyoze kube nini ngokunembayo—nginayo imali encane noma ngingenayo nhlobo esikhwameni sami, futhi ngingenalutho olukhethekile olungithakaselayo ogwini, ngacabanga ukuthi ngizohamba ngomkhumbi kancane ngibone ingxenye yomhlaba enamanzi. Kuyindlela enginayo yokukhipha ubende futhi ngilawule ukujikeleza kwegazi. Noma nini lapho ngizithola ngikhula nginomunyu emlonyeni; noma nini lapho kunomswakama, ngoNovemba obandayo emphefumulweni wami; noma nini lapho ngizithola ngima phambi kwezindawo zokugcina amabhokisi ngingathandi, futhi ngiveza ingemuva layo yonke imingcwabo engihlangana nayo; futhi ikakhulukazi noma nini lapho ama-hypos ami engithola phezulu kangaka, kangangokuthi kudinga isimiso esiqinile sokuziphatha ukungivimbela ekungeneni ngamabomu emgwaqweni, futhi ngikhiphe izigqoko zabantu ngendlela ehlelekile—khona-ke, ngikubheka njengesikhathi esifanele sokufika olwandle ngokushesha. njengoba ngingakwazi. Lena indawo yami yesibhamu nebhola. Ngokuchuma kwefilosofi uCato uziphonsa phezu kwenkemba yakhe; Ngihamba buthule ngiye emkhunjini. Akukho okumangazayo kulokhu. Ukube bebekwazi, cishe bonke abantu ngezinga labo, ngesinye isikhathi noma okunye, bayayithokozela imizwa efanayo enginayo ngolwandle.

       Manje sekunedolobha lakho elingaseceleni laseManhattoes, elizungezwe izikebhe njengeziqhingi zaseNdiya ngenxa yezixhobo zamakhorali—zentengiselwano zilizungeza ngokuntweza kwayo. Kwesokudla nakwesokunxele, imigwaqo ikuyisa emanzini. Indawo emaphakathi nedolobha ibhethri, lapho leyo mvukuzane igezwa ngamagagasi, futhi ipholiswe umoya, okwathi emahoreni ambalwa edlule ibingabonakali emhlabeni. Bheka izixuku zabantu ababuka amanzi lapho.
    </p>
    <p>
       Zungeza idolobha ngeSabatha ntambama ephuphile. Hamba usuka e-Corlears Hook uye e-Coenties Slip, bese usuka lapho, ngase-Whitehall, ubheke enyakatho. Ubonani?—Kufakwe njengabalindi abathule kulo lonke idolobha, kumi izinkulungwane ngezinkulungwane zabantu abafayo belalele imincintiswano yasolwandle. Abanye bencike kuma-spiles; abanye behlezi phezu kwamakhanda abo; abanye bebheka phezu kwezindonga zemikhumbi evela eShayina; ezinye ziphakeme kakhulu ku-rigging, njengokungathi uzama ukuthola umbono ongcono wolwandle. Kodwa bonke laba bangabantu bezwe; izinsuku zesonto eziboshelwe ku-lath nokhonkolo—ziboshelwe ezintweni zokubala, zibethelwe emabhentshini, zichonywe emadeskini. Kunjani-ke lokhu? Ingabe amasimu aluhlaza aphelile? Benzani lapha?
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa bheka! nakhu kufika ezinye izixuku, zigqolozela ziqonde emanzini, futhi kubonakala sengathi zizocwila emanzini. Kuyamangaza! Akukho okuyobanelisa ngaphandle komkhawulo wezwe; ukuzulazula ngaphansi komthunzi omnyama wezindawo zokugcina izimpahla ngeke kwanele. Cha. Kumelwe basondele emanzini ngangokunokwenzeka ngaphandle kokuwela. Futhi bamile—amamayela abo—amaligi. Bonke abantu basemaphandleni bavela emigwaqweni nasezindleleni, emigwaqweni nasezindleleni—enyakatho, empumalanga, eningizimu nasentshonalanga. Nokho lapha bonke bayahlangana. Ake ungitshele, ingabe amandla kazibuthe ezinaliti zekhampasi zayo yonke leyo mikhumbi zibaheha lapho?
    </p>
    <p>
       Kanye futhi. Ithi usezweni; endaweni ethile ephakeme yamachibi. Thatha cishe noma iyiphi indlela oyithandayo, futhi ishumi liye kwenye likuyisa esigodini, likushiye lapho ngasechibini emfudlaneni. Kunomlingo kuwo. Umuntu ongenangqondo makangene ekujuleni kwenhliziyo yakhe—ima lowo muntu emilenzeni yakhe, amise izinyawo zakhe, futhi ngokuqinisekile uyokuholela emanzini, uma ekhona amanzi kuso sonke leso sifunda. Uma uke wome ogwadule olukhulu lwaseMelika, zama lokhu kuhlola, uma umahamba-nendlwana wakho kungenzeka unikezwe uprofesa we-metaphysical. Yebo, njengoba wonke umuntu azi, ukuzindla namanzi kushada kuze kube phakade.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa nangu umculi. Ufisa ukukupenda indawo ephuphe kakhulu, enomthunzi, ethule, ekhanga kakhulu yezothando kuso sonke isigodi se-Saco. Isiphi isici esiyinhloko asisebenzisayo? Kumi izihlahla zakhe, yileso naleso sinesiqu esingenalutho, njengokungathi kukhona umhlwa nesiphambano; lapha kulele idlelo lakhe, nezinkomo zakhe zilele khona; futhi ukusuka laphaya endlini encane kuphuma intuthu eyozela. Ekujuleni kwehlathi elikude kunendlela ewumsangano, efinyelela emigqumeni enqwabelene yezintaba ezigcwele uhlaza okwesibhakabhaka emagqumeni. Kodwa nakuba lesi sithombe sicatshangelwe kanjalo, futhi nakuba lesisihlahla sikaphayini sinyakazisa ukububula kwaso njengamahlamvu ekhanda lomalusi, nokho konke kwakuyize, ngaphandle uma iso likamalusi laligxile emfudlaneni womlingo phambi kwakhe. Hamba uvakashele ePrairies ngo-June, lapho ibanga elingamakhilomitha amaningi ugibela emadolweni phakathi kweminduze yeTiger—iyiphi intelezi eyodwa eyifunayo?—Amanzi—alikho neconsi lamanzi lapho! Ingabe i-Niagara yayiwulwelwesi lwesihlabathi, ungahamba amakhilomitha ayinkulungwane ukuze uyibone? Kungani imbongi empofu yaseTennessee, lapho ngokuzumayo ithola izinhlamvu ezimbili zesiliva, yenza ngamabomu ukuthi imthengele ijazi, eyayilidinga ngokudabukisayo, noma itshale imali yayo ohambweni lwabahamba ngezinyawo oluya e-Rockaway Beach? Kungani cishe wonke umfana onempilo eqinile onomphefumulo onamandla onempilo phakathi kwakhe, ngesinye isikhathi noma okunye ukuhlanya ukuya olwandle? Kungani ohambweni lwakho lokuqala njengomgibeli, wena ngokwakho wezwa ukundindizela okungaka, lapho utshelwa okokuqala ukuthi wena nomkhumbi wakho anisaboni ezweni? Kungani amaPheresiya amadala agcina ulwandle lungcwele? Kungani amaGreki amnika unkulunkulu ohlukile, nomfowabo kaJove? Impela konke lokhu akusho lutho. Futhi isajula nakakhulu incazelo yaleyo ndaba kaNarcissus, okwathi ngenxa yokuthi wayengakwazi ukubamba isithombe esibuhlungu, esimnene asibona emthonjeni, waphonseka kuwo futhi waminza. Kodwa wona lowo mfanekiso, thina ngokwethu siwubona kuyo yonke imifula nezilwandle. Kungumfanekiso wephantom yokuphila engenakuqondwa; futhi lokhu kuyisihluthulelo sakho konke.

       Manje, uma ngithi nginomkhuba wokuhamba olwandle noma nini lapho ngiqala ukufiphala emehlweni, futhi ngiqala ukuqaphela kakhulu amaphaphu ami, angiqondile ukuthi kuthiwe ngike ngiye olwandle umgibeli. Ukuze uhambe njengomgibeli kumele ube nesikhwama semali, kanti nesikhwama simane nje siyinikiniki ngaphandle kokuthi kukhona okuthile kuso. Ngaphandle kwalokho, abagibeli baguliswa ulwandle—baxabene—abalali ebusuku—abajabuleli kakhulu, njengento evamile;—cha, angisoze ngahamba njengomgibeli; futhi, nakuba ngiyinto kasawoti, angikaze ngiye olwandle njengeCommodore, noma uKaputeni, noma uMpheki. Ngishiya inkazimulo nokwehluka kwezikhundla ezinjalo kulabo abazithandayo. Ngokwami ​​uhlangothi, ngiyakwenyanya konke ukukhandleka okuhloniphekile okuhloniphekile, ukulingwa, nezinsizi zazo zonke izinhlobo. Kuningi kakhulu engingakwenza ukuze ngizinakekele, ngaphandle kokunakekela imikhumbi, ama-barques, amabrig, ama-schooners, nokunye okungenjalo. Futhi mayelana nokuhamba njengompheki, - noma ngivuma ukuthi kunenkazimulo enkulu kulokho, umpheki eyisikhulu ebhodini lomkhumbi - nokho, ngandlela thize, angizange ngithande izinyoni ezi-broiling; - nakuba kwake kwasongwa, kwagcotshwa ngobuhlakani, futhi ngokwahlulela. okufakwe usawoti kanye nopelepele, akekho ozokhuluma ngenhlonipho, ngingasho ngenhlonipho, ngenyoni eyosiwe njengami. Kungenxa yamachashaza okukhulekela izithombe amaGibhithe amadala phezu kwezinkumbi ezigazingiwe nehhashi lomfula eligazingiwe, lapho ubona khona izidumbu zalezo zilwane ezindlini zazo ezinkulu zokubhaka imibhoshongo.

       Cha, uma ngiya olwandle, ngihamba njengetilosi elilula, khona kanye ngaphambi kwensika, ngiqonde phansi esigodlweni, phezulu lapho ngiya enhloko yensika yasebukhosini. Yiqiniso, bangiyala ngokunye, futhi bangenze ngigxume ngisuka ko-spar ngiye kwenye, njengentethe endaweni eyimfunda kaMeyi. Futhi ekuqaleni, lolu hlobo lwento alujabulisi ngokwanele. Kuthinta umuzwa womuntu wokuhlonipha, ikakhulukazi uma uvela emndenini omdala osungulwe ezweni, ama-Van Rensselaers, noma ama-Randolphs, noma ama-Hardicanutes. Futhi ngaphezu kwakho konke, uma ngaphambi nje kokufaka isandla sakho ebhodweni letiyela, ubulokhu ukhonya njengomfundisi wesikole sasemaphandleni, okwenza abafana abade kunabo bonke bamangele ngawe. Uguquko lubucayi, ngiyakuqinisekisa, ukusuka kumphathi wesikole ukuya etilosini, futhi ludinga isiphuzo esinamandla seSeneca namaStoyiku ukuze ukwazi ukusineka futhi usithwale. Kodwa nalokhu kuyaphela ngokuhamba kwesikhathi.

    <p>
       Kuthiwani, uma ezinye izikhulu zikakapteni wasolwandle engiyalela ukuba ngithathe umshanelo futhi ngishanele phansi? Ngabe lokho kuthukuthela kufana nani, kukalwa, ngisho, esikalini seTestamente Elisha? Ngabe ucabanga ukuthi ingelosi enkulu uGabriel icabanga okuthile okuncane ngami, ngoba ngokushesha nangenhlonipho ngilalela labo bantu abadala kuleso senzakalo? Ubani ongesona isigqila? Ngitshele lokho. Nokho-ke, noma ngabe okaputeni basolwandle abadala bangangiyalela kanjani—noma bangangishaya futhi bangishaye ngesibhakela, ngiba nokwaneliseka ngokwazi ukuthi kulungile; ukuthi wonke umuntu usetshenziswa ngendlela eyodwa noma enye ngendlela efanayo—kungaba ngokombono wenyama noma we-metaphysical, okungukuthi; ngakho-ke ukushaywa kwendawo yonke kuyadluliswa, futhi zonke izandla kufanele zikhuhlane amahlombe, futhi zaneliseke.

       Nalapha futhi, ngihlala ngihamba olwandle njengetilosi, ngoba benza iphuzu lokungikhokhela izinkinga zami, kuyilapho bengakhokhi abagibeli ngisho nesenti elilodwa engake ngezwa ngalo. Kunalokho, abagibeli kufanele bakhokhe. Futhi kukhona umehluko emhlabeni phakathi kokukhokha nokukhokhelwa. Isenzo sokukhokha mhlawumbe siyisenzo esingesihle neze amasela amabili esivande sezithelo asifake kuwo. Kodwa 
      <i>

       ,—kuzoqhathaniswa ngani nakho? Umsebenzi wasemadolobheni umuntu athola ngawo imali uyamangalisa ngempela, uma sicabangela ukuthi sikholelwa ngobuqotho ukuthi imali iyimpande yazo zonke izifo zasemhlabeni, nokuthi akukho lutho umuntu onemali angangena ezulwini. Ah! yeka ukuthi ngokwenama sizinikela ekubhujisweni!

       Ekugcineni, ngihlala ngiya olwandle njengetilosi, ngenxa yokuzivocavoca okunempilo nomoya ohlanzekile wesiteki sangaphambili. Ngoba njengakulo mhlaba, imimoya yamakhanda ivame kakhulu kunemimoya evela empumalanga (okungukuthi, uma ungakaze wephule isimemezelo sePythagorean), ngakho-ke ingxenye enkulu iCommodore esesitezini sekota ithola umoya wayo ngesandla sesibili kumatilosi. esibikezelweni. Ucabanga ukuthi uyawuphefumula kuqala; kodwa akunjalo. Ngendlela efanayo abantu abavamile bahola abaholi babo kwezinye izinto eziningi, ngesikhathi esifanayo abaholi abangakusoli kangako. Kodwa ngalokho-ke kwaba ukuthi ngemva kokuba sengilununcise kaningi ulwandle njengetilosi elingumthengisi, manje kufanele ngikuthathe ekhanda lami ukuba ngihambe ohambweni lomkhomo; leli iphoyisa elingabonakali le-Fates, elihlale lingigadile, futhi lingifaka izinja ngasese, futhi lingithonya ngandlela thize engingenakuziphendulela - lingaphendula kangcono kunanoma yimuphi omunye. Futhi, ngokungangabazeki, ukuhamba kwami ​​kulolu hambo lokudoba imikhomo, kwaba yingxenye yohlelo olukhulu lwe-Providence olwaqalwa kudala. Ingene njengohlobo lwe-interlode emfushane kanye ne-solo phakathi kwamakhonsathi abanzi. Ngithatha ukuthi le ngxenye yomthethosivivinywa kumele ngabe isebenze kanje:

    </p>
    <p>
       Nakuba ngingakwazi ukusho ukuthi kungani ngempela labo baphathi besiteji, abakwaFates, bangibeka phansi ngenxa yale ngxenye engcolile yohambo lomkhomo, lapho abanye babekelwe izingxenye ezinhle ezinhlekeleleni ezinkulu, nezingxenye ezimfushane nezilula kumahlaya ahlakaniphile, futhi izingxenye ezihlekisayo ngamafasi—nakuba ngingakwazi ukusho ukuthi kungani lokhu kwakunjalo ngempela; nokho, manje njengoba ngikhumbula zonke izimo, ngicabanga ukuthi ngiyakwazi ukubona kancane emithonjeni nezisusa ezethulwa kimi ngobuqili ngaphansi kokucasha okuhlukahlukene, zanginxenxa ukuba ngiqale ukwenza ingxenye engiyenzile, ngaphandle kokungifaka enkohlakalweni yokuthi kwaba ukukhetha okwabangelwa inkululeko yami engachemile kanye nokwahlulela okucwasayo.
    </p>

       Okuyinhloko phakathi kwalezi zisusa kwakuwumbono omangalisayo womkhomo omkhulu ngokwawo. Isilo esimangalisa kangaka nesingaqondakali savusa lonke ilukuluku lami. Khona-ke ulwandle lwasendle nezikude lapho egingqa khona isiqhingi sakhe esiningi; izingozi ezingenakubalwa, ezingenamagama zomkhomo; lezi, nazo zonke izimangaliso ezihambela izinkulungwane zezindawo zasePatagonian nemisindo, zangisiza ukuba ngifinyelele esifisweni sami. Ngamanye amadoda, mhlawumbe, izinto ezinjalo bezingeke zibe yizisusa; kodwa mina, ngihlushwa ukulunywa kwaphakade ngenxa yezinto ezikude. Ngiyathanda ukuhamba ngomkhumbi olwandle olungavunyelwe, futhi ngihlale ogwini olungenabugovu. Ngaphandle kokukuziba okuhle, ngiyashesha ukubona izinto ezesabekayo, futhi ngisengahlala ngizihlanganisa nazo—bangangivumela—njengoba kuhle ukuba nobudlelwano obuhle nazo zonke iziboshwa zalapho umuntu alala khona.

       Ngakho-ke, ngenxa yalezi zinto, uhambo lomkhomo lwamukelekile; amasango amakhulu kazamcolo wezwe lezimanga avuleka, futhi ekuzikhukhumezeni kwasendle okwanginyakazisa enjongweni yami, amabili nambili antanta emphefumulweni wami wangaphakathi, udwendwe olungapheli lomkhomo, futhi, phakathi kwawo wonke, elilodwa. i-phantom ene-hooded enkulu, njengegquma leqhwa emoyeni.

       Ngahlohla iyembe elilodwa noma amabili esikhwameni sami esidala sikakhaphethi, ngalifaka ngaphansi kwekhwapha, ngase ngiqala ukuya eCape Horn nasePacific. Lapho ngishiya idolobha elihle laseManhatto endala, ngafika ngokufanelekile eNew Bedford. KwakungoMgqibelo ebusuku ngoDisemba. Ngadumala kakhulu lapho ngizwa ukuthi iphakethe elincane leNantucket lase lihambile, nokuthi ayikho indlela yokufinyelela kuleyo ndawo, kuze kube uMsombuluko olandelayo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Njengoba iningi labantu abasha abazongenela izinhlungu nezijeziso zokudoba imikhomo bema kuyo le-New Bedford, lapho ukuze baqale uhambo lwabo, kungase kuhlotshaniswe nokuthi mina, ngokwami, ngangingenawo umqondo wokwenza kanjalo. Ngoba ingqondo yami yayinqunyelwe ukuhamba ngomkhumbi ngaphandle komkhumbi we-Nantucket, ngoba kwakukhona okuthile okuhle, okunomsindo ngakho konke okuhlobene naleso siqhingi esidala esidumile, okwangijabulisa ngokumangalisayo. Ngaphandle kwalokho nakuba iNew Bedford kade yagcina ukubusa kancane kancane ibhizinisi lokudobela imikhomo, futhi nakuba kule ndaba iNantucket endala empofu manje isisemva kwayo kakhulu, nokho iNantucket yayiyisiqalo sayo esikhulu—iTire lale Carthage;—indawo lapho umMelika wokuqala owashona khona. umkhomo wawuvaleleke. Kuphi ngaphandle kwaseNantucket lapho lawo madoda angama-Aboriginal whalemen, amaRed-Men, aqala agibela izikebhe ukuze ajahe iLeviyathani? Futhi lapho ngaphandle kwase-Nantucket, futhi, lapho leso sloop esincane sokuqala esiyingozi savela khona, ingxenye ethile sigcwele amatshe aphuma kwamanye amazwe—ihamba kanjalo indaba—ukujikijela imikhomo, ukuze kutholwe lapho isiseduze ngokwanele ukuba ibeke engcupheni ihabhu ku-bowsprit. ?

Kwakuwubusuku obubukeka bungabazisa kakhulu, cha, ubusuku obumnyama kakhulu futhi obudabukisayo, amakhaza ahlabayo futhi angenanjabulo. Ngangingazi muntu endaweni. Ngezinhlamvu ezikhathazekile ngangishaye ephaketheni lami, futhi ngakhipha izinhlamvu zesiliva ezimbalwa kuphela, -Ngakho-ke, nomaphi lapho uya khona, u-Ishmayeli, ngasho kimina, njengoba ngimi phakathi nomgwaqo omubi ngiphethe isikhwama sami, futhi ngiqhathanisa ubumnyama bubheke enyakatho nobumnyama bubheke eningizimu—noma yikuphi lapho ngokuhlakanipha kwakho ungase uphethe ngokulala ebusuku, Ishmayeli wami othandekayo, qiniseka ukuthi uyabuza inani, futhi ungakhethi kakhulu.

Kubiza kakhulu futhi kuyahlekisa, ngaphinda ngacabanga, ngima kancane ngibuka ukukhanya okubanzi emgwaqeni, futhi ngizwe imisindo yezingilazi ezikhencezayo ngaphakathi. Kodwa qhubeka, Ishmayeli, ngithe ekugcineni; awuzwa? suka phambi komnyango; amabhuzu akho anamachibi amisa indlela. Ngakho ngahamba. Manje ngokucabangela kwami ​​ngangilandela imigwaqo eyayingiyisa emanzini, ngoba lapho, ngokungangabazeki, kwakuyizindawo ezingabizi kakhulu, uma kungezona izindawo zokulala ezijabulisa kakhulu.

       Izitaladi ezimbi kangaka! amabhulokhi amnyama, hhayi izindlu, ngakwesinye isandla, futhi lapha nalaphaya ikhandlela, njengekhandlela elihambahamba ethuneni. Kulelihora lobusuku, losuku lokugcina lwesonto, leyo kota yedolobha yabonakala ingenamuntu. Kodwa manje ngafika ekukhanyeni okushunqa intuthu kuphuma esakhiweni esiphansi, esibanzi, umnyango waso owawumi uvulekile ngendlela ehehayo. Yayibukeka ngokunganaki, njengokungathi yayihloselwe ukusetshenziswa umphakathi; ngakho, ngingena, into yokuqala engiyenzile kwaba ukukhubeka phezu kwebhokisi lomlotha kuvulandi.

       Ibhokisi?—I-Spouter?—Into esabekayo kulokho kuxhumana, ngacabanga kanjalo I. Kodwa igama elivamile eNantucket, bathi, futhi ngicabanga ukuthi lo Petru lapha ungowokufika osuka lapho. Njengoba ukukhanya kwakubukeka kufiphele kakhulu, nendawo, ngaleso sikhathi, yayibukeka ithule ngokwanele, futhi indlu encane ewohlokayo yamapulangwe ngokwayo yayibukeka sengathi yayikade ithwelwe lapha isuka emanxiweni esifunda esithile esishile, futhi njengoba uphawu olujikayo lwalune Ukuhlupheka, ngacabanga ukuthi nansi indawo yokuhlala eshibhile, kanye nekhofi eliphambili lephizi.

       Kwakuyindawo ewubukhazikhazi—indlu endala enesaga, uhlangothi olulodwa lukhubazekile njengokungathi, futhi incike phezu ngokudabukisayo. Wema ekhoneni elimnyama elicijile, lapho isivunguvungu sase-Euroklydon saqhubeka sivunguza kakhulu kunanini ngaphambili mayelana nomkhumbi ompofu kaPawulu wokujikijelwa. I-Euroclydon, nokho, iyi-zephyr emnandi enamandla kunoma ubani ongaphakathi endlini, izinyawo zakhe ziphezu kwehhashi zibhodla ngokuthula ukuze zilale. “Endabeni yalowo moya oyisiphepho obizwa ngokuthi i-Euroclydon,” kusho umlobi omdala—enginayo okuwukuphela kwekhophi esele yezincwadi zakhe—“wenza umehluko omangalisayo, kungakhathaliseki ukuthi uwubuka ngefasitela eliyingilazi lapho isithwathwa sigcwele khona. ngaphandle, noma ukubheka kulelofasitela elingenamashi, lapho isithwathwa sikhona nhlangothi zombili, futhi okuwukuphela kwalo okuwubukhazikhazi Ukufa.” Yiqiniso, ngicabanga, njengoba le ndima ifika engqondweni yami—uhlamvu olumnyama oludala, ucabanga kahle. Yebo, lamehlo angamafasitela, futhi lomzimba wami uyindlu. Okubuhlungu kakhulu ukuthi abazange bavimbe ama-chink kanye nama-crannies, futhi bafaka uhlaka oluncane lapha nalapha. Kodwa sekwephuzile kakhulu ukwenza intuthuko manje. Umkhathi uphelile; i-copestone ivuliwe, futhi ama-chips akhishwa eminyakeni eyisigidi edlule. ULazaru ompofu lapho, ekhuluma amazinyo akhe phezu kwetshe lonqenqema lomcamelo, futhi eqhaqha izindebe zakhe ngokuqhaqhazela kwakhe, angase abophe izikhwebu zombili ngamanikiniki, futhi afake isikhwebu sommbila emlonyeni wakhe, kodwa nokho lokho kwakungeke kumvimbe. i-Euroclydon enesiphepho. I-Euroclidon! kusho u-Dives omdala, egoqweni lakhe elibomvu likasilika—(wayenelinye elibomvu kamuva) pooh, pooh! Ubusuku obuhle obunesithwathwa; indlela i-Orion ekhazimula ngayo; yeka izibani zasenyakatho! Mabakhulume ngezimo zabo ezishisayo zasehlobo zaseMpumalanga zezindawo zokulondoloza imvelo zaphakade; nginike ilungelo lokuzenzela ihlobo lami ngamalahle ami.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa ucabangani uLazaru? Angakwazi yini ukufudumala izandla zakhe eziluhlaza ngokuziphakamisela ezibanini ezinhle zasenyakatho? ULazaru ubengeke yini abe seSumatra kunalapha? Wayengeke yini ambeke phansi ngobude ngomugqa wenkabazwe; yebo, nina bonkulunkulu! yehlele egodini lomlilo uqobo, ukuze unqande lesi sithwathwa?
    </p>
    <p>
       Manje, ukuthi uLazaru kufanele alale elele lapho phezu kwetshe lonqenqema phambi komnyango we-Dives, lokhu kuhle kakhulu kunokuba intaba yeqhwa iboshelwe kwenye yeMoluccas. Nokho uDives uqobo lwakhe, naye uphila njengoCzar esigodlweni seqhwa esakhiwe ngokububula okuqinile, futhi engumongameli womphakathi othobekile, uphuza kuphela izinyembezi ezishisayo zezintandane.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa akusekho lokhu kubhuqa manje, sesihamba ngomkhomo, futhi kuningi kwalokho okuseza. Ake sikhiphe iqhwa ezinyaweni zethu eziqhwaqhwa, futhi sibone ukuthi lesi “Spouter” singaba yindawo enjani.

       Ungena kuleyo Spouter-Inn ene-gable, uzithole usendaweni ebanzi, ephansi, edonsa kanzima enama-wainscot ayisidala, okukhumbuza enye izindonga zemisebenzi yezandla endala elahliwe. Ngakolunye uhlangothi kwakulenga upende omkhulu kakhulu kawoyela owawushunqiswe kahle, futhi zonke izindlela zonakalisiwe, kangangokuthi ezibanini ezingalingani obubuke ngazo, kwaba kuphela ngokutadisha ngenkuthalo nochungechunge lokuvakashela kuyo ngendlela ehlelekile, kanye nokubuza ngokucophelela komakhelwane, ukuthi ungafinyelela nganoma iyiphi indlela ekuqondeni injongo yawo. Izixuku ezinjalo ezingenakuziphendulela zemithunzi nezithunzi, ukuthi ekuqaleni ucishe wacabanga ukuthi umculi osemusha owayenesifiso sokuvelela, ngesikhathi sama-hags aseNew England, wayezame ukudalula isiphithiphithi esiloyiwe. Kodwa ngokucabanga okuningi nokuqotho, kanye nokuzindla okuphindaphindiwe, futhi ikakhulukazi ngokuvula iwindi elincane elibheke ngemuva kwendawo yokungena, ekugcineni ufinyelela esiphethweni sokuthi umbono onjalo, noma ngabe uyingozi kangakanani, ungase ungabi ngokungafanelekile ngokuphelele.

       Kodwa okwakukudide kakhulu futhi kukudide kakhulu kwakuyinqwaba ende, eyisithombo, ebabazekayo, emnyama ezungeza phakathi nendawo yesithombe phezu kwemigqa emithathu eluhlaza okwesibhakabhaka, elufifi, ne-perpendicular entanta imvubelo engenagama. Isithombe esididayo, esimangele, esinezinqe ngempela, esanele ukushayela indoda ethukile ephazamisekile. Noma kunjalo bekukhona uhlobo olungapheli, olufinyelelwe engxenyeni, olungenakucatshangwa mayelana nalo olwakumisa kukho, waze wafunga ngokuzenzakalelayo ukuze uthole ukuthi lowo mdwebo omangalisayo wawusho ukuthini.

Eminye yayiminyene inamazinyo akhazimulayo afana namasaha ezinyo lendlovu; ezinye zazifakwe amafindo ezinwele zomuntu; futhi enye yayimise okwesikela, inesibambo esikhulu esishanelayo njengengxenye eyenziwe otshanini obusha obugundiwe ngumsiki omude ohlomile. Waqhaqhazela lapho ugqolozela, futhi wazibuza ukuthi iyiphi i-zimuzimu esabekayo kanye nesihluku esingase sakwazi ukuvuna ukufa ngesisetshenziswa sokugebenga, nesabisa kangaka. Kuhlanganiswe nalokhu kwakugqwalile imikhombe emidala yama-whaling namahabhu aphukile futhi akhubazekile. Ezinye kwakuyizikhali eziyimbali.

Akukho lutho ngaphandle kwamakhandlela amabili afiphele, ngalinye liseshidini elisongayo. Sasizimisele ngokucindezela amabhantshi ethu ezinkawu, futhi sibambelele ezindebeni zethu izinkomishi zetiye elivuthayo ngeminwe yethu eqandisiwe. Kodwa imali yokugibela yayiyinhle kakhulu—hhayi inyama namazambane kuphela, kodwa namadombolo; mazulu amahle! amadombolo esidlweni sakusihlwa! Enye insizwa egqoke ijazi eliluhlaza, yazibhekisa kulawa madombolo ngendlela esabekayo.

       Njengamanje kuzwakale umsindo oxokozelayo ngaphandle. Eqala phezulu, umnikazi wendawo wakhala, “Lelo yiqembu le-Grampus. Ngimbone esebikiwe kusasa kulokhu ukusa; uhambo lweminyaka emithathu, nomkhumbi ogcwele. Hurrah, bafana; manje sesizoba nezindaba zakamuva ezivela kwabakwaFeegees.”

       Kuzwakale ukunyathelwa kwamabhuzu olwandle lapho kungena khona; umnyango wawuvuleke, futhi kugingqwe iqoqo lamatilosi asendle ngokwanele. Bembozwe amajazi abo amawashi anobukhazikhazi, futhi amakhanda abo evalwe ngeziduduzi zoboya, bonke bedakiwe futhi bemanikiniki, nentshebe yabo iqinile ngenxa yeqhwa, babonakala beqhuma amabhere avela eLabrador. Babesanda kwehla esikebheni, futhi lena kwakuyindlu yokuqala abangena kuyo. Khona-ke, akumangalisi ukuthi bawubuka ngokuqondile umlomo womkhomo—indawo yokugezela—ngenkathi uJona osekhulile owayeshwabene, owayelapho, ewathulula ama-brimmers nxazonke. Omunye wakhononda ngomkhuhlane omubi ekhanda lakhe, lapho uJona amxubela khona isithako esifana nesamanzi se-gin nama-molasses, afunga ukuthi wayeyikhambi elibusayo layo yonke imikhuhlane kanye ne-catarrh, akanandaba nokuthi wayemi isikhathi eside kangakanani, noma ukuthi uyabanjwa. ogwini lwaseLabrador, noma ohlangothini lwezulu lwesiqhingi seqhwa.

       Ngokushesha uphuzo oludakayo lwangena emakhanda abo, njengoba ngokuvamile lwenzeka ngisho nasezindaweni ezishisayo ezisanda kufika olwandle, futhi baqala ukudansa kakhulu.

       Ngabona nokho ukuthi omunye wabo wayezibambele mathupha, futhi nakuba wayebonakala engafuni ukumosha injabulo yabahamba nabo ngomkhumbi ngobuso bakhe obuzothile, nokho kukho konke wakugwema ukubanga umsindo njengabanye. Le ndoda yangithakasela ngaso leso sikhathi; futhi njengoba onkulunkulu basolwandle babemmisile ukuthi ngokushesha abe umsizi wami womkhumbi (nakuba kodwa umlingani olalayo, ngokwalokhu kulandisa), ngizozama lapha ekuchazeni okuncane ngaye. Wayema ​​egcwele izinyawo eziyisithupha ukuphakama, namahlombe ahloniphekile, nesifuba esifana nedamu lebhokisi. Angikaze ngibone endodeni eganga kangaka. Ubuso bakhe babunsundu ngokujulile futhi bushile, okwenza amazinyo akhe amhlophe acwebezele ngokuhlukana; ngenkathi ethunzini elijulile lamehlo akhe kwakuntanta ezinye izikhumbuzo ezazibonakala zingamniki injabulo enkulu. Izwi lakhe ngaso leso sikhathi lamemezela ukuthi ungowaseNingizimu, futhi ngenxa yesiqu sakhe esihle, ngacabanga ukuthi kumelwe ukuba ungomunye walabo baqwali bezintaba abade base-Alleghanian Ridge eVirginia. Kuthe uma isidlondlobele sabangane bakhe senyukela phezulu, lendoda yashibilika ingabonwa muntu, angibange ngisayibona yaze yaba umngane wami olwandle. Nokho, emizuzwini embalwa, waphuthelwa ababehamba naye emkhunjini, futhi njengoba, kubonakala, ngesizathu esithile eyintandokazi enkulu nabo, baphakamisa isililo esithi “Bulkington! I-Bulkington! iphi i-Bulkington?” waphuma endlini emjaha.
    </p>
    <p>
       It was now about nine o&#39;clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
       No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. I don&#39;t know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
    </p>
    <p>
       The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord! I&#39;ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan&#39;t sleep with him. I&#39;ll try the bench here.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Just as you please; I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it&#39;s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I&#39;ve got a carpenter&#39;s plane there in the bar—wait, I say, and I&#39;ll make ye snug enough.” So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven&#39;s sake to quit—the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
       I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.
    </p>
    <p>
       The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn&#39;t I steal a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
    </p>
    <p>
       Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person&#39;s bed, I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I&#39;ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long. I&#39;ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there&#39;s no telling.
    </p>
    <p>
       But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o&#39;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
       The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he answered, “generally he&#39;s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to rise—yes, he&#39;s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don&#39;t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can&#39;t sell his head.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Can&#39;t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “That&#39;s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn&#39;t sell it here, the market&#39;s overstocked.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “With what?” shouted I.
    </p>
    <p>
       “With heads to be sure; ain&#39;t there too many heads in the world?”

    <p>
       “I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you&#39;d better stop spinning that yarn to me—I&#39;m not green.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther guess you&#39;ll be done 
      <i>
        brown
      </i>
       if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin&#39; his head.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I&#39;ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord&#39;s.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It&#39;s broke a&#39;ready,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Broke,” said I—“ 
      <i>
        broke
      </i>
       , do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sartain, and that&#39;s the very reason he can&#39;t sell it, I guess.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I&#39;ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, 
      <i>
        you
      </i>
       I mean, landlord, 
      <i>
        you
      </i>
       , sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that&#39;s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin&#39; you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of &#39;balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he&#39;s sold all on &#39;em but one, and that one he&#39;s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow&#39;s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin&#39; human heads about the streets when folks is goin&#39; to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin&#39; out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.”
    </p>
    <p>
       This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “He pays reg&#39;lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it&#39;s getting dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes—it&#39;s a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There&#39;s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it&#39;s an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn&#39;t do. Come along here, I&#39;ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it&#39;s Sunday—you won&#39;t see that harpooneer to-night; he&#39;s come to anchor somewhere—come along then; 
      <i>
        do
      </i>
       come; 
      <i>
        won&#39;t
      </i>
       ye come?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
       “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman&#39;s bag, containing the harpooneer&#39;s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
       But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
       I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer&#39;s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
       Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag&#39;s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes, it&#39;s just as I thought, he&#39;s a terrible bedfellow; he&#39;s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It&#39;s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun&#39;s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
       Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years&#39; War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!
    </p>
    <p>
       But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days&#39; old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
    </p>
    <p>
       I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
       All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.
    </p>
    <p>
       But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
    </p>
    <p>
       Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.” And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord, for God&#39;s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Don&#39;t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn&#39;t harm a hair of your head.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn&#39;t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I thought ye know&#39;d it;—didn&#39;t I tell ye, he was a peddlin&#39; heads around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
       “You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What&#39;s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself—the man&#39;s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don&#39;t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It&#39;s dangerous. Besides, I ain&#39;t insured.”
    </p>
    <p>
       This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to say—“I won&#39;t touch a leg of ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
    </p>
    <p>
       I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
