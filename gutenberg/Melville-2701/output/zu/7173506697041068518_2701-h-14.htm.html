Wabona abathandi abavalelekile lapho begxuma emkhunjini wabo ovuthayo; inhliziyo enhliziyweni yacwila ngaphansi kwegagasi le-ebtulting; Ngokweqiniso, lapho izulu lalibonakala linamanga kubo. Wabona umlingani obulawayo lapho ephonswa yiPirates emphemeni wamaphakathi kwamabili; Kwaphela amahora amaningi wangena phakathi kobusuku obujulile be-maw ebaluleke kakhulu; Futhi ababulali bakhe basangena ngomkhumbi bengalimalanga - lapho imibani esheshayo yathuthumela khona lapho bekungathi umkhuhlane owumakhelwane owayezothwala umyeni olungile ukuze welulele, walangazelela izingalo. O Head! Ubonile ngokwanele ukuba uhlukanise amaplanethi wenza nokhoba u-Abrahama, futhi akukho okuvumelanisa noyedwa! &quot;

       ISAHLUKO 71. Indaba kaJerobowamu.

       Isandla ngesandla, umkhumbi kanye nomoya ovunguzayo; Kepha umoya wafika ngokushesha kunomkhumbi, futhi maduze nje i-pequod yaqala ukuzamazama.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngokunjalo, ngengilazi ezikebheni ezingabafokazi kanye namakhanda omdanso abonakele kungumkhumbi. Kepha njengoba ayeze avuke futhi adubule, ngokusobala enza isigaba esithile esithile, i-pequod ayikwazanga ukuthemba ukumfinyelela. Ngakho-ke isiginali sahlelwa ukubona ukuthi izokwenziwa yini impendulo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nakhu kushiwo, ukuthi njengezitsha zemikhumbi yezempi, imikhumbi yemikhumbi ye-American Whale inesiginali ngasinye; Bonke abasayina abaqoqiwe encwadini enamagama athile anamathiselwe, wonke ukaputeni unikezwa ngakho. Ngaleyo ndlela, abaphathi be-Whale banikwe amandla ukubonana kolwandle, ngisho nasekude nasekude nasendaweni encane.

       Isiginali kaPequod ekugcineni saphendulwa ngokusenza sayo; okwakufakazela umkhumbi ukuba nguJeroboam waseNantucket. Agxeka amayadi akhe, wazala phansi, wasuka wagijima ngaphansi kwe-pequod&#39;s Lee, wehlisa isikebhe; Ngokushesha kwasondela; Kepha, njengoba ileli ecelenimelo eliseceleni laligqekezwa yi-Starbuck&#39;s Order ukuze lamukele umkaputeni ovakashile, umfokazi okukhulunywa ngawo wasusa isandla sakhe ngemuva kophawu lwesikejana sakhe sokuthi lungadingekile ngokuphelele. Kwavela ukuthi uJerobowamu wayenesifo esibi ebhodini, futhi leyo maye, ukaputeni wayo, wayesaba ukuletha inkampani ye-PEQOOD. Ngoba, noma iqembu lesikebhe lalihlala lingaziwa, futhi yize umkhumbi wakhe wayezihlubuke isibhamu, nolwandle olungenakonakala nomoya osongelayo nokugeleza phakathi; Noma kunjalo ukunamathela ngenkathazo ngokuhlukaniswa ngamahloni kwezwe, wenqaba ngokuqondile ukufika ngqo ne-PEQOOD.

       Kepha lokhu akuzange kube khona kungavimba konke ukuxhumana. Ukugcina isikhathi sokuphumula kwamamitha athile ambalwa phakathi kwawo kanye nomkhumbi, isikebhe sikaJerobowamu ngokusetshenziswa kwezikhathi zokusetshenziswa kwaso ukuze sikwazi ukuhambisana nolwandle, njengoba kwakha khona kakhulu olwandle (ngoba ngalesi sikhathi kwavutha kakhulu), nge mangena lakhe eliphambili eliphakeme; Kodwa-ke, ngezinye izikhathi, ngezinye izikhathi ngokuqala kwegagasi elikhulu lokugoqa, isikebhe sasiqhutshwa ngendlela ezayo; Kepha kwakuzokwenziwa ngobuhlakani ngokushesha ukubhekelwa kwakhe okufanele. Kuncike kulokhu, nokunye ukuphazamiseka okufana manje kanye, kwenziwa ingxoxo phakathi kwalawa maqembu womabili; Kepha ngezikhathi ezithile hhayi ngaphandle kokuphazamiseka okuhluke kakhulu.

       Ukudonsa i-OAR esikebheni sikaJerobowamu, kwakuyindoda yokubukeka komuntu, ngisho nakule ndlela yokuphila yasendle lapho umuntu enokwenzeka khona enze bonke abasebudlelwaneni. Wayeyindoda encane, emfushane, esesincane, wafafaza bonke phezu kobuso bakhe ngama-freckles, futhi egqoke izinwele eziphuzi ezingafuneki. Ijazi elikhudlwana, elinqunywe ngesiko le-walnut tinge ammbona; Imikhono egcwele ebiyelwe izihlakala zayo. I-delirium ejulile, ehlekile, enentshiseko yayise emehlweni akhe.

       Ngakho-ke maduze nje lapho lesi sibalo sase sidangele okokuqala, uStubb wayebakhaze- &quot;nguyena lowo! Lowo nguye! I-Stubb lapha ibhekisa endabeni eyinqaba ebika uJerobowamu, nomuntu othile phakathi kwabasebenzi bayo, isikhathi esithile esedlule lapho i-PEPEQOOD ikhuluma lo muzi - ho. Ngokwale ndaba futhi kamuva kwafundwa kamuva, kwabonakala sengathi uScankch okukhulunywa ngawo wawutholile ekhuphukayo amahle ngaphezu kwawo wonke umuntu kuJerobowamu. Indaba yakhe yile:

       Wayesekhuliswa ekuqaleni phakathi kwenhlangano ehlanyayo yeNeskyeuna Shikers, lapho ayekade engumprofethi omkhulu; Emihlanganweni yazo eqhekekile, imfihlo enezikhathi eziningana isuka ezulwini ngendlela yomnyango wesicupho, imemezela ukuvulwa okusheshayo kwe-vial yesikhombisa, eyayithwala ephaketheni lakhe le-vest; Kepha, okuthi, esikhundleni sokuba nesibhamu, bekufanele kuthweswe icala ngeLaudanum. UWilwing ongaziwa, owayengumphostoli, wayeseshiye uNeskyeuna waseNeskyeuna, lapho, khona, wathatha ubuhlakani obungajwayelekile, wathatha umfutho oqinile, ojwayelekile, wazinikela njengokhetho oluhlaza okotshani oluhlaza okotshani lweJerobowamu. Bamfakazele; Kepha masinyane lapho kuphuma khona umkhumbi phambi komhlaba, ubuhlanya bakhe baqubuka endaweni yokuphumula. Uzimemezele njengengelosi enkulu uGabriel, wayala ukaputeni ukuba afinyelele ngaphezulu. Washicilela i-manifesto yakhe, lapho azibeka khona njengoMkhululi weziqhingi zolwandle kanye no-Vicar-General wazo zonke izilwandle olwandle. Ubuqotho obungelona obukhohlakele amemezele ngalo lezi zinto; -Umnyama, odlanayo odlalwa ngomcabango wakhe wokungalali, futhi zonke izinkamba zangempela ze-delirium zangempela, ezihlangene nokutshala imali le Gabriel ezingqondweni zeningi labasebenzi abangenalwazi, nge umoya wobungcwele. Ngaphezu kwalokho, babemesaba. Njengomuntu onjalo, nokho, kwakungewona ukusetshenziswa okungokoqobo emkhunjini, ikakhulukazi njengoba enqaba ukusebenza ngaphandle kwalapho ethanda, ukapukezi olwehlaselayo wayeyomsusa; Kepha kuhlinzekelwe ukuthi inhloso yomuntu ngamunye bekuwumzalela ethekwini lokuqala elilula, ingilosi enkulu yavula zonke izimpawu zayo kanye nama-vials - ukunikela ngomkhumbi kanye nazo zonke izandla zenzeke. Wasebenza kakhulu abafundi bakhe phakathi kwabasebenzi bakhe, lapho baye ekaputeni bamtshela ukuthi uGabriyeli wathunyelwa yini emkhunjini, hhayi umuntu wazo owayengasalali. Ngakho-ke waphoqeleka ukuba ayeke icebo lakhe. Futhi ngeke bavumele ukuthi uGabriyeli abe yindlela engabi nalutho, asho noma enze lokho ayezokwenza; Ngakho-ke kwenzeka ukuthi uGabriel wayenenkululeko ephelele yomkhumbi. Umphumela wakho konke lokhu, ukuthi ingelosi enkulu inakekele kancane noma lutho ngokaputeni kanye nabalingani; Futhi njengoba ubhubhane lwaludliwe, waphatha isandla esiphakeme kunangaphambili; Ukumemezela ukuthi inhlupheko, njengoba ayebiza ngayo, wayekude nomyalo wakhe; futhi akufanele ihlale kodwa ngokwentando yakhe enhle. Amatilosi, iningi lamademoni ampofu, ahlotshisiwe, nabanye babo baphambi kwakhe; Ukulalela imiyalo yakhe, kwesinye isikhathi ukumhlonipha, njengoNkulunkulu. Izinto ezinjalo zingahle zibonakale zingezinhle; Kepha, kepha-ke uyamangalisa, aqinisile. Futhi umlando we-anatics uhhafu ohlaba umxhwele maqondana nokuzikhohlisa okungenakuqhathaniswa kokwazi kwakhe ngokwakhe, njengamandla akhe angenamaphakathi nokukhohlisa abanye. Kepha sekuyisikhathi sokubuyela ePequod.

       “Angesabi isifo sakho, ndoda,” kusho u-Ahabi esenqabeni, kuKaputeni Mayhew, owayemi ngemuva kwesikebhe; &quot;Woza ebhodini.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Kepha manje uGabriyeli waqala ezinyaweni zakhe.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Cabanga, cabanga nge-fever, ephuzi futhi ebabayo! Qaphela isifo esibi!”
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;UGabriel! UGabriel! &quot; wakhala uCaptain Mayha; &quot;Kumelwe noma khona-ke-&quot; kodwa lokho ngokushesha kwadubula isikebhe esikude, nokubona kwaso kwashona yonke inkulumo.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Ubonile umkhomo omhlophe?&quot; wafuna u-Ahabi, lapho isikebhe sibuyela emuva.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Cabanga, cabanga ngesikebhe sakho somkhomo, uStoven washona! Qaphela ngomsila owesabekayo! &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Ngiphinde ngithi, Gabriel, lokho-&quot; Kepha isikebhe saphinde saklebhuka ngokungathi sidonswa yi-fiends. Akukho lutho olwalushiwo ngezikhathi ezithile, kuyilapho ukulandelana kwamagagasi avuselelwayo kugingqika, ngenye yalezo zindawo zolwandle ngezikhathi ezithile zayahla, zingalithuli. Ngaleso sikhathi, ikhanda le-sperm whale elicwebezelwe ligijime ngokuhlukunyezwa, futhi uGabriel wabonakala engena emveleni ngokusobala kunemvelo yakhe yasebukhosini yakhe abonakala egunyaza.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lapho lokhu kuhlangana sekuphelile, uCaptain Mayphew waqala indaba emnyama ephathelene ne-Moby Dick; Hhayi, noma kunjalo, ngaphandle kokuphazamiseka njalo kuGabriel, noma nini lapho kukhulunywa ngegama lakhe, futhi ulwandle oluhlanya lwalubonakala lugcwele khona.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kwabonakala sengathi uJerobowamu akazange ahambe isikhathi eside ekhaya, lapho ekhuluma umkhuhlane, abantu bakhe bahlushwa ngokuthembekile ngenxa yokuba khona kuka-Moby Dick, kanye ne-Havoc ayenzile. Ukungena ngokuhaha kulobu buhlakani, uGabriel waxwayisa kakhulu ukaputeni ngokuhlasela umhlophe omhlophe, uma kwenzeka kubonakale isilo; Ekuhlaselweni kwe-gibbering yakhe, ememezela umkhomo omhlophe ukuthi angaphansi kwesidalwa esingaphansi kukaNkulunkulu oshisekayo; AbakwaShakers bathola iBhayibheli. Kepha nini, ngonyaka owodwa noma emibili ngemuva kwalokho, i-Moby Dick yabona kahle emakhanda amabi, eMacey, umlingani ophambili, eshisiwe nge-ardor yokuhlangana naye; Futhi ukaputeni ngokwakhe akafuni ukumvumela ukuba abe nethuba, naphezu kwazo zonke izindunduma zengelosi yezingelosi, uMacey waphumelela ukukholisa amadoda amahlanu ezweni lesikebhe sakhe. Wasunduza ngabo; Futhi, ngemuva kokukhathele kakhulu, futhi eziningi ezinobungozi, ezingaphumeleli, ekugcineni, ekugcineni kwaphumelela ukuthola insimbi eyodwa ngokushesha. Ngaleso sikhathi, uGabriel, ekhuphukela ekhanda le-Mast-Royal-Royal, wayephonsa ingalo eyodwa ekushukunyisweni okukhulu, futhi aphonsele iziprofetho zesakhiwo esisheshayo kubahlaseli bakhe. Manje, ngenkathi uMacey, umngane womshado, wayesukuma emnsalo wakhe wesiketi, futhi ngawo wonke la mandla angenangqondo esizwe sakhe sasikhipha isimemezelo sakhe sasendle phezu komkhomo, futhi ethanda ukuthola ithuba elifanelekileyo, bheka! Isithunzi esimhlophe esibanzi sakhula olwandle; Ngokunyakaza kwayo okusheshayo, okusheshayo, ukuthatha umphefumulo okwesikhashana emizimbeni yabafowethu. Ngokushesha, oshade naye ngenhlanhla, bagcwele impilo emnandi, bashaywa emzimbeni emoyeni, futhi bashaye i-arc ende emzaneni wakhe, bawela olwandle ngakude ngamabanga amahlanu. Hhayi i-chip yesikejana yalimala, noma izinwele zanoma yiliphi ikhanda le-oarsiman; Kepha umlingani wake washona.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kuhle ku-Parenthize lapha, enezingozi ezibulalayo emfinjini ye-Scekum-whale, lolu hlobo mhlawumbe lucishe lube njalo njengokunye. Ngezinye izikhathi, akukho lutho olulimazayo ngaphandle komuntu obhujiswe kanjalo; kaningi umcibisholo womkhumbi ugetshengwa, noma ithanga, lapho undunankulu ami khona, liyadatshulwa endaweni yalo lihambisane nomzimba. Kodwa okuxakayo kunakho konke isimo, ukuthi ezimweni eziningi kunesisodwa, lapho umzimba usutholakele, akukho nolulodwa uphawu lobudlova olubonakalayo; indoda isifile bhuqe.
    </p>
    <p>
       Yonke inhlekelele, ngesimo sokuwa kweMacey, yachazwa ngokusobala emkhunjini. Ephakamisa izwi elihlabayo—“Isitsha! ibhodlela!” UGabriel waxosha izisebenzi ezazihlaselwe amaphekula ekuzingeleni okwengeziwe komkhomo. Lesi senzakalo esibi sembesa ingelosi enkulu ithonya elengeziwe; ngoba abafundi bakhe abakhohlakali babekholelwa ukuthi wayekumemezele kusengaphambili, esikhundleni sokwenza nje isiprofetho esivamile, okungenzeka noma ubani wasenza, futhi babe nethuba lokushaya elinye lamamaki amaningi emkhawulweni obanzi ovunyelwe. Waba uvalo olungenagama emkhunjini.
    </p>
    <p>
       U-Mayhew esephethe ukulandisa kwakhe, u-Ahabi wambuza imibuzo enjalo, kangangokuthi ukaputeni ongaziwa wayengakwazi ukukuyeka ukubuza ukuthi wayehlose ukuzingela i-White Whale, uma ithuba livela. U-Ahabi waphendula wathi, “Yebo.” Khona-ke, uGabriel waphinda futhi wema ngezinyawo, waligqolozela ikhehla, futhi wababaza ngokunamandla, ngomunwe obheke phansi—“Cabanga, cabanga ngomhlambalazi—ofile, futhi laphaya phansi!— qaphela isiphetho salo mhlambalazi!
    </p>
    <p>
       U-Ahabi washesha waphambuka; wabe esethi kuMayhew, “Kapteni, ngisanda kungicabangela isikhwama sami sezincwadi; kukhona incwadi yesinye sezikhulu zakho, uma ngingaphosisi. Starbuck, bheka phezu kwesikhwama.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Wonke umkhumbi we-whale ukhipha inombolo enhle yezinhlamvu zemikhumbi ehlukahlukene, ukulethwa kwazo kubantu okungase kubhekiswe kubo, kuncike ethubeni lokuhlangana nazo olwandle olune. Ngakho, izinhlamvu eziningi azifinyeleli uphawu lwazo; futhi eziningi zitholwa kuphela ngemva kokuthola iminyaka emibili noma emithathu noma ngaphezulu.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngokushesha u-Starbuck wabuya nencwadi esandleni sakhe. Yayiwa kabuhlungu, imanzi, futhi imbozwe ngesikhunta esilufifi, esinamabala, esiluhlaza, ngenxa yokugcinwa ekhabetheni elimnyama. Encwadini enjalo, uKufa ngokwakhe kungenzeka ukuthi wayengumfana weposi.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Awukwazi ukuyifunda?” wakhala u-Ahabi. “Nginike ndoda. Yebo, yebo, ukuklwebha okufiphele nje;—yini lokhu?” Lapho ewutadisha, u-Starbuck wathatha isigxobo eside sokusika, futhi ngommese wakhe wahlukanisa kancane isiphetho, ukuze afake uhlamvu lapho, futhi ngaleyo ndlela, alunikeze isikebhe, ngaphandle kokusondela kwaso eduze nomkhumbi. .
    </p>
    <p>
       Phakathi naleso sikhathi, u-Ahabi ephethe incwadi, wabubula, “Mnu. Har—yebo, Mnu. Harry—(isandla somuntu wesifazane,—unkosikazi walendoda, ngizobheja)—Aye—Mnu. UHarry Macey, umkhumbi uJerobowamu;—kungani nguMacey, futhi ufile!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Mfondini! bandla! nakumkakhe,” kububula uMahew; &quot;kodwa ake ngithathe.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hhayi, zigcine,” kumemeza uGabriyeli ku-Ahabi; “thou art soon going that way.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck&#39;s hands, he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship&#39;s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel&#39;s eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab&#39;s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
       As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair.

       CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale&#39;s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster&#39;s back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Being the savage&#39;s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale&#39;s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the ship&#39;s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
       It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to Queequeg&#39;s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.
    </p>
    <p>
       So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another&#39;s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg&#39;s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*
    </p>
    <p>
       *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
    </p>
    <p>
       And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.

       Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg&#39;s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
    </p>
    <p>
       Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
    </p>
    <p>
       But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. “Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you please.” Then watching the mate&#39;s countenance, he added, “The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we&#39;ll teach you to drug a harpooneer; none of your apothecary&#39;s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the captain&#39;s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a whale.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don&#39;t hit him again, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that sort; and this fellow&#39;s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity&#39;s gift, and that was freely given to the waves.

       CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk over Him.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale&#39;s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod&#39;s side. But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats, Stubb&#39;s and Flask&#39;s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel&#39;s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale&#39;s body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock.
    </p>
    <p>
       At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he turned upon his back a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
       While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation ensued between them.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat&#39;s bow, “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale&#39;s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale&#39;s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
       “I don&#39;t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he seems to know all about ships&#39; charms. But I sometimes think he&#39;ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don&#39;t half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake&#39;s head, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship? He&#39;s the devil, I say. The reason why you don&#39;t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he&#39;s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “He sleeps in his boots, don&#39;t he? He hasn&#39;t got any hammock; but I&#39;ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No doubt, and it&#39;s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye see, in the eye of the rigging.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bargain?—about what?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he&#39;ll surrender Moby Dick.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I don&#39;t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, &#39;I want John.&#39; &#39;What for?&#39; says the old governor. &#39;What business is that of yours,&#39; says the devil, getting mad,—&#39;I want to use him.&#39; &#39;Take him,&#39; says the governor—and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn&#39;t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I&#39;ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp—ain&#39;t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let&#39;s get the whale alongside.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship, “but I can&#39;t remember where.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn&#39;t the devil live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral&#39;s cabin, don&#39;t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that&#39;s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod&#39;s hold, and string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn&#39;t begin to be Fedallah&#39;s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn&#39;t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he&#39;s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me that?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But he&#39;d crawl back.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and drown you—what then?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I should like to see him try it; I&#39;d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn&#39;t dare to show his face in the admiral&#39;s cabin again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I&#39;m afraid of the devil? Who&#39;s afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn&#39;t catch him and put him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he&#39;d roast for him? There&#39;s a governor!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do I suppose it? You&#39;ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going on, I&#39;ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look here, Beelzebub, you don&#39;t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I&#39;ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he&#39;ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Didn&#39;t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you&#39;ll soon see this right whale&#39;s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti&#39;s.”
    </p>
    <p>
       In good time, Flask&#39;s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale&#39;s head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke&#39;s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant&#39;s and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.
    </p>
    <p>
       In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale&#39;s head, and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee&#39;s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab&#39;s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.
