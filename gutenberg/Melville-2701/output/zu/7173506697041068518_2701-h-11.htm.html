       &quot;Kakhulu kakhulu ngale ndlela ngedolobha - ho; Ngakho-ke lapho ukuvuza kwakhe kwatholakala kuthola futhi, kwakukhona iqiniso elithile lokukhathazeka okuncane okubonakaliswa yizinhlangano zakhe eziningana; ikakhulukazi nge-radney umlingani. Wayala ukuthi amaseyili aphezulu azophakanyiswa, aqede, futhi zonke izindlela zandiswa zibe nomoya. Manje lo Radney, ngicabanga ukuthi, wayeyigwala elincane, futhi ethambekele kancane kunoma yiluphi uhlobo lovalo oluthinta umuntu wakhe njenganoma yisiphi isidalwa esingesabi, esingacabangi emhlabeni noma olwandle ongasicabanga kahle, madoda. Ngakho-ke lapho ekhaphela lo nsizwa ngokuphepha komkhumbi, abanye babathumbi bamemezele ukuthi bebelokhu kuphela ngenxa yokuba ngumnikazi wengxenye kuye. Ngakho lapho besebenza ngalobo busuku emaphampu, kwakukhona phezu kwaleli khanda ubulwane obuncane obuchwensayo obuqhubeka phakathi kwabo, njengoba babemi nezinyawo zabo njalo zichichima amanzi acwebile agelezayo; kucace njenganoma yisiphi isiphethu sentaba, madoda—lokho kubhuquza okuvela kumaphampu kwagijima ngaphesheya kompheme, futhi kuzithulula ngokuqhubekayo kuma-lee scupper-holes.

       &quot;Manje, njengoba wazi kahle, akuvamisile ukuthi kunjalo kuleli zwe elijwayelekile lezethu - amanzi noma ngenye indlela; ukuthi lapho umuntu ebeka umyalo kubantu abakanye naye bathola omunye wabo ukuba abe ophakeme kakhulu ngokuphakeme kwakhe ngokuziqhenya kobudoda, masinyane nalo muntu okhulelwa ngokungafanele futhi ungathandi; Futhi uma enethuba lokuthi azodililela phansi adonsele lo mbhoshongo ongezansi, futhi wenza inqwaba yothuli lwayo. Yiba lo mkhuba wami njengoba kungenzeka, manenekazi, kuyo yonke imicimbi ye-steelís kwakuyisilwane eside futhi esihle nentshebe yegolide egeleza njengeshaja yakho yokutholwa ye-viclory ye-viceroy; Futhi ubuchopho, nenhliziyo, nomphefumulo obheke kuye, amanenekazi, ayenze i-fireskilt charlemagne, waze wazalwa ubaba kaCharlemagne. Kodwa uRadney, umngane womshado, wayemubi njengomnyuzi; Noma kunjalo, njengenkani, njengenkabi. Akazange athande i-stecwel, futhi i-steciltetkilt yayazi.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Ukuhlola umngane womshado kusondela njengoba esebenza kanzima empompini nabanye, umLakeman akazange athintwe ukuthi angamboni, kodwa engapheli, eqhubeka nokuphambana kwakhe gay.

       “&#39;Yebo, yebo, bafana bami, ukuvuza okuphilayo lokhu; bamba i-cannikin, omunye wenu, futhi ake sinambithe. NgeNkosi, kufanelekile ukubhodlela! Ngithi nina, abesilisa, ukutshalwa kwezimali okudala kufanele kukuhambele! Wayesenqume kangcono ingxenye yakhe ye-hull futhi ayithobe ekhaya. Iqiniso ngukuthi, abafana, lelo nhlanzi lenkemba kuphela laqala umsebenzi; Ubuye abuye futhi abe neqembu lababangeli lomkhumbi, ababazi, izinhlanzi, nezinhlanzi zefayili, futhi yini hhayi; Futhi yonke i-Posse ye-&#39;M manje inzima ekusikeni komsebenzi nokushaya phansi; Ukwenza intuthuko, ngicabanga. Uma i-rad endala ibikhona manje, ngangimtshela ukuthi agxume ngaphezulu futhi asakaze &#39;em. Badlala uDeveli ngefa lakhe, ngikwazi ukumtshela. Kepha ungumphefumlo omdala olula, -Radi, nobuhle futhi. Abafana, bathi yonke impahla yakhe itshalwe izibuko. Ngiyazibuza ukuthi ngabe unganikeza udeveli ompofu njengami imodeli yekhala lakhe. &#39;

    <p>
       &quot;&#39;Amehlo akho! ithini leyo futha?&#39; URadney obolile, wenza sengathi angezwanga inkulumo kamatilosi. &#39;Ukuduma kwaso!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;&#39;Aye, aye, mnumzane,&#39; kusho uStemilt, mjabulise njengekhilikithi. &#39;Philani, bafana, philani manje!&#39; Futhi ngaleyo mpompo ibambeke ezinjini ezinjengemililo engamashumi amahlanu; Amadoda aphonsa izigqoko zawo kuyo, futhi ubude bawo kangangokuba wazwakala kabi amaphaphu azwakele ukungezwani okugcwele kwamandla amakhulu okuphila.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Ukuyeka impompo ekugcineni, ngawo wonke ibhethri lakhe, umLakeman waya phambili konke egcwele, wahlala phansi phezu komoya; Ubuso bakhe bubomvu, amehlo akhe egazi, bese wesula umjuluko omkhulu esikhundleni sakhe. Manje ukuthi kwakuyini, madoda, ukuthi u-Radney wayenesandla sokugxambukela nendoda ekuleso simo sokucasuka okukhulu, angazi; Kepha kwenzeka kanjalo. Ukuhlupheka ngokusobala eceleni kompheme, umngane womshado wamyala ukuba athole umshanelo akhukhule ngamapulangwe, futhi asuse ezinye izindaba ezihlaselayo lapho evumela ingulube ukuba isebenze.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Manje, manenekazi, ukuklebhula komkhumbi olwandle kungucezu lomsebenzi wasendlini kuzo zonke izikhathi kodwa ama-gales akhuliswa njalo aphilwa kusihlwa njalo; Yaziwa ukuthi yenziwe endabeni yemikhumbi empeleni yaqhamuka ngaleso sikhathi. Okunje, manenekazi, ukuncipha kokusetshenziswa kolwandle nothando lwendalo ngobungcwele ngo-Seamen; Abanye babo bebengeke bamgobhoza ngokuzithandela ngaphandle kokugeza ubuso babo. Kepha kuyo yonke imikhumbi leli bhizinisi lomshanelo liyisifundazwe esibhaliwe sabafana, uma ngabe abafana bebakhona. Ngaphandle kwalokho, kwakungamadoda aqine edolobheni - uHo ayehlukaniswe ngamaqembu ezigebengu, ashintshana emaphampu; Futhi ukuba ngumgijimi wezemidlalo kunabo bonke, i-stemkilt ibikade yabelwa ukaputeni weqembu elilodwa; ngakho-ke bekufanele akhululwe kunoma yiliphi ibhizinisi elincane elingaxhumene nemisebenzi yezolwandle ngempela, njengoba kunjalo namaqabane akhe. Ngikhuluma yonke le mininingwane ukuze uqonde kahle ukuthi lokhu kusho ukuthini phakathi kwalawa madoda amabili.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Kepha kwakukhona okungaphezu kwalokhu: umyalo mayelana nefosholo cishe wawuhloswe ngokucacile ukuthi agwaze futhi athuke insimbi, kube sengathi iRadney ishelile ebusweni bayo. Noma yimuphi umuntu ohambile umkhumbi ngomkhumbi we-whale uzokuqonda lokhu; Futhi konke lokhu futhi ngokungangabazeki, umLakeman waqonda ngokuphelele lapho umlingani ekhuluma umyalo wakhe. Kepha njengoba ayehlala isikhashana, futhi njengoba ebheke ngamehlo asemncane eso futhi ebona izitaki zamakhekhe e-powder-amakhekhe ancipha kuye futhi ahamba kancane ngokuvutha buthule kubo; Njengoba ebonile ngokwemvelo konke lokhu, lokho okubekezelayo okuxakayo nokungathandi ukuqinisa inkanuko ejulile kunoma yiliphi izwe elibusayo - elizwakalayo, lapho bezwakala benonya - lo mqondo ongenagama, lo mnyama, weba phezu kwe-Steelkilt.

       &quot;Ngakho-ke, ngezwi lakhe elijwayelekile, kwaphulwa kancane ngumzimba ukukhathala ngokweqile, wamphendula wathi ukushanela kwathi ukushanela kwalo kwakungelona ibhizinisi lakhe, futhi akavumanga ukukwenza. Khona-ke, ngaphandle kokubhekisela nakancane efosholo, wakhomba abafana abathathu njengabashaneli besintu; Ngubani, engafakwanga amaphampu, ayenze okuncane noma lutho usuku lonke. Kulokhu, uRadneney waphendula ngesifungo, ngendlela ephakeme kakhulu futhi exakile ngokuphindaphinda umyalo wakhe; Ngaleso sikhathi ukuthuthuka kuLakeman osahlala phansi, ngesando se-Cooper&#39;s Club esiphakanyisiwe ayesihlwithe ekhempini esiseduze.

       &quot;Kufuthelwe futhi kucasukile njengoba ebekusebenze kanzima ngamaphampu, kuwo wonke umuzwa wakhe wokuqala engenagama lokubekezelela ukujuluka kwe-steating stealilt kungenzeka kodwa wagula umlingani; Kepha ngandlela thile ngwele ngokukhanyisa ngaphakathi kuye, ngaphandle kokukhuluma wahlala esekelwe esihlalweni sakhe, kuze kube sekupheleni kweRadney evulekile yathuthumela ngesando kungakapheli amasentimitha ambalwa ebusweni bakhe, evuka kakhulu.

       &quot;I-Steel Ukubona, nokho, ukuthi ukubekezela kwakhe kwakungekhona umphumela omncane, ngokubukelwa okubi nokungachazeki ngesandla sakhe esisontekile waxwayisa umuntu oyisiwula nobekiwe; kodwa kwaba ize. Ngale ndlela bobabili bahamba kancane kancane bezungeza umoya; Lapho, ukuxazululwa ekugcineni akusekho ukubuyela emuva, ukumgxeka kangangokuba wenqabe manje njengoba kwenza amahlaya akhe, umLakeman wamisa izibopho futhi ngaleyo ndlela wakhuluma nesikhulu:
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;&#39;Mnu. URadney, ngeke ngikulalele. Thatha leso silam ngesando, noma ubheke wena. &#39; Kepha oshade naye osuselwa kusengaphambili asasondela kuye, lapho umLakeman ayemiswa, manje wanyakazisa isando esindayo ngaphakathi kwamazinyo akhe; Ngaleso sikhathi ukuphinda umucu wokwenziwa okubikulekayo. Ukubuyela emuva kwenkulungwane ye-intshi; Ukumgwaza esweni nge-Phoneiard ye-UNDLINGCHING OKUFUNDIWE, i-steel yakhe, ehlanganisa isandla sakhe sokudla ngemuva kwakhe futhi yayixoxa ngesihlakala, yamtshela isihlathi sakhe kodwa wamdla ngesando. Kepha, manenekazi, isiwula sase sibhalwe uphawu lokuhlatshwa konkulunkulu. Masinyane isando sathinta isihlathi; Ngokushesha osheshayo umhlathi ophansi womngane womshado wasibona ekhanda lakhe; Wawela egazini le-hatch ehamba ngegazi elinjengesikhonzi.

       &quot;Ngashiya, manenekazi, lapho uLakeman wazamazama khona i-backstay. Akukabi nakwenza lokho, lapho ezungezwe abathathu abashade nabo kanye nabathukutheli abane, bonke bamgcwala emphemeni. But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm&#39;s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Come out of that, ye pirates!&#39; roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. &#39;Come out of that, ye cut-throats!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt&#39;s) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?&#39; demanded their ringleader.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!&#39; and he once more raised a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Sink the ship?&#39; cried Steelkilt. &#39;Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say ye, men?&#39; turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.
    </p>
    <p>
       “The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—&#39;It&#39;s not our fault; we didn&#39;t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy&#39;s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw; ain&#39;t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don&#39;t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we&#39;re your men; but we won&#39;t be flogged.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Look ye, now,&#39; cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, &#39;there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the cruise, d&#39;ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don&#39;t want a row; it&#39;s not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won&#39;t be flogged.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Turn to!&#39; roared the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—&#39;I tell you what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won&#39;t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don&#39;t do a hand&#39;s turn.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I&#39;ll keep ye there till ye&#39;re sick of it. Down ye go.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Shall we?&#39; cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
       “As the Lakeman&#39;s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
       “All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
       “At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Better turn to, now?&#39; said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Shut us up again, will ye!&#39; cried Steelkilt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Oh certainly,&#39; said the Captain, and the key clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.
    </p>

       “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. &#39;Damn ye,&#39; cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, &#39;the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the whole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;But as for you, ye carrion rogues,&#39; turning to the three men in the rigging—&#39;for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;&#39; and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;My wrist is sprained with ye!&#39; he cried, at last; &#39;but there is still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn&#39;t give up. Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss, &#39;What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I murder you!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me&#39;—and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Best not,&#39; hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;But I must,&#39;—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, &#39;I won&#39;t do it—let him go—cut him down: d&#39;ye hear?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about 
      <i>
        his
      </i>
       being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;You are a coward!&#39; hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;So I am, but take that.&#39; The mate was in the very act of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt&#39;s threat, whatever that might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew. Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the ship&#39;s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt&#39;s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate&#39;s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
       “During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship&#39;s side. In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o&#39;clock, in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;What are you making there?&#39; said a shipmate.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;What do you think? what does it look like?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Like a lanyard for your bag; but it&#39;s an odd one, seems to me.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Yes, rather oddish,&#39; said the Lakeman, holding it at arm&#39;s length before him; &#39;but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven&#39;t enough twine,—have you any?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “But there was none in the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Then I must get some from old Rad;&#39; and he rose to go aft.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;You don&#39;t mean to go a begging to 
      <i>
        him!
      </i>
       &#39; said a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Why not? Do you think he won&#39;t do me a turn, when it&#39;s to help himself in the end, shipmate?&#39; and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman&#39;s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman&#39;s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, &#39;There she rolls! there she rolls!&#39; Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Moby Dick!&#39; cried Don Sebastian; &#39;St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but that would be too long a story.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;How? how?&#39; cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more into the air, Sirs.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;The chicha! the chicha!&#39; cried Don Pedro; &#39;our vigorous friend looks faint;—fill up his empty glass!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. &#39;The White Whale—the White Whale!&#39; was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate&#39;s got the start; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale&#39;s topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale&#39;s slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Meantime, at the first tap of the boat&#39;s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney&#39;s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary place—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
       “The ship&#39;s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
       “On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;What do you want of me?&#39; cried the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?&#39; demanded Steelkilt; &#39;no lies.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;I am bound to Tahiti for more men.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.&#39; With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;A pretty scholar,&#39; laughed the Lakeman. &#39;Adios, Senor!&#39; and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him. * * * *
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Are you through?&#39; said Don Sebastian, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;I am, Don.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem to press.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don Sebastian&#39;s suit,&#39; cried the company, with exceeding interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Nay,&#39; said Don Sebastian; &#39;but I know a worthy priest near by, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this may grow too serious.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,&#39; said one of the company to another; &#39;I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       * * * * * *
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,&#39; said Don Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye, gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.&#39;”
