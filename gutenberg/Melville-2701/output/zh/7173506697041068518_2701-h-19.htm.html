      第 94 章。手的挤压。
    </h2>
    <p>
       Stubb 的那条鲸鱼，如此昂贵地购买，被及时带到 Pequod 的身边，所有那些以前详述的切割和提升操作都定期进行，甚至到 Heidelburgh Tun 或 Case 的打包。
    </p>
    <p>
      有些人忙于后一项工作，而另一些人则忙于拖走刚装满精子的大桶。当适当的时间到来时，同样的精子在进入试验工作之前被仔细地操纵，其中很快。
    </p>
    <p>
      它已经冷却并结晶到如此程度，以至于当我和其他几个人坐在君士坦丁大浴缸前时，我发现它奇怪地凝结成块，在液体部分到处滚动。我们的任务是将这些块状物挤回液体中。一个甜蜜而虚伪的职责！难怪在过去这种精子是如此受欢迎的化妆品。这么清晰！这样的甜味剂！这样的软化剂！如此美味的修饰剂！将我的手放入其中仅几分钟后，我的手指感觉像鳗鱼一样，开始呈蛇形和螺旋状。
    </p>
    <p>
      当我盘腿坐在甲板上时，我很自在；在起锚机上苦苦挣扎之后；在湛蓝宁静的天空下；船在漫不经心的风帆下，平静地滑行着；当我在那些几乎在一小时内编织而成的柔软、温和的浸润组织球中沐浴时；当它们在我的手指上丰盛地绽放，释放出它们所有的丰盈，就像完全成熟的葡萄它们的酒；当我闻到那股未受污染的香气时——字面意思和真实，就像春天紫罗兰的气味；我向你声明，我那段时间生活在充满麝香的草地上；我忘记了我们可怕的誓言；在那无法形容的精液中，我用它洗了手和心；我几乎开始相信古老的 Paracelsan 迷信，即精子在减轻愤怒方面具有罕见的功效；在那个浴缸里沐浴时，我感到神圣地没有任何恶意、任性或恶意。
    </p>
    <p>
      挤！挤！挤！整个上午；我挤压那精子，直到我自己几乎融入其中；我挤压那个精子，直到一种奇怪的精神错乱涌上心头；我发现自己不自觉地把我同事的手挤进去，把他们的手误认为是温和的水珠。这种业余爱好产生了如此丰富、深情、友好、充满爱意的感觉；最后，我不断地握着他们的手，充满感情地仰望着他们的眼睛；甚至可以说——哦！我亲爱的同胞们，我们为什么要再怀有任何社会的刻薄，或知道最轻微的恶意或嫉妒！来;让我们握紧双手；不，让我们都挤在一起；让我们普遍地挤进仁慈的乳汁和精子中。
    </p>
    <p>
      但愿我能永远挤压那个精子！就目前而言，由于通过许多长期的、反复的经验，我意识到在所有情况下，人最终都必须降低或至少改变他对可获得的幸福的自负；不要把它放在理智或幻想中的任何地方；但在妻子、心、床、桌子、马鞍、炉边、国家；既然我已经察觉到这一切，我就准备永远挤压案例。在夜晚的幻象中，我看到天堂里长长的一排天使，每个人的手都拿着一罐鲸鱼。
    </p>
    <p>
      现在，在讨论精子的同时，也有必要谈谈其他类似的事情，即为抹香鲸准备试验的工作。
    </p>
    <p>
      首先是所谓的白马，它是从鱼的逐渐变细的部分获得的，也是从他的尾鳍的较厚部分获得的。凝固的肌腱（一团肌肉）很难吃，但仍然含有一些油。与鲸鱼分离后，白马先被切成便于携带的长方形，然后再送往绞肉机。它们看起来很像伯克希尔大理石块。
    </p>
    <p>
      李子布丁这个词是用来形容鲸鱼肉的某些零碎部分的，它们到处粘附在脂肪层上，而且通常在相当大的程度上参与了它的油腻。这是一个令人耳目一新，欢乐，美丽的事物。正如它的名字所暗示的那样，它具有极其丰富的斑驳色调，雪白和金色的地面上斑驳斑驳，点缀着深红色和紫色的斑点。它是红宝石的李子，在柚子的照片中。不管出于什么原因，都很难阻止自己不吃它。我承认，有一次我偷偷溜到前桅后面去试试。它的味道就像我想象的那样，从路易斯勒格罗斯的大腿上取下皇家炸肉排可能会尝到，假设他在鹿肉季节后的第一天被杀死，而那个特定的鹿肉季节恰逢葡萄园异常优质的年份香槟酒。
    </p>
    <p>
      还有另一种物质，一种非常奇异的物质，它出现在这件事的过程中，但我觉得描述它是非常令人费解的。它被称为 slobgollion；捕鲸人最初的称呼，物质的性质也是如此。这是一种难以言喻的粘稠物，最常见于精子桶中，经过长时间挤压和随后的倾析。我认为它是表壳的非常薄的破裂膜，正在聚结。
    </p>
    <p>
      所谓的 Gurry 是露脊捕鲸者的专有名词，但有时也会被精子渔民偶然使用。它指的是从格陵兰岛或露脊鲸的背部刮下的黑色粘稠物质，其中大部分覆盖了那些猎杀那只卑鄙的利维坦的低等灵魂的甲板。
    </p>
    <p>
      钳子。严格来说，这个词并不是鲸鱼的词汇。但正如捕鲸人所应用的那样，它就变成了这样。捕鲸人的钳子是从利维坦尾巴逐渐变细的部分切下的一条短而结实的带状物质：它的平均厚度为一英寸，其余部分的大小与锄头的铁部分差不多。沿着油腻的甲板边缘移动，它像皮革橡皮擦一样运作；通过无名的甜言蜜语，就像魔法一样，引诱所有的不洁。
    </p>
    <p>
      但要了解所有这些深奥的事情，你最好的办法是立即进入母乳室，与里面的囚犯进行长时间的交谈。当从鲸鱼身上脱下并吊起时，这个地方之前被提到是毯子的容器。当切割内容物的适当时间到来时，这间公寓对所有新手来说都是恐怖的场景，尤其是在晚上。一侧，在一盏昏暗的灯笼的照耀下，为工人留出了一块空地。他们通常成双成对——一个长矛加夫曼和一个黑桃人。捕鲸矛类似于护卫舰的同名登船武器。鱼叉有点像船钩。船长用鱼钩钩住一片鲸脂，努力防止它在船摇晃晃动时滑倒。同时，黑桃人站在床单上，将床单垂直切成便携式马件。这把铲子锋利无比；铲子的脚没有穿鞋；他站立的东西有时会像雪橇一样不可抗拒地从他身边滑开。如果他切断了自己或他助手之一的脚趾，您会感到非常惊讶吗？经验丰富的油房男人很少有脚趾。

    <p>
      你是否在鲸鱼尸体解剖的某个时刻登上了 Pequod？如果你在起锚机附近漫步向前，我敢肯定你会带着不小的好奇心扫视一个非常奇怪、神秘的物体，你会在那里看到它，它纵向躺在背风泄水孔中。不是鲸鱼巨大脑袋中奇妙的蓄水池；不是他错乱的下颚的神童；不是他对称尾巴的奇迹；这些都不会像瞥见那个莫名其妙的圆锥体那样让你感到惊讶，它比肯塔基人还高，底部直径接近一英尺​​，像魁魁格的乌木偶像 Yojo 一样乌黑。它确实是一个偶像；或者，更确切地说，在过去，它的相似之处是。像在犹太玛查王后的秘密树林中发现的那样的偶像；为了崇拜它，她的儿子亚撒王废了她，毁掉了偶像，并在基德龙溪边将其焚毁，作为可憎之物，正如《列王纪上》第 15 章所暗述的那样。
    </p>
    <p>
      看看那个叫 mincer 的水手，他现在走了过来，在两个盟友的协助下，沉重地背着 grandissimus，正如水手们所说的那样，弯着肩膀，摇摇晃晃地离开了，就好像他是一个手榴弹兵背着一个死去的战友从外地。将它延伸到船首甲板上，他现在以圆柱形方式继续去除它的黑色毛皮，就像非洲猎人去除蟒蛇的毛皮一样。完成后，他将毛皮翻过来，就像裤腿一样；给它一个很好的拉伸，几乎使它的直径增加一倍；最后把它挂起来，铺好，在索具上晾干。不久，它被取下；当他朝尖的一端移开大约三英尺，然后在另一端切开两个缝隙作为袖孔时，他会纵身滑入其中。绞肉机现在站在你投资于他职业的全部规范之前。对他的所有命令来说都是不朽的，仅此一项授权就足以保护他，同时受雇于他办公室的特殊职能。
    </p>
    <p>
      该办公室包括将马脂切碎用于锅中。一项操作是在一匹奇怪的木马上进行的，木马的两端靠着舷墙种植，下面有一个宽敞的浴缸，碎块落入其中，就像全神贯注的演说家办公桌上的床单一样快。排列得体的黑色；占据显眼的讲坛；意图在圣经叶子上；这个绞肉机是多么适合大主教职位的候选人，多么适合教皇的小伙子！ *
    </p>
    <p>
       *圣经离开！圣经离开！这是伙伴们对绞肉机不变的呼喊。它嘱咐他要小心，尽可能把他的工作切成薄片，因为这样做可以大大加快煮沸油的速度，而且它的数量也大大增加，此外还可能提高质量。

      第 96 章 Try-Works。
    </h2>
    <p>
      除了她的吊船外，一位美国捕鲸者还以她的尝试工作而著称。她展示了最坚固的砖石与橡木和大麻一起构成整艘船的奇异之处。就好像一个砖窑从开阔的田野被运到她的木板上。
    </p>
    <p>
      试验装置位于前桅和主桅之间，是甲板上最宽敞的部分。下面的木材具有特殊的强度，适合支撑几乎坚固的砖块和砂浆块的重量，大约十英尺乘八平方，高五英尺。地基没有穿透甲板，但砖石结构通过四面支撑的笨重铁膝牢牢固定在表面，并将其拧紧到木材上。它的侧面用木头包裹，顶部完全被一个大的、倾斜的、用板条固定的舱口盖住。卸下这个舱口，我们露出了两个大试锅，每个试锅都有几个桶的容量。不使用时，它们会保持非常干净。有时，它们会用皂石和沙子打磨，直到它们像银色酒碗一样闪闪发光。在守夜期间，一些愤世嫉俗的老水手会爬进船里，蜷缩在那里小睡片刻。在受雇擦亮它们时——每个罐子里有一个人，肩并肩——许多机密通信是通过铁唇进行的。它也是进行深刻数学冥想的地方。正是在 Pequod 的左手试锅中，滑石在我周围勤奋地盘旋，我第一次间接地被一个非凡的事实所打动，即在几何学中，所有沿着摆线滑动的物体，例如我的滑石，都会从在同一时间的任何一点。
    </p>
    <p>
      把试火炉前面的火板移开，那一侧光秃秃的砖石暴露在外，被炉子的两个铁口穿透，就在锅的正下方。这些口装有沉重的铁门。通过在工程的整个封闭表面下方延伸的浅水库，可以防止火灾的高温自行传递到甲板。通过插入后部的隧道，该水库在水蒸发的同时不断补充水。没有外部烟囱；它们直接从后墙打开。让我们回顾一下。
    </p>
    <p>
      大约在晚上九点钟，Pequod 号的试航工作在当前的航行中首次开始。它属于 Stubb 来监督业务。
    </p>
    <p>
       “都准备好了吗？关闭孵化器，然后启动她。你做饭，开火。”这是一件容易的事，因为木匠一直在把刨花塞进整个通道的炉子里。可以这样说，在一次捕鲸航行中，试炼厂的第一把火必须用木头来供养一段时间。在那之后，除了作为主要燃料的快速点火手段外，不再使用木材。总而言之，经过试用，脆皮、皱缩的脂肪，现在被称为碎屑或油条，仍然含有相当多的油腻特性。这些油条助长了火焰。就像一个燃烧过多的烈士，或者一个自我消耗的厌世者，一旦被点燃，鲸鱼就会提供自己的燃料并用自己的身体燃烧。他会抽自己的烟吗！因为他的烟很难吸入，你必须吸入它，不仅如此，而且你必须暂时生活在其中。它有一种难以形容的、野性的、印度教的气味，就像可能潜伏在葬礼柴堆附近一样。它闻起来像审判日的左翼；这是一个坑的论据。
    </p>
    <p>
      到午夜时分，工程已全面投入运营。我们远离尸体；扬帆起航；风很清新。狂野的海洋黑暗很强烈。但是那片黑暗被猛烈的火焰吞噬了，火焰不时地从乌黑的烟道中喷出，照亮了索具中的每根高高的绳索，就像著名的希腊大火一样。燃烧的船继续行驶，仿佛无情地委托进行某种报复行为。因此，大胆的 Hydriote、Canaris 的沥青和装满硫磺的双桅船从他们午夜的港口出发，用宽大的火焰帆作为帆，冲向土耳其护卫舰，并将它们折叠成大火。
    </p>
    <p>
      从工厂顶部移开的舱口现在在他们面前提供了一个宽阔的壁炉。站在上面的是异教徒标枪手的鞑靼人形象，他们总是捕鲸船的司炉。他们用巨大的叉杆将发出嘶嘶声的大量鲸脂扔进滚烫的锅里，或者搅动下面的火，直到蜿蜒的火焰从门外窜出，卷曲着抓住他们的脚。浓烟滚滚而去，闷闷不乐。船的每一个斜坡都有一个沸腾的油斜坡，似乎都急于跳到他们的脸上。在工地入口的对面，在宽阔的木壁炉的另一边，是绞盘机。这用于海沙发。守夜人闲暇时就在这里闲逛，看着火红的热度，直到他们的眼睛感到头上都被烧焦了。他们黄褐色的容貌，现在全都被烟雾和汗水弄脏了，他们乱蓬蓬的胡须，以及对比鲜明的野蛮牙齿，所有这些都在作品反复无常的装饰中奇怪地显露出来。当他们互相讲述他们邪恶的冒险经历时，他们用欢乐的语言讲述着恐怖的故事；当他们不文明的笑声从他们身上向上叉开时，就像熔炉里的火焰一样；至于来回，在他们的前面，标枪手用他们巨大的叉子和勺子疯狂地比划着。风呼啸而过，海面在跳跃，船在呻吟和俯冲，却坚定地将她的红色地狱射向大海和黑夜的黑暗深处，轻蔑地咬住她嘴里的白骨，恶毒地向她四面吐口水；然后是奔流的 Pequod，满载着野蛮人，满载着火焰，燃烧着一具尸体，陷入了黑暗中，似乎是她偏执狂指挥官灵魂的物质对应物。
    </p>
    <p>
      在我看来，当我站在她的掌舵下，并在很长一段时间内默默地为这艘海上的火船指引方向时。在那段时间里，我自己被包裹在黑暗中，但我更好地看到了其他人的红色、疯狂和可怕。不断地看到我面前的恶魔形象，一半在烟雾中，一半在火焰中跳跃，这些终于在我的灵魂中产生了类似的幻觉，当我开始屈服于午夜舵手时会笼罩我的那种无法解释的困倦时.
    </p>
    <p>
      但特别是那天晚上，我想到了一件奇怪的（而且一直无法解释的）事情。从短暂的站立睡眠开始，我就非常意识到有什么致命的错误。颚骨舵柄击中了我靠在它上面的一侧；我的耳边是风帆低沉的嗡嗡声，刚开始在风中摇晃；我以为我的眼睛是睁开的；我半意识地把手指放在眼睑上，机械地把它们拉得更远。但是，尽管如此，我还是看不到我面前的指南针可以指引方向；虽然我看着这张卡片似乎只有一分钟，但稳定的罗盘灯照亮了它。在我面前似乎什么都没有，只有一片漆黑，不时地被红色的闪光弄得可怕。最重要的印象是，无论我站在什么迅速、奔腾的东西上，与其说是束缚于前方的任何避风港，不如说是从所有避风港向后冲去。一种死一般的、迷茫的感觉向我袭来。我的手痉挛地抓住舵柄，但疯狂地自负地认为舵柄不知何故以某种迷人的方式倒置了。我的上帝！我怎么了？我想。瞧！在我短暂的睡眠中，我转过身，正对着船尾，背对着她的船头和罗盘。瞬间，我转过身来，正好赶上了，以防止船在风中飞起来，很可能会倾覆她。从夜间的这种不自然的幻觉中解脱出来，以及被背风带来的致命意外，是多么高兴和感激啊！
    </p>
    <p>
      面对火焰不要看太久，哦，伙计！永远不要梦想用你的手掌舵！不要背对着罗盘；接受舵柄的第一个暗示；不要相信人造火，当它的红色使所有事物看起来都可怕时。明天，在自然的阳光下，天空将是明亮的；那些在分叉的火焰中像恶魔一样怒目而视的人，黎明将以另一种方式显示出来，至少是温和的解脱；光荣的、金色的、快乐的太阳，唯一真正的灯——所有其他的都是骗子！
    </p>
    <p>
      尽管如此，太阳并没有掩盖弗吉尼亚阴郁的沼泽，也没有掩盖罗马被诅咒的平原，也没有掩盖广阔的撒哈拉沙漠，也没有掩盖月光下数百万英里的沙漠和悲痛。太阳遮不住海洋，海洋是地球的黑暗面，占地球的三分之二。所以，因此，那个凡人的快乐多于悲伤，那个凡人不可能是真实的——不真实，或未发展。与书籍相同。最真实的人是悲伤的人，所有书籍中最真实的是所罗门的，而传道书是痛苦的精钢。 “一切都是虚荣。”全部。这个任性的世界还没有掌握非基督徒所罗门的智慧。但他躲避医院和监狱，快步穿过墓地，宁愿谈歌剧也不愿谈地狱；把考珀、杨、帕斯卡、卢梭称为可怜的魔鬼，全都是病态的人；在无忧无虑的一生中，拉伯雷发誓说他过得聪明，因此很快乐；——不是那个人适合坐在墓碑上，用深不可测的所罗门打破绿色潮湿的霉菌。
    </p>
    <p>
      但即使是所罗门，他说，“迷失在悟性道路上的人，仍将留在”（
      <i>
        即
      </i>
      ，即使在活着的时候）“在死者的会众中”。那么，不要把自己交给火，以免它使你颠倒，使你麻木；至于它对我的影响。有一种智慧是祸患；但有一种祸患是疯狂。在一些灵魂中有一只卡茨基尔鹰，它们可以潜入最黑暗的峡谷，然后再次翱翔，在阳光明媚的空间中隐身。即使他永远在峡谷中飞行，那个峡谷在山上；因此，即使在最低限度的俯冲中，山雕仍然比平原上的其他鸟类高，尽管它们会翱翔。

    </h2>
    <p>
      如果你从 Pequod 的试验工作下降到 Pequod 的船首楼，下班值班的人正在那里睡觉，有那么一瞬间你几乎会以为你站在某个被册封的国王和顾问的灯火通明的神殿里。他们躺在三角形的橡木拱顶里，每个水手都是一个凿刻的沉默者；二十盏灯在他蒙着兜帽的眼睛上闪烁。
    </p>
    <p>
      对于商船来说，供水手使用的油比皇后的奶还稀缺。在黑暗中穿衣，在黑暗中吃饭，在黑暗中跌跌撞撞地回到他的托盘，这是他的常态。但是捕鲸人，当他寻找光的食物时，他就生活在光中。他把床铺做成阿拉丁神灯，让他躺在里面；所以在最漆黑的夜晚，船的黑色船体仍然亮着灯。
    </p>
    <p>
      看看捕鲸人是多么自由地拿着他的一把灯——通常只是旧瓶子和小瓶——到试炼厂的铜制冷却器，然后在那里补充它们，就像大桶里的啤酒杯一样。他也燃烧最纯净的油，在其未经加工的状态下，因此，未受污染的状态；一种不为陆地上的太阳、月球或星体装置所知的液体。它像四月的早草黄油一样甜。他去寻找他的油，以确保其新鲜和真实，就像草原上的旅行者寻找他自己的野味晚餐一样。

      第 98 章收起和清理。
    </h2>
    <p>
      已经有人讲述了巨兽是如何从桅顶远处被描述出来的；他是如何被追赶过多水的沼泽，又如何在深谷中被屠杀；他是如何被拖到旁边并被斩首的；以及（根据古代刽子手有权获得被斩首者被处死时穿的衣服的原则）他的大衬垫外衣如何成为刽子手的财产；他如何在适当的时候被判处火刑，并且像沙得拉、米煞和亚伯尼歌一样，他的鲸蜡、油和骨头在火中毫发无损；——但现在要结束这部分的最后一章通过排练（如果可以的话，唱歌）来描述浪漫的过程，将他的油倒入木桶中，然后将它们击打到船舱中，利维坦再次回到他的原生深处，像以前一样在水面下滑行；可惜！再也不会升起和吹响。
    </p>
    <p>
      趁着还热的时候，油就像热潘趣酒一样被装入六桶桶中；也许，当船在午夜的大海中左右摇摆时，巨大的木桶被旋转着转向，首尾相接，有时危险地滑过湿滑的甲板，就像许多陆地滑坡一样，直到最后有人操纵并留在他们的航线上；在篮圈周围，敲打，敲打，尽可能多地敲打它们，现在，
      <i>
        依职权
      </i>
      ，每个水手都是桶匠。
    </p>
    <p>
      最终，当最后一品脱酒装好后，一切都凉了，然后大舱口被打开，船的内部被打开，木桶下到海里最后安息。完成后，舱口被更换，并密封关闭，就像壁橱一样。
    </p>
    <p>
      在精子渔业中，这可能是所有捕鲸行业中最引人注目的事件之一。有一天，木板上流淌着新鲜的血和油；在神圣的后甲板上，大量的鲸鱼头被亵渎地堆放着；生锈的大桶随处可见，就像在啤酒厂的院子里一样。试验厂冒出的烟熏黑了所有的舷墙；水手们到处都是油腻腻的；整艘船似乎都是巨大的海兽；所有人的喧嚣都震耳欲聋。
    </p>
    <p>
      但是一两天后，你环顾四周，在这艘同一艘船上竖起了耳朵；如果不是那些讲故事的小船和试验品，你几乎会发誓你踏上了一艘安静的商船，船长非常一丝不苟。未经加工的鲸油具有独特的清洁功效。这就是为什么甲板看起来从来没有像他们所谓的石油事件之后那么白的原因。此外，用烧过的鲸鱼碎片的灰烬很容易制成烈性碱液。每当鲸鱼背部的任何粘附物仍然附着在侧面时，碱液就会迅速将其消灭。双手勤奋地沿着舷墙移动，用一桶水和抹布将它们恢复到完全整洁的状态。烟灰是从下部索具上刷下来的。所有使用过的众多工具也同样忠实地清洗和存放。大舱口被擦洗并放在试车上，完全隐藏了罐子；每个桶都看不见；所有的铲球都盘绕在看不见的角落里；当几乎整个船公司的联合和同步努力最终完成了这一尽职尽责的职责时，船员们自己开始洗澡；从头到脚移动自己；最后，当新郎从最精致的荷兰跳出来时，新郎们来到完美无暇的甲板上，清新而通红。
    </p>
    <p>
      现在，他们兴高采烈地三三两两地在木板上走来走去，幽默地谈论起居室、沙发、地毯和精美的细麻织物；提议垫甲板；想想挂到顶端；反对不要在船首楼广场的月光下喝茶。向这些麝香的水手暗示油、骨头和鲸脂，简直就是大胆。他们不知道你遥远地提到的事情。走开，给我们拿餐巾纸！
    </p>
    <p>
      但是请注意：在高处，在三个桅杆的顶端，站着三个人，他们正打算侦察更多的鲸鱼，如果被抓住，肯定会再次弄脏旧橡木家具，并在某处留下至少一个小油点。是的;许多时候，在最艰苦的不间断劳动之后，没有黑夜；持续九十六个小时；当他们从船上下来时，他们的手腕在绳索上划了一整天，肿胀了他们的手腕，他们只是走到甲板上携带巨大的链条，举起沉重的卷扬机，切割和削减，是的，并且在他们的汗水中被赤道太阳和赤道试验场的联合火焰重新熏制和燃烧；在这一切之后，他们终于鼓起勇气清洗了这艘船，将它打造成了一尘不染的乳品室；很多时候，这些可怜的家伙，刚刚扣好他们干净连衣裙的领子，就被“她在吹！”的叫声吓了一跳。然后他们飞去与另一头鲸鱼搏斗，并再次经历整个疲倦的事情。哦！我的朋友们，但这是杀人！然而这就是生活。因为我们凡人几乎没有通过长期的辛劳从这个世界的巨大体积中提取出它的小而有价值的精子；然后，带着疲倦的耐心，净化我们自己的污秽，学会生活在灵魂干净的帐幕中；这几乎没有完成，当
      <i>
        ——她在那里吹！

       ——鬼魂喷出，扬帆远航，去异世界打仗，重走年轻生活的老套路。
    </p>
    <p>
      哦！轮回！哦！毕达哥拉斯，2000 年前在明媚的希腊死去，那么善良，那么睿智，那么温和；上次航行时，我和你一起沿着秘鲁海岸航行——虽然我很愚蠢，但我还是教了你，一个单纯的绿色男孩，如何拼接绳索！

      此前，已经讲述了亚哈如何习惯于在他的尾甲板上走动，在罗经柜和主桅的任一极限处定期转弯；但在许多其他需要叙述的事情中，却没有补充说，有时在这些散步中，当他心情最激动时，他习惯于在每个地方轮流停下来，站在那里奇怪地注视着他面前的特定物体。当他停在罗盘前，目光紧紧盯着罗盘上的尖针时，那一瞥像标枪一样射出，带着他目的的尖锐强度；当他继续往前走时，他又在主桅前停了下来，然后，当他那同样的目光注视着那里那枚铆钉的金币时，他仍然带着同样坚定的外表，只是被某种狂热的渴望冲昏了头脑，如果不是充满希望的话。
    </p>
    <p>
      但一天早上，他转过身去递达布隆币，他似乎又被上面刻着的奇怪数字和铭文所吸引，仿佛现在这是第一次开始以某种偏执狂的方式为自己解释其中可能潜藏的意义。所有事物都潜伏着某些特定的意义，否则所有事物都没有什么价值，而圆形世界本身只是一个空密码，除了用车子出售，就像他们在波士顿周围的山上一样，以填补银河系中的一些沼泽。
    </p>
    <p>
      现在这个达布隆是最纯净的纯金，从美丽的山丘中心的某个地方挖出来的，从那里，东方和西方，在金色的沙滩上，许多 Pactolus 流的源头。尽管现在被钉在生锈的铁螺栓和铜色的铜钉中，然而，它不受任何污秽的影响，完美无暇，它仍然保持着基多的光芒。也不是，虽然被安置在冷酷无情的船员中间，每个小时都被冷酷无情的人流过，并在漫长的夜晚笼罩在浓密的黑暗中，可能掩盖任何偷窃的方法，但每次日出都会找到日落最后留下的双布隆。因为它被分别为圣，达到一个令人敬畏的目的；无论他们的水手方式多么肆意，水手们都将它尊为白鲸的护身符。有时他们在夜里疲倦地值班时讨论这件事，想知道最后是谁的，他是否能活着花掉它。

      现在，那些南美高贵的金币就像是太阳的勋章和热带的信物。这里有棕榈树、羊驼和火山；太阳的圆盘和星星；黄道、富贵之角、富贵旌旗飘扬，都盖上了繁茂的印记；因此，通过那些富有西班牙诗意的精美铸币厂，珍贵的黄金似乎几乎获得了额外的珍贵和荣耀。
    </p>
    <p>
       Pequod 的达布隆恰好是这些东西中最富有的例子。它的圆形边框上刻有字母：REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR：QUITO。因此，这枚闪亮的硬币来自一个种植在世界中部、大赤道以下的国家，并以此命名；它是在安第斯山脉中段，在没有秋天的持续气候中被抛下的。按照这些字母的划分，你看到了安第斯山脉三座山峰的相似之处；从一个火焰；一座塔楼；第三个是公鸡啼叫；拱形覆盖着所有部分的是分区黄道带的一部分，所有星座都标有它们通常的秘法，拱心石太阳进入天秤座的春分点。

       Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
       “There&#39;s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician&#39;s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, &#39;tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here&#39;s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil&#39;s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to himself, leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read Belshazzar&#39;s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “There now&#39;s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he&#39;s been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer&#39;s Hook, I&#39;d not look at it very long ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here&#39;s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I&#39;ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll&#39;s arithmetic, I&#39;ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here&#39;s the book. Let&#39;s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he&#39;s always among &#39;em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are—here they go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here&#39;s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among &#39;em. Aye, here on the coin he&#39;s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You&#39;ll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That&#39;s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch&#39;s navigator, and Daboll&#39;s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There&#39;s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I&#39;ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin: there&#39;s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that&#39;s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here&#39;s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep. There&#39;s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly&#39;s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let&#39;s hear what he&#39;ll have to say. There; he&#39;s before it; he&#39;ll out with something presently. So, so; he&#39;s beginning.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what&#39;s all this staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that&#39;s true; and at two cents the cigar, that&#39;s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won&#39;t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here&#39;s nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy &#39;em out.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side of the mast; why, there&#39;s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he&#39;s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he&#39;s muttering—voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the sun stands in some one of these signs. I&#39;ve studied signs, and know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what&#39;s the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign—the roaring and devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “There&#39;s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg—all tattooing—looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the Cannibal? As I live he&#39;s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone; thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon&#39;s Astronomy in the back country. And by Jove, he&#39;s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh—I guess it&#39;s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don&#39;t know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king&#39;s trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he say, with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin—fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip—poor boy! would he had died, or I; he&#39;s half horrible to me. He too has been watching all of these interpreters—myself included—and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot face. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Upon my soul, he&#39;s been studying Murray&#39;s Grammar! Improving his mind, poor fellow! But what&#39;s that he says now—hist!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, he&#39;s getting it by heart—hist! again.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, that&#39;s funny.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I&#39;m a crow, especially when I stand a&#39;top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw! caw! caw! caw! caw! Ain&#39;t I a crow? And where&#39;s the scare-crow? There he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could go hang myself. Any way, for the present, I&#39;ll quit Pip&#39;s vicinity. I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he&#39;s too crazy-witty for my sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Here&#39;s the ship&#39;s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what&#39;s the consequence? Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught&#39;s nailed to the mast it&#39;s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he&#39;ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old darkey&#39;s wedding ring. How did it get there? And so they&#39;ll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser&#39;ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes &#39;mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!”

       CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.
    </h2>
    <h3 id="pgepubid00106">
       The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
    </h3>
    <p>
       “Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat&#39;s bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar&#39;s surcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hast seen the White Whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like a mallet.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near him—“Stand by to lower!”
    </p>
    <p>
       In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment&#39;s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen—to clamber up a ship&#39;s side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.
    </p>
    <p>
       It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.”
    </p>
    <p>
       As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can shrink, d&#39;ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did&#39;st thou see the White Whale?—how long ago?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from the capstan, and resting on the Englishman&#39;s shoulder, as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,” began the Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling round so, that my boat&#39;s crew could only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows&#39; feet and wrinkles.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended breath.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye—they were mine— 
      <i>
        my
      </i>
       irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow; but we didn&#39;t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale&#39;s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat&#39;s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate&#39;s boat—Mr. Mounttop&#39;s here (by the way, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop&#39;s boat, which, d&#39;ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes out—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale&#39;s tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell&#39;s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my arm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship&#39;s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains. But, at his superior&#39;s introduction of him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain&#39;s bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was a shocking bad wound,” began the whale-surgeon; “and, taking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed captain, addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering his voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn&#39;t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about three o&#39;clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don&#39;t ye? You know you&#39;re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I&#39;d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it&#39;s a sort of fits to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with the arm story.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing, sir, before Captain Boomer&#39;s facetious interruption, that spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule”—pointing at it with the marlingspike—“that is the captain&#39;s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one&#39;s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a wound—“Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here; he knows.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, I don&#39;t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.
    </p>

       “Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we didn&#39;t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn&#39;t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick—as some call him—and then I knew it was he.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Did&#39;st thou cross his wake again?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Twice.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But could not fasten?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Didn&#39;t want to try to: ain&#39;t one limb enough? What should I do without this other arm? And I&#39;m thinking Moby Dick doesn&#39;t bite so much as he swallows.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to get the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man&#39;s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the White Whale&#39;s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d&#39;ye see. No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that&#39;s all.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he&#39;s welcome to the arm he has, since I can&#39;t help it, and didn&#39;t know him then; but not to another one. No more White Whales for me; I&#39;ve lowered for him once, and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye, he&#39;s best let alone; don&#39;t you think so, Captain?”—glancing at the ivory leg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He&#39;s all a magnet! How long since thou saw&#39;st him last? Which way heading?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend&#39;s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man&#39;s blood—bring the thermometer!—it&#39;s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab&#39;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the boat! Which way heading?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put. “What&#39;s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain crazy?” whispering Fedallah.
    </p>
    <p>
       But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take the boat&#39;s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards him, commanded the ship&#39;s sailors to stand by to lower.
    </p>
    <p>
       In a moment he was standing in the boat&#39;s stern, and the Manilla men were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.
