      第 10 章知心朋友。
    </h2>
    <p>
      从礼拜堂回到 Spouter-Inn，我发现魁魁格一个人在那里。他在祝福之前离开了礼拜堂。他坐在炉火前的长凳上，双脚放在炉膛上，一只手紧紧地捧着他的那个黑人小偶像。他凝视着它的脸，用折叠刀轻轻地削掉它的鼻子，同时用异教徒的方式自言自语。
    </p>
    <p>
      但是现在被打断了，他竖起了图像；很快，他走到桌边，拿起一本大书，放在膝上，开始有规律地数着页数。在每五十页——正如我想象的那样——停顿片刻，茫然地环顾四周，然后发出一声长长的、咯咯作响的口哨声，表示惊讶。然后他会在接下来的五十分钟重新开始；似乎每次都从第一页开始，就好像他数不过五十，只有把这么多五十个放在一起，他才对这么多页数感到惊讶。
    </p>
    <p>
      我饶有兴趣地坐在那里看着他。尽管他很野蛮，而且脸上伤痕累累——至少对我来说是这样——但他的脸上却有一种绝不令人讨厌的东西。你无法隐藏灵魂。透过他所有超凡脱俗的纹身，我以为我看到了一颗朴实诚实的心的痕迹；在他那双深邃的大眼睛里，黑黑的、大胆的，似乎有一种敢于挑战千鬼的精神。除此之外，这个异教徒还有一种崇高的气质，即使是他的粗鲁也不能完全破坏这种气质。他看起来像一个从不畏缩，也从未有过债主的人。是不是他的头发也被剃光了，他的前额被拉得更自由、更明亮，看起来比没有其他情况时更宽阔，这个我不敢断定；但可以肯定的是，他的脑袋在颅相学上是一个极好的脑袋。这可能看起来很荒谬，但它让我想起了华盛顿将军的头像，就像在他流行的半身像中看到的那样。它有同样长的规则坡度从眉毛上方后退的斜坡，同样非常突出，就像顶部茂密的两个长长的海角。 Queequeg 是 George Washington 同类相食开发的。
    </p>
    <p>
      当我如此仔细地打量他的时候，同时半假装在窗外看着窗外的暴风雨，他从来没有注意到我的存在，也从来没有为自己多看一眼。但似乎全神贯注于数着这本奇妙的书的页数。考虑到我们昨晚睡得多么融洽，尤其是考虑到早上醒来时我发现那深情的手臂搭在我身上，我觉得他的这种冷漠很奇怪。但是野蛮人是奇怪的生物；有时您不知道如何服用它们。起初他们很害怕；他们冷静的自我收集的简单性似乎是苏格拉底式的智慧。我还注意到魁魁格根本不和客栈里的其他海员交往，或者很少交往。他没有取得任何进展；似乎不想扩大他的熟人圈子。所有这一切都让我觉得非常奇特；然而，转念一想，其中有某种近乎崇高的东西。这是一个离家约两万英里的人，取道合恩角——这是他能到达那里的唯一途径——被扔在对他来说陌生的人群中，就好像他在木星上一样。然而他似乎完全自在。保持最大的宁静；满足于自己的陪伴；永远等于自己。这当然是一种很好的哲学。尽管毫无疑问，他从未听说过有这样的事情。但是，也许，要成为真正的哲学家，我们凡人不应该意识到如此生活或如此奋斗。一旦我听说某某男人将自己献身于哲学家，我就得出结论，就像那个消化不良的老妇人一样，他一定是“打破了他的消化器”。
    </p>
    <p>
      当我坐在那个现在寂寞的房间里时；火焰燃烧得很低，在那个温和的阶段，当它的第一个强度使空气变暖之后，它只会发光以供观看。傍晚的阴影和幽灵聚集在窗户周围，凝视着我们沉默、孤独的双胞胎；暴风雨在庄严的波浪中轰鸣；我开始意识到奇怪的感觉。我感到自己在融化。我破碎的心和疯狂的手不再转向这个狼性的世界。这个令人宽慰的野蛮人已经救赎了它。他坐在那里，他的冷漠表达了一种天性，其中没有潜伏着文明的虚伪和乏味的欺骗。他很狂野；非常值得一看的景点；然而我开始感到自己被他神秘地吸引住了。那些会排斥大多数人的东西，它们正是吸引我的磁铁。我想试试一个异教徒朋友，因为基督徒的仁慈已被证明只是空洞的礼貌。我把长凳拉到他身边，做了一些友好的手势和暗示，同时尽我最大的努力与他交谈。起初他几乎没有注意到这些进步。但不久，在我提到他昨晚的热情款待时，他假装问我是否要再次同床共枕。我告诉他是的；我觉得他看起来很高兴，也许有点受到称赞。
    </p>
    <p>
      然后我们一起把书翻过来，我努力向他解释印刷的目的，以及里面几幅图的含义。因此，我很快引起了他的兴趣；从那以后，我们开始喋喋不休地谈论这个著名小镇的各种外部景点。很快我就提出了一种社交烟雾；然后，拿出他的小袋和战斧，他悄悄地给我吸了一口烟。然后我们坐在一起，交换着他那支狂野的烟斗的气息，并让它有规律地在我们之间流过。
    </p>
    <p>
      如果异教徒的胸中还潜藏着对我漠不关心的坚冰，那么我们所拥有的这种令人愉快、和蔼可亲的烟雾很快就会将其融化，只剩下我们这些亲信。他似乎像我对他一样自然而然地喜欢上了我。烟熏完后，他把额头抵在我的额头上，搂着我的腰，说从今往后我们就结婚了。用他的国家的话说，这意味着我们是知心朋友；如果需要的话，他会很乐意为我而死。对于一个乡下人来说，这种突如其来的友谊之火似乎还为时过早，是一件非常不值得信任的事情；但是在这个简单的野蛮人中，那些旧规则将不适用。
    </p>
    <p>
      晚饭后，又一次社交聊天和抽烟，我们一起去了我们的房间。他把经过防腐处理的头颅送给我作为礼物；掏出他那巨大的烟袋，在烟袋底下摸索着，取出了三十多块钱的银子。然后把它们摊在桌子上，机械地分成两等份，把其中一份推到我面前，说这是我的。我正要抗议；但他把它们倒进我裤子的口袋里，让我闭嘴了。我让他们留下来。然后他开始做晚祷，取出他的神像，取下纸质壁炉板。根据某些迹象和症状，我认为他似乎急于让我加入他的行列；但我很清楚接下来会发生什么，我考虑了一会儿，万一他邀请我，我是否会答应。
    </p>
    <p>
      我是一个好基督徒；在万无一失的长老会教会的怀抱中出生和长大。那么我怎么能和这个疯狂的偶像崇拜者一起崇拜他的木头呢？但什么是敬拜？我想。伊斯梅尔，你现在认为宽宏大量的天地之神——异教徒和所有人——可能会嫉妒一小块黑木头吗？不可能的！但什么是敬拜？——遵行神的旨意
      <i>
        ——这
      </i>
      就是敬拜。上帝的旨意是什么？——对我的同胞做我希望我的同胞对我做的事——
      <i>
        这
      </i>
      就是上帝的旨意。现在，Queequeg 是我的同胞。我希望这个魁魁格对我做什么？为什么，在我特殊的长老会崇拜形式中与我联合。因此，我必须在他的身上与他结合；因此，我必须变成偶像崇拜者。所以我点燃了刨花；扶起天真的小偶像；给他烧焦的魁魁格饼干；在他面前受过两次或三次；亲吻他的鼻子；完成后，我们脱掉衣服上床睡觉，与我们自己的良心和整个世界和平相处。但是我们没有聊几句就睡不着了。
    </p>
    <p>
      我不知道是怎么回事；但是没有比床更适合朋友之间泄露秘密的地方了。男人和妻子，他们说，在那里彼此敞开心扉；一些老夫妻常常躺着聊到天亮。于是，在我们的心蜜月中，我和魁魁格躺下了——一对温馨、恩爱的夫妻。

      第 11 章睡衣。
    </h2>
    <p>
      我们就这样躺在床上，时不时地聊天和打瞌睡，魁魁格时不时亲切地把他那棕色纹身的腿放在我的腿上，然后又缩回去；我们是那么善于交际，那么自由自在；终于，由于我们的交谈，我们身上残留的一点点打瞌睡都消失了，我们想再次起床，尽管天亮还有一段路要走。
    </p>
    <p>
      是的，我们变得非常清醒；如此之多，以至于我们的卧姿开始变得令人厌倦，我们发现自己一点一点地坐了起来。衣服很好地裹在我们身上，靠在床头板上，四个膝盖并拢，两个鼻子弯在膝盖上，就好像我们的护膝是暖锅一样。我们感觉非常舒适和舒适，尤其是因为外面很冷；确实也没有被褥，因为房间里没有火。更重要的是，我说，因为要真正享受身体的温暖，你的一小部分必须是冷的，因为这个世界上没有任何品质不是它只是对比之下的样子。没有任何事物本身存在。如果你自以为浑身舒服，而且这么久了，那你就不能说舒服了。但是，如果像躺在床上的魁魁格和我一样，你的鼻尖或头顶微微发凉，那么为什么在一般意识中你确实会感到最愉快和明确无误的温暖。出于这个原因，睡觉的公寓永远不应该配备壁炉，这是富人的奢侈不适之一。因为这种美味的最高境界就是在你和你的舒适和外面的寒冷空气之间只有毯子。然后你躺在那里，就像北极水晶中心的一个温暖的火花。
    </p>
    <p>
      我们以这种蹲伏的方式坐了一段时间，突然间我想我会睁开眼睛；因为在睡觉时，无论是白天还是晚上，无论是睡着还是醒着，我都有办法始终闭上眼睛，以便更加专注于躺在床上的舒适感。因为除非闭上眼睛，否则任何人都无法正确地感受自己的身份；好像黑暗确实是我们本质的适当元素，尽管光明更适合我们的粘土部分。那时，当我睁开眼睛，从我自己愉快和自创的黑暗中走出来，进入半夜 12 点未开灯的强加而粗糙的黑暗时，我感到一种令人不快的反感。我也一点也不反对魁魁格的暗示，也许最好点一盏灯，因为我们是如此清醒；此外，他非常想用他的战斧安静地吸几口。可以这么说，尽管前一天晚上我对他在床上抽烟感到如此强烈的反感，但看看当爱情一旦使它们弯曲时，我们僵硬的偏见就会变得多么有弹性。现在我最喜欢魁魁格在我身边抽烟，甚至是在床上，因为那时他似乎充满了家庭的欢乐。我不再对房东的保险单感到过分担心。我只记得与一位真正的朋友共用一根烟斗和一条毯子时那种浓缩的、保密的舒适感。我们把毛茸茸的夹克披在肩上，把战斧从一个人递给另一个人，直到慢慢地在我们上方升起了蓝色的烟雾测试器，被新点亮的灯的火焰照亮。
    </p>
    <p>
      我不知道是不是这个起伏的测试者把野蛮人推到了遥远的地方，但他现在谈到了他的家乡岛屿；我很想听听他的经历，就求他继续讲下去。他欣然应允。虽然当时我还不太理解他的不少话，但后来的披露，当我对他破烂的措辞更加熟悉时，现在让我能够呈现整个故事，就像我给出的仅仅是框架所证明的那样。

      第 12 章传记。
    </h2>
    <p>
       Queequeg 是 Rokovoko 的本地人，这是一个远离西部和南部的岛屿。它不在任何地图上；真正的地方永远不会。
    </p>
    <p>
      当一个刚孵化出来的野蛮人披着草丛在他的家乡林地里狂奔，后面跟着啃食的山羊，就好像他是一棵绿色的树苗；即使在那个时候，在魁魁格雄心勃勃的灵魂中，也潜伏着一种强烈的愿望，希望看到更多基督教世界的东西，而不是一两个标本捕鲸船。他的父亲是一位大酋长，一位国王；他的叔叔是一位大祭司；在母性方面，他吹嘘阿姨是不可战胜的战士的妻子。他的血管里流淌着极好的血液——皇室的血统；尽管我担心他在未受教育的青年时期养成的食人癖好，可悲地败坏了。
    </p>
    <p>
      萨格港的一艘船造访了他父亲的海湾，魁魁格寻找通往基督教领地的通道。但是这艘拥有全部海员的船拒绝了他的诉求。并非他父亲国王的所有影响都能占上风。但是魁魁格发誓。他独自划着独木舟划向远处的海峡，他知道这艘船离开该岛时必经该海峡。一侧是珊瑚礁；另一边是一片低矮的地舌，上面长满了伸入水中的红树林。他把他的独木舟藏起来，仍然漂浮在这些灌木丛中，船头朝向大海，他坐在船尾，手里低着桨；当船滑过时，他像闪电一样冲了出去。赢得了她的支持；他的脚向后一蹬，独木舟就倾覆沉没了。爬上铁链；他直挺挺地扑倒在甲板上，抓住那里的一个环形螺栓，发誓即使被砍成碎片也不松手。
    </p>
    <p>
      船长扬言要把他扔下海，但没有用。把弯刀挂在他裸露的手腕上；魁魁格是一位国王的儿子，而魁魁格没有让步。船长被他绝望的无畏精神和拜访基督教世界的疯狂愿望所打动，最终心软了，并告诉他他可以回家了。但是这个漂亮的年轻野蛮人——这个海上威尔士亲王，从未见过船长的小屋。他们把他放在水手中间，让他成为捕鲸人。但是，就像沙皇彼得满足于在外国城市的造船厂里辛勤劳作一样，魁魁格并不蔑视表面上的耻辱，如果这样他可能会很高兴地获得启发他未受教育的同胞的力量的话。因为在本质上——他告诉我——他是被一种强烈的渴望所驱使，想在基督徒中间学习使他的人民比他们现在更幸福的艺术；不仅如此，仍然比他们更好。可惜！捕鲸人的做法很快使他相信，即使是基督徒也可能既悲惨又邪恶。远比他父亲所有的异教徒都多。终于抵达老萨格港；看看水手在那里做什么；然后继续前往楠塔基特，看到他们也在
      <i>
        那个
      </i>
      地方花掉了他们的工资，可怜的魁魁格放弃了。他想，这是一个所有经脉的邪恶世界；我会死一个异教徒。
    </p>
    <p>
      因此，他内心深处是一个古老的偶像崇拜者，但他仍然生活在这些基督徒中间，穿着他们的衣服，并试图谈论他们的胡言乱语。因此，尽管现在离家有一段时间了，但他的行为方式却很古怪。
    </p>
    <p>
      借着暗示，我问他是否不打算回去举行加冕典礼；因为他现在可能认为他的父亲已经死了，在最后的账目中他已经非常老弱了。他回答没有，还没有；并补充说，他害怕基督教，或者更确切地说是基督徒，使他不适合登上他之前三十位异教国王的纯洁无瑕的宝座。但他说，他会慢慢回来——只要他觉得自己再次受洗了。然而，暂时，他提议四处航行，并在四大洋中播种他的野燕麦。他们为他制作了一把标枪，现在带刺的铁器代替了权杖。
    </p>
    <p>
      我问他他的直接目的是什么，并谈到他未来的行动。他回答说，要再次出海，继续他的老本行。对此，我告诉他捕鲸是我自己的计划，并告诉他我打算从楠塔基特驶出，因为这是一个最有希望冒险的捕鲸者出发的港口。他当即下定决心，要陪我去那个小岛，与我同船同班，同舟共济，共我一帆风顺；我双手握着他的双手，大胆地沉浸在两个世界的聚餐中。对于这一切，我欣然同意；因为除了我现在对魁魁格的感情之外，他还是一位经验丰富的标枪手，因此，对于像我一样完全不知道捕鲸的奥秘，但对商船海员所熟知的大海。
    </p>
    <p>
      他的故事以他的烟斗最后一口快要熄灭的烟头结束了，魁魁格拥抱了我，把他的额头贴在我的额头上，然后吹灭了灯，我们从彼此身边滚过，这样那样，很快就睡着了。

      第 13 章独轮车。
    </h2>
    <p>
      第二天早上，也就是星期一，我把经过防腐处理的人头交给理发师，花了一个街区，然后结清了我自己和同志的账单；然而，用我同志的钱。咧着嘴笑的房东和寄宿生似乎对我和魁魁格之间突然建立起来的友谊感到惊讶——尤其是彼得科芬关于他的公鸡和公牛的故事以前让我非常担心我现在陪伴的人和。
    </p>
    <p>
      我们借了一辆手推车，搬上了我们的东西，包括我自己那只可怜的地毯袋、魁魁格的帆布袋和吊床，然后我们去了“苔藓号”，这是停泊在码头的楠塔基特小帆船。当我们走的时候，人们盯着看；不是在魁魁格——因为他们习惯于在街上看到像他这样的食人者——而是在如此机密的条件下看到他和我。但我们没有理会他们，轮流推着手推车走着，魁魁格不时停下来调整鱼叉倒钩上的护套。我问他为什么带着这么麻烦的东西上岸，是不是所有的捕鲸船都没有找到自己的鱼叉。对此，他实质上回答说，虽然我的暗示是正确的，但他对他自己的鱼叉有一种特殊的喜爱，因为它是可靠的材料，在许多殊死的战斗中都经过了良好的考验，并且与心灵非常亲密鲸鱼。简而言之，就像许多内陆收割者和割草者一样，他们带着自己的镰刀进入农民的草地——尽管在任何情况下都没有义务提供它们——尽管如此，魁魁格出于他自己的私人原因，更喜欢他自己的鱼叉。
    </p>
    <p>
      把手推车从我手里换到他手里，他给我讲了一个关于他见过的第一辆手推车的有趣故事。那是在萨格港。他的船主似乎借给了他一个，用来将他沉重的箱子抬到他的寄宿处。不要表现出对这件事一无所知——尽管事实上他完全无知，关于管理手推车的精确方法——魁魁格挺胸前。快速鞭打它；然后扛起手推车，向码头走去。 “为什么，”我说，“Queequeg，你可能比这更清楚，有人会想。人们没有笑吗？
    </p>
    <p>
      说到这里，他又给我讲了另一个故事。他的 Rokovoko 岛上的人们似乎在他们的婚宴上将年轻椰子的芬芳水倒入一个像潘趣酒碗一样的大染色葫芦中；这个潘趣酒碗总是成为举行盛宴的编织垫上的中心装饰品。现在有一艘大商船曾经停靠在罗科沃科，它的指挥官——从各方面来看，是一位非常庄严、一丝不苟的绅士，至少对于一位船长来说——这位指挥官被邀请参加魁魁格姐姐的婚宴，一位年轻漂亮的公主刚刚转身经常。出色地;当所有参加婚礼的宾客都聚集在新娘的竹屋时，这位上尉走进来，被指派为荣誉职位，他站在酒碗旁，站在大祭司和魁魁格的父亲国王陛下之间。说到恩典——因为那些人​​和我们一样有恩典——尽管魁魁格告诉我，与我们不同，我们有时会低头看我们的盘子，相反，他们模仿鸭子，向上看伟大的赐予者在所有的宴会中——恩典，我说，据说，大祭司通过岛上远古的仪式开始宴会；也就是说，在加持的饮料流通之前，将他开光和开光的手指浸入碗中。看到自己被安排在牧师旁边，注意到仪式，并认为自己——作为一艘船的船长——显然比一个岛国国王有更高的地位，尤其是在国王自己的房子里——船长冷静地开始在潘趣酒碗里洗手;-我想把它当作一个巨大的手指玻璃。 “现在，”魁魁格说，“你现在在想什么？我们的人没有笑吗？”
    </p>
    <p>
      最后，付了船费，行李也安全了，我们站在了纵帆船上。升起风帆，顺着阿库什尼特河顺流而下。一方面，新贝德福德在街道的梯田中拔地而起，冰雪覆盖的树木在清澈寒冷的空气中闪闪发光。巨大的山丘和桶上的桶堆积在她的码头上，环游世界的捕鲸船并排静静地躺着，最后安全停泊；而从其他地方传来木匠和桶匠的声音，混合着火和熔化沥青的锻造声，所有这些都预示着新的巡航开始了；那一次最危险和最漫长的航行结束了，只开始了一秒钟；第二个结束，第三个才开始，依此类推，永远永远。这就是无尽的，是的，所有尘世的努力都是无法忍受的。
    </p>
    <p>
      获得更开阔的水域，令人振奋的微风变得清新；小苔藓从她的船头上吐出快速的泡沫，就像一匹年轻的小马驹打喷嚏一样。我是如何扼杀了鞑靼人的空气！——我是如何摒弃了收费公路的土地！——那条普通的公路到处都是奴隶脚跟和蹄子的痕迹；并使我赞叹大海的宽容，它不允许任何记录。
    </p>
    <p>
      在同一个泡沫喷泉旁，魁魁格似乎和我一起喝醉了。他深色的鼻孔鼓胀开来；他露出锉平的尖牙。继续，继续我们飞翔；我们获得了胜利，苔藓向狂风致敬；在苏丹面前像奴隶一样低头俯冲。侧身，我们侧身飞奔；每根绳索都像电线一样刺痛；两根高大的桅杆像陆地龙卷风中的印度手杖一样弯曲。当我们站在俯冲的船首斜桅旁时，充满了这种摇摇欲坠的景象，以至于有一段时间我们没有注意到乘客们嘲笑的目光，一群笨蛋，他们惊叹两个同胞如此友好；好像白人比粉饰的黑人更有尊严。但是那里有一些鲣鸟和乡巴佬，从它们浓郁的绿色来看，它们一定来自所有绿色植物的中心和中心。魁魁格抓到其中一棵小树苗在背后模仿他。我以为乡巴佬的末日到了。粗壮的野人扔下鱼叉，把他抱在怀里，以一种近乎奇迹般的灵巧和力量，把他整个人高高地抛到空中。然后在萨默塞特郡中部轻轻拍打他的船尾，那家伙着陆时脚上的肺部爆裂，而魁魁格转过身背对着他，点燃他的战斧烟斗，递给我吸了一口。
    </p>
    <p>
       “封印！上尉！乡巴佬喊道，朝那个军官跑去； “队长，队长，魔鬼来了。”
    </p>
    <p>
       “
      <i>
        你好
      </i>
      ，先生，”船长大声说，他是大海中的一根瘦骨嶙峋的肋骨，大步走向魁魁格，“你这话到底是什么意思？你不知道你可能杀了那个家伙吗？
    </p>
    <p>
       “他怎么说？”魁魁格说，他温和地转向我。
    </p>
    <p>
       “他说，”我说，“你差点杀了那里的那个人，”指着还在颤抖的新手。
    </p>
    <p>
       “Kill-e，”Queequeg 喊道，把他那张纹身的脸扭曲成一种超凡脱俗的蔑视表情，“啊！他喜欢小鱼-e； Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e;魁魁格杀死大鲸鱼！”
    </p>
    <p>
       “看你，”船长吼道，“我会杀了
      <i>
        你
      </i>
      ，你这个食人族，如果你在船上再耍花样；所以注意你的眼睛。
    </p>
    <p>
      但就在这时，船长该注意自己的眼睛了。主帆上的巨大压力撕裂了挡风雨布，巨大的隆隆声现在从一边飞到另一边，完全扫过甲板的整个后部。魁魁格粗暴对待的那个可怜的家伙，被冲下了海。所有人都惊慌失措；并试图抓住繁荣以保持它，似乎是疯狂的。它从右飞到左，然后又飞回来，几乎在手表的滴答声中，每一瞬间似乎都快要碎成碎片了。什么都没做，似乎什么也做不了；甲板上的人冲向船头，站在那里注视着吊杆，仿佛它是一头愤怒的鲸鱼的下颚。在这种惊恐之中，魁魁格灵巧地跪​​下，爬到吊杆的路径下，用鞭子抓住一根绳子，将一端固定在舷墙上，然后像套索一样抛出另一端，抓住它绕过吊杆当它掠过他的头顶时，在下一次猛拉时，翼梁就那样被困住了，一切都安全了。纵帆船迎风而行，当双手清理船尾时，Queequeg 赤裸上身，以一个长长的活生生的弧线从船舷跃起。在三分钟或更长时间里，人们看到他像条狗一样游来游去，长长的双臂在身前伸直，时而在结冰的泡沫中露出强壮的肩膀。我看着这个伟大而光荣的家伙，却没有看到任何人可以得救。新手已经倒下了。 Queequeg 从水中垂直射出自己，现在迅速环顾四周，似乎看到了事情的真相，潜入水中消失了。又过了几分钟，他又站了起来，一只手臂还在挥舞着，另一只手拖着一个没有生命的人影。船很快就把他们接走了。可怜的乡巴佬恢复了。所有人都把魁魁格选为高贵的王牌；船长请求他的原谅。从那一刻起，我像藤壶一样爱上魁魁格；是的，直到可怜的魁魁格完成了他最后一次长距离潜水。
    </p>
    <p>
      有过这样的无意识吗？他似乎认为自己根本不应该获得人道和宽宏协会颁发的奖章。他只要水——淡水——用来擦掉盐水的东西。说完，他换上干爽的衣服，点上烟斗，靠在舷墙上，淡淡地打量着周围的人，似乎在自言自语：“这是一个相互的、共同的世界，在所有的经脉中。”我们食人者必须帮助这些基督徒。”

      第 14 章楠塔基特。

    <p>
      在这段值得一提的通道上没有发生更多的事情；因此，在顺利运行之后，我们安全地抵达了楠塔基特。
    </p>
    <p>
      楠塔基特！拿出你的地图看看。看看它占据了世界上多么真实的一角；它如何矗立在那里，远离海岸，比埃迪斯通灯塔更孤独。看看它——一个小山丘和一肘沙子；全是海滩，没有背景。那里的沙子比你 20 年内用来代替吸水纸的沙子还多。一些游戏狂人会告诉你，他们必须在那里种植杂草，它们不会自然生长；他们进口加拿大蓟；他们必须派人到海外去取一根木桩来堵住油桶的泄漏；楠塔基特的木头就像罗马真正的十字架碎片一样被随身携带；那里的人们在他们的房子前种毒菌，以在夏天遮荫；一叶草成绿洲，一日三叶草成草原；他们穿流沙鞋，有点像拉普兰雪地鞋；他们是如此封闭，被束缚着，四处封闭，被包围，完全被海洋包围着，以至于有时会发现小蛤蜊粘在他们的椅子和桌子上，就像海龟的背上一样。但这些盛会仅表明楠塔基特不是伊利诺伊州。

      现在看看关于红人如何定居这个岛屿的奇妙传统故事。传说就是这样。从前，一只老鹰俯冲在新英格兰海岸，用爪子抓走了一个印第安婴儿。父母看到他们的孩子在宽阔的水面上消失了，他们大声悲叹。他们决心朝着同一个方向前进。他们乘独木舟出发，经过一段危险的航程，发现了这个岛，在那里他们发现了一个空的象牙棺材——可怜的小印第安人的骨架。

      难怪这些出生在海滩上的楠塔基特人会出海谋生！他们先是在沙滩上捉螃蟹和美洲豹；胆子大了，他们结网涉水捕鲭鱼。更有经验的他们乘船出海捕获鳕鱼。最后，在海上派出一支由大船组成的海军，探索这个水上世界；绕着它不停地进行环球航行；窥视贝林海峡；在所有的季节和所有的海洋中，与在洪水中幸存下来的最强大的有活力的群众宣告了永恒的战争；最可怕和最多山！喜马拉雅山盐海乳齿象身上披着如此不祥的无意识力量，他的恐慌比他最无畏和最恶意的攻击更可怕！
    </p>
    <p>
      就这样，这些赤身裸体的楠塔基特人，这些海洋隐士，从他们在海中的蚁丘中出来，像许多亚历山大一样，横扫并征服了水上世界；瓜分大西洋、太平洋和印度洋，就像三个海盗势力瓜分波兰一样。让美国把墨西哥和得克萨斯并在一起，把古巴和加拿大并在一起；让英国人席卷整个印度，在阳光下悬挂他们炽热的旗帜；这个水陆大陆的三分之二是楠塔基特人的。因为大海是他的；他拥有它，就像皇帝拥有帝国一样；其他海员只能通过它。商船不过是架桥；武装的但漂浮的堡垒；甚至海盗和私掠者，虽然像拦路强盗一样沿着大海走，他们也只是掠夺其他船只，像他们一样掠夺陆地的其他碎片，而不是寻求从无底深渊本身谋生。楠塔基特人，他独自在海上居住和骚动；用圣经的话来说，他独自一人乘船下山； to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. 
      <i>
        There
      </i>
       is his home; 
      <i>
        there
      </i>
       lies his business, which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
