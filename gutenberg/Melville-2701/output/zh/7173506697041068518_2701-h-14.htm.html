      第 67 章切入。
    </h2>
    <p>
      那是一个星期六晚上，接下来就是安息日了！打破安息日的当然教授都是捕鲸人。象牙色的 Pequod 变成了一团乱麻；每个水手都是屠夫。你会以为我们是在向海神献上一万头红牛。
    </p>
    <p>
      首先，巨大的铲车，以及其他一些沉重的东西，包括一串通常涂成绿色的块，没有一个人可以举起来——这一大串葡萄被摇晃到主顶上，并牢牢地绑在上面下桅杆头，船甲板以上任何地方的最强点。缠绕在这些错综复杂的东西上的缆绳状绳索的末端随后被引导到绞车上，巨大的滑车下部滑车在鲸鱼上方摆动；重约一百磅的巨大鲸脂钩挂在这个石块上。现在，Starbuck 和 Stubb 分阶段悬挂在侧面，副手 Starbuck 和 Stubb 手持长铲，开始在船体上切一个洞，以便将钩子插入最近的两个侧鳍上方。完成后，在洞周围划出一条宽阔的半圆形线，插入钩子，船员的主体发出狂野的合唱，现在开始在起锚机旁的密集人群中起伏。瞬间，整艘船都向她倾斜；她身上的每一个螺栓都像寒冷天气里老房子的钉头一样开始；她颤抖着，颤抖着，把她受惊的桅杆顶向天空点头。她越来越靠向鲸鱼，同时卷扬机的每一次喘息都得到巨浪的帮助。直到最后，听到一声迅捷、惊人的啪啪声；随着巨大的摆动，船从鲸鱼身边向上和向后滚动，胜利的滑车升入视线，拖着它拖着第一条鲸脂的脱离的半圆形末端。现在，正如鲸脂包裹着鲸鱼，就像外皮包裹着橙子一样，它也被从身体上剥下来，就像有时通过螺旋形剥落橙子一样。因为起锚机不断保持的压力不断地使鲸鱼在水中翻来覆去，当一条带状的脂肪沿着被称为“围巾”的线均匀地剥落时，同时被 Starbuck 和 Stubb 的铲子切割，伙伴们；就在它被剥离的同时，实际上正是通过这种行为本身，它一直被提升得越来越高，直到它的上端擦过主顶部；起锚机旁的人随后停止起伏，有一两分钟，巨大的、滴着血的团块来回摇晃，就好像从天上掉下来一样，当它摇摆时，在场的每个人都必须小心躲避它，否则它可能会打他的耳朵，让他头朝下落水。
    </p>
    <p>
      一名在场的标枪手拿着一把又长又锋利的武器——登船剑——走上前去，他抓住机会，灵巧地在摇摆不定的物体下部切出了一个相当大的洞。在这个洞里，第二个交替的大滑车的末端被钩住，以保持对鲸脂的控制，以便为接下来的比赛做准备。于是，这位多才多艺的剑客，警告所有的手都站开，再次科学地冲向那团东西，并用几下侧身、绝望的、突进的切片，将它完全切成两半；因此，当较短的下部仍然很快时，称为毯子的长上部条带摆动清晰，并已准备好下降。向前的起重工现在恢复了他们的歌声，当一个滑车从鲸鱼身上剥下并吊起第二条带子时，另一个则慢慢松开，第一条带子向下穿过正下方的主舱口，进入一个没有家具的客厅，叫做鲸脂室。走进这间昏暗的公寓，各式各样灵活的手不停地卷起那条长毯子，就好像它是一大群活生生的编成辫子的蛇。工作就这样进行；两个滑车同时起升和下降；鲸鱼和起锚机在起伏，起重船在歌唱，起鲸室的绅士们盘绕着，伙伴们在擦肩而过，船在紧张，所有人的手偶尔都在咒骂，以缓和一般的摩擦。

      第 68 章。毯子。
    </h2>
    <p>
      我对鲸鱼的皮肤这个并非没有问题的主题给予了不小的关注。我曾与漂浮的经验丰富的捕鲸人和岸上博学的博物学家就此争论不休。原意见不变；但这只是一种意见。
    </p>
    <p>
      问题是，鲸鱼的皮肤是什么，在哪里？你已经知道他的脂肪是什么了。这种脂肪有点像坚硬、细粒的牛肉，但更坚韧、更有弹性、更紧凑，厚度从八英寸或十英寸到十二英寸和十五英寸不等。
    </p>
    <p>
      说任何生物的皮肤都具有那种质地和厚度，乍一看似乎很荒谬，但事实上，这些都不是反对这种假设的论据；因为你不能从鲸鱼的身体中取出任何其他致密的包裹层，但同样的脂肪；任何动物的最外层包裹层，如果相当致密，那除了皮肤还能是什么？诚然，从鲸鱼完好无损的尸体上，你可以用手刮下一种无限薄的透明物质，有点像最薄的鱼胶碎片，只不过它几乎像缎子一样柔韧柔软；也就是说，在干燥之前，它不仅收缩和变稠，而且变得相当硬和脆。我有几个这样的干碎片，我用它来标记我的鲸鱼书。正如我之前所说，它是透明的；放在印刷的页面上，有时我很高兴自己想象它产生了放大的影响。无论如何，如您所说，通过鲸鱼自己的眼镜阅读有关鲸鱼的文章是令人愉快的。但我在这里开车的是这个。同一种无限薄的鱼胶物质，我承认，覆盖了鲸鱼的整个身体，与其说是生物的皮肤，不如说是皮肤的皮肤；因为如果说巨鲸的真皮比新生儿的皮肤更薄、更嫩，那简直是荒谬的。但没有更多的了。
    </p>
    <p>
      假设鲸脂是鲸鱼的皮肤；然后，当这种皮肤，就像一条非常大的抹香鲸的皮肤一样，将产生一百桶石油的大部分；而且，当考虑到油在其表达状态下的数量或更确切地说是重量时，只有四分之三，而不是外套的全部物质；因此，人们可能对那充满活力的物质的巨大性有了一些想法，仅仅是其表皮的一部分就产生了这样一个液体湖。以十桶为一吨计算，鲸鱼皮的四分之三的净重只有十吨。
    </p>
    <p>
      在生活中，抹香鲸的可见表面并不是他所呈现的众多奇迹中最不重要的一个。几乎无一例外地，它到处都是倾斜的交叉和重新交叉，上面有无数笔直的标记，排成一排，就像最好的意大利线条版画中的那些。不过这些印记，似乎并不是刻在上述的鱼胶上，而是透过它，仿佛刻在了身体上。这还不是全部。在某些情况下，对于敏锐、敏锐的眼睛来说，那些线性标记就像真正的版画一样，但却为其他描绘提供了基础。这些是象形文字；也就是说，如果您将金字塔墙壁上的那些神秘密码称为象形文字，那么在当前连接中使用该词是合适的。由于我对一只抹香鲸身上的象形文字记忆犹新，我对一块刻在密西西比河上游著名象形文字栅栏上的古老印第安字符的盘子印象深刻。就像那些神秘的岩石一样，神秘标记的鲸鱼仍然无法辨认。这个对印度岩石的暗示让我想起了另一件事。除了抹香鲸外表所呈现的所有其他现象外，他并不少见地展示背部，尤其是他的侧腹，由于无数粗鲁的划痕，完全消失了大部分规则的线性外观，完全是不规则的，随机的方面。我应该说那些新英格兰海岸的岩石，阿加西想象它们带有与巨大的漂浮冰山剧烈刮擦接触的痕迹——我应该说，这些岩石在这一点上一定与抹香鲸有点相似。在我看来，鲸鱼身上的这种划痕可能是由于与其他鲸鱼的敌对接触造成的；因为我在该物种的成年大公牛身上观察得最多。
    </p>
    <p>
      关于鲸鱼的皮肤或脂肪的问题，再说一两句话。已经说过，它是从他身上剥下来的长条，称为毯子。像大多数海洋术语一样，这个术语非常快乐且意义重大。因为鲸鱼确实包裹在他的脂肪中，就像包裹在真正的毯子或床单中一样；或者，更好的是，一件印第安雨披披在他的头上，绕过他的四肢。正是由于这种舒适的毛毯，鲸鱼才能在所有天气、所有海洋、时间和潮汐中保持舒适。比方说，如果格陵兰鲸在北方那些颤抖、冰冷的海域中得不到舒适的喘息，它会变成什么样子呢？诚然，在北领地的那些水域中发现了其他鱼类，它们非常活跃；但是请注意，这些是没有肺的冷血鱼，它们的肚子就是冰箱；生物，在冰山的背风处取暖，就像冬天的旅行者在旅馆的火炉前晒太阳一样；而与人一样，鲸鱼也有肺和温暖的血液。冻结他的血液，他就死了。那么，除了解释之后，这个巨大的怪物是多么奇妙，身体的温暖对他来说就像对人类一样不可或缺；他竟然在家里，在北极的水域里终生沉浸在他的唇边，真是太好了！在那里，当海员落水时，有时会在几个月后被发现，他们被垂直地冻结在冰原的中心，就像一只苍蝇被发现粘在琥珀中一样。但更令人惊讶的是，正如实验所证明的那样，在夏季，北极鲸的血液比婆罗洲黑人的血液更温暖。
    </p>
    <p>
      在我看来，在这里我们确实看到了强大的个体生命力的难得优点，厚墙的难得优点，以及内部宽敞的难得优点。天啊！以鲸鱼为榜样，佩服自己！你也一样，在冰中保持温暖。你是否也生活在这个世界上而不属于它。在赤道保持凉爽；把你的血液留在极地。像圣彼得大教堂的圆顶，像大鲸鱼，留住，哦人类！四季都有属于你的温度。
    </p>
    <p>
      但是教这些美好的东西是多么容易，多么无望！在勃起中，很少有像圣彼得大教堂那样圆顶的！在生物中，像鲸鱼这样巨大的生物是多么少啊！

      第 69 章葬礼。
    </h2>
    <p>
       “拉上锁链！让尸体往后退！”
    </p>
    <p>
      巨大的铲球现在已经完成了他们的职责。被斩首的鲸鱼剥落的白色身体像大理石坟墓一样闪闪发光；尽管颜色发生了变化，但它并没有明显地丢失任何东西。它仍然是巨大的。慢慢地，它漂得越来越远，它周围的水被贪得无厌的鲨鱼撕裂和溅起，头顶的空气中充满了尖叫的禽类贪婪的飞行，它们的喙就像鲸鱼身上许多侮辱性的短剑。巨大的白色无头幽灵漂浮在离船越来越远的地方，它漂浮的每一根鱼竿，似乎是方形的鲨鱼和立方体的家禽，都增加了杀气腾腾的喧嚣。从几乎静止的船上看到可怕的景象几个小时。在无云而温和的蔚蓝天空下，在宜人的大海的美丽表面上，在愉快的微风中飘荡，那巨大的死亡之团不断漂浮，直到消失在无限的视野中。
    </p>
    <p>
      这是一场最凄凉、最可笑的葬礼！海雕都在虔诚地哀悼，空气中的鲨鱼都穿着黑色或有斑点的衣服。在生活中，他们中很少有人会帮助鲸鱼，我想，如果碰巧他需要它的话；但在他的葬礼宴会上，他们最虔诚地扑了上去。哦，地球上可怕的秃鹰！没有最强大的鲸鱼是免费的。
    </p>
    <p>
      这也不是结束。尽管尸体遭到亵渎，但复仇的幽灵幸存下来并在其上方盘旋以吓唬人。被一些胆小的战舰或笨手笨脚的探索船从远处窥视，当远处遮住了成群的鸟儿时，仍然可以看到阳光下漂浮的白色物体，白色的浪花在上面高高扬起；鲸鱼毫发无伤的尸体，用颤抖的手指直接放在圆木上
      <i>
        ——附近有浅滩、岩石和碎浪：当心！
      </i>
      或许多年以后，船只都避开了这个地方；跳过它就像傻羊跳过真空一样，因为他们的领导者最初是在拿着一根棍子的情况下跳到那里的。这是你的先例法则；有你对传统的效用；这是关于您顽固地坚持古老信念的故事，这些信念从未在地球上触底，现在甚至没有在空中盘旋！有正统！
    </p>
    <p>
      因此，虽然大鲸鱼的身体在生前可能对他的敌人来说是一个真正的恐惧，但在他死后，他的鬼魂却对世界造成了无能为力的恐慌。
    </p>
    <p>
      你相信鬼魂吗，我的朋友？除了 Cock-Lane 的鬼魂之外，还有其他鬼魂，还有比相信他们的约翰逊医生更深刻的人。

      第 70 章斯芬克斯。
    </h2>
    <p>
      不容忽视的是，在将这头巨兽的身体完全剥离之前，他就被斩首了。现在，抹香鲸的斩首是一项科学的解剖学壮举，经验丰富的鲸鱼外科医生对此感到非常自豪：这并非没有道理。
    </p>
    <p>
      考虑到鲸鱼没有任何可以恰当地称为脖子的东西；相反，在他的头和身体似乎连接的地方，正是那个地方，是他最粗的部分。还要记住，外科医生必须从上方操作，他和他的对象之间大约有八到十英尺的距离，而对象几乎隐藏在一片变色、翻滚、经常是汹涌和爆裂的大海中。还要记住，在这些不幸的情况下，他不得不在肉体上切开很多脚；以这种隐秘的方式，他必须巧妙地避开所有相邻的、被禁止的部分，并在一个关键点准确地分割脊柱，因为它插入到脊柱中。颅骨。那么，你不会对斯塔布吹嘘他只需要十分钟就可以斩首一头抹香鲸感到惊讶吗？
    </p>
    <p>
      第一次被切断时，头部掉在船尾并用绳索固定在那里，直到身体被剥离。完成后，如果它属于小鲸鱼，则将其悬挂在甲板上以便有意处置。但是，对于一只成年的海兽来说，这是不可能的；因为抹香鲸的头几乎占了它整个体积的三分之一，要完全吊起这样的重物，即使是捕鲸者的巨大钓具，这也像试图用珠宝商的天平称荷兰谷仓一样徒劳.
    </p>
    <p>
       Pequod 的鲸鱼被斩首，身体被剥光，头被吊在船舷上——大约露出海的一半，这样它在很大程度上可能会被它的原生元素支撑起来。由于下桅杆头的巨大向下阻力，那艘紧张的船陡然倾斜到它身上，那一侧的每根帆船臂都像起重机一样伸出海浪；在那里，那个滴血的脑袋挂在 Pequod 的腰上，就像巨人 Holofernes 的脑袋从 Judith 的腰带上垂下来一样。
    </p>
    <p>
      当这最后一项任务完成时，已经是中午了，海员们到下面去吃晚饭。寂静笼罩着之前喧闹但现在空无一人的甲板。一种强烈的铜色平静，就像一朵普世的黄色莲花，在海面上越来越多地展开它无声无息的叶子。
    </p>
    <p>
      短暂的空间过去了，亚哈独自一人从他的船舱里走出来，进入了这寂静之中。在尾甲板上转了几圈，他停下来凝视着侧面，然后慢慢地进入主链，他拿起斯塔布的长铲——在鲸鱼被斩首后仍然留在那里——并将它击入半甲板的下半部分- 悬垂物，将另一端拐杖放在一只胳膊下，然后俯身站着，眼睛专注地盯着这个头。
    </p>
    <p>
      那是一个戴着兜帽的黑色脑袋；悬在如此强烈的平静之中，仿佛沙漠中的斯芬克斯。 “说吧，你这伟大而可敬的脑袋，”亚哈喃喃地说，“虽然没有胡须，但到处都长满了苔藓，显得苍白无力；说话吧，强大的头脑，告诉我们你体内的秘密。在所有潜水员中，你潜得最深。上层太阳现在在其上闪闪发光的那个头，已经在这个世界的地基中移动了。未被记录的名字和海军在那里生锈，无数的希望和锚腐烂；在她凶残的堡垒中，这艘护卫舰地球上压载着数百万溺水者的骨头；在那可怕的水域里，有你最熟悉的家。你去过钟声或潜水员从未去过的地方；曾睡在许多水手身边，失眠的母亲愿意献出生命让他们躺下。从燃烧的船上跳下时，你看到了锁着的恋人；他们心连心地沉没在狂喜的波涛之下；当天堂对他们来说似乎是虚假的时，他们彼此真诚。你亲眼目睹了被海盗从半夜的甲板上扔下的被谋杀的大副；一连几个小时，他都陷入了贪得无厌的大嘴的更深的午夜。谋杀他的人仍然毫发无伤地继续航行——而迅疾的闪电使邻近的船只颤抖，这艘船本可以承载一位正直的丈夫，伸出张开渴望的双臂。头啊！你已经看到了足以分裂行星并使亚伯拉罕成为异教徒的事情，没有一个音节是你的！”
    </p>
    <p>
       “扬帆！”主桅顶传来胜利的声音。
    </p>
    <p>
       “嗯？好吧，现在，那是欢呼，”亚哈喊道，突然直起身子，整个雷雨云从他的额头上扫过。 “在这种致命的平静中发出的活泼的叫喊几乎可以改变一个更好的人。——去哪儿了？”
    </p>
    <p>
       “右舷船首的三个点，长官，把她的微风吹向我们！
    </p>
    <p>
       “越来越好，伙计。现在圣保罗会从那条路过来吗，把他的微风吹到我的微风中！大自然啊，人类的灵魂啊！您的相关类比超出了所有话语的范围！没有最小的原子在物质上活动或生存，而是在脑海中有其狡猾的复制品。”

      第 71 章。耶罗波安的故事。
    </h2>
    <p>
      船与风手牵手；但是微风来得比船快，很快 Pequod 开始摇晃。
    </p>
    <p>
      渐渐地，透过玻璃，陌生人的小船和有人驾驶的桅杆顶证明她是一艘捕鲸船。但是，由于她逆风而行，并且从身边掠过，显然是开辟了一条通往其他地方的通道，因此 Pequod 号不可能到达她身边。所以设置了信号，看看会有什么反应。
    </p>
    <p>
      可以这么说，就像海军陆战队的船只一样，美国鲸鱼舰队的每艘船只都有一个私人信号；所有这些信号都被收集在一本书中，并附有各自船只的名称，每位船长都会得到它。因此，鲸鱼指挥官能够在海洋上相互识别，即使在相当远的距离和不小的设施。
    </p>
    <p>
       Pequod 的信号最终得到了陌生人设置她自己的信号的响应；这证明这艘船是楠塔基特的耶罗波安号。她摆好船码，向下冲，在 Pequod 的背风面横梁，放下一艘船；很快就要到了。但是，由于星巴克的命令正在操纵舷梯以容纳来访的船长，这位陌生人从船尾挥了挥手，表示完全没有必要这样做。原来，耶罗波安号在船上感染了恶性传染病，她的船长梅休生怕传染给裴廓德号的船员。因为，尽管他和船上的船员都毫发无伤，尽管他的船被步枪射击了一半，而且一片不朽的大海和空气在其间翻滚流动；然而，由于认真遵守这片土地的胆小隔离区，他断然拒绝与 Pequod 直接接触。
    </p>
    <p>
      但这并没有阻止所有的交流。耶罗波安号的船在自己和船之间保持几码的距离，偶尔使用它的桨设法与 Pequod 保持平行，因为她在海中艰难地航行（因为此时它吹得非常新鲜），与她的主帆退缩了；不过，确实，有时突然出现的大波浪会把船推到前面。但很快就会熟练地回到她正确的方位。受此影响，以及其他类似的不时中断，双方之间进行了对话。但每隔一段时间，又会出现另一种截然不同的中断。
    </p>
    <p>
      在耶罗波安号的船上划桨，是一个有着独特外表的人，即使在那个个人名人构成所有整体的野外捕鲸生活中也是如此。他是个矮小的年轻人，满脸雀斑，一头蓬乱的黄头发。一件褪色的胡桃木色长裙、神秘主义剪裁的外套包裹着他。重叠的袖子卷在他的手腕上。他的眼中透出一种深沉、沉稳、狂热的神志。
    </p>
    <p>
      刚一看到这个人影，斯塔布就惊呼道——“就是他！就是他！——Town-Ho 的公司告诉我们的那个穿着长袍的 scaramouch！”斯塔布在这里提到了一个关于耶罗波安号和她的船员中的某个人的奇怪故事，之前一段时间，当佩廓德号说 Town-Ho 时。根据这个记述和后来了解到的情况，似乎所讨论的 scaramouch 已经获得了对耶罗波安几乎每个人的惊人优势。他的故事是这样的：
    </p>
    <p>
      他最初是在 Neskyeuna Shakers 的疯狂社会中成长起来的，在那里他是一位伟大的先知；在他们破裂的秘密会议上，他们几次通过活板门从天而降，宣布迅速打开他放在背心口袋里的第七个小瓶；但是，它应该含有鸦片酊，而不是火药。一种奇怪的、使徒式的突发奇想抓住了他，他离开了内斯基尤纳前往楠塔基特，在那里，他以疯狂特有的狡猾，装出一副稳重、常识性的外表，并提出自己是耶罗波安号捕鲸之旅的新手候选人。他们雇用了他；但就在船离开陆地视线后，他的精神错乱又爆发了。他宣布自己是大天使加百列，并命令船长跳下船。他发表了自己的宣言，宣称自己是海洋岛屿的拯救者和整个大洋洲的代理人。他宣布这些事情时所表现出的坚定不移的诚恳；——他不眠不休、兴奋的想象力的黑暗、大胆的游戏，以及真正的精神错乱所带来的所有超自然的恐惧，结合在一起，使这个加布里埃尔在大多数无知的船员的脑海中，以一种神圣的气氛。而且，他们还怕他。然而，由于这样一个人在船上没有多大实际用处，尤其是他拒绝在他高兴的时候工作，所以怀疑的船长很想摆脱他；但得知那个人的意图是让他在第一个方便的港口登陆，大天使立即打开了他所有的印章和小瓶——将船和所有人无条件地毁灭，以防这个意图被实现。他在船员中对他的门徒进行了如此强烈的工作，以至于他们最后一起去见船长，告诉他如果加布里埃尔被派出船，他们中的一个人都不会留下来。因此，他被迫放弃了他的计划。他们也不允许加布里埃尔受到任何形式的虐待，不允许他说或做他想做的事；这样一来，加布里埃尔就可以完全自由地使用这艘船了。所有这一切的结果是，天使长很少或根本不关心船长和副手；自从流行病爆发以来，他的手比以往任何时候都高。宣布瘟疫，正如他所说的那样，完全由他指挥；除非他高兴，否则也不应停止。水手们，大多是可怜虫，畏缩不前，其中一些人在他面前阿谀奉承。服从他的指示，有时对他表示个人的敬意，就像对神一样。这样的事情可能看起来不可思议；但是，无论多么奇妙，它们都是真实的。狂热者的历史也不会像狂热者自身无止尽的自欺欺人那样引人注目，因为他有无限的能力欺骗和骚扰许多其他人。但现在是回到 Pequod 的时候了。
    </p>
    <p>
       “我不害怕你的流行病，伙计，”亚哈在舷墙对站在船尾的梅休船长说。 “上船吧。”
    </p>
    <p>
      但现在加布里埃尔开始站起来。
    </p>
    <p>
       “想想，想想发烧，黄色和胆汁！小心可怕的瘟疫！”
    </p>
    <p>
       “加百列！加布里埃尔！梅休船长喊道。 “你必须——” 但就在这时，一股汹涌的浪潮将船冲向前方很远的地方，它的沸腾淹没了所有的言语。
    </p>
    <p>
       “你见过白鲸吗？”当船向后漂流时，亚哈问道。
    </p>
    <p>
       “想一想，想一想你的捕鲸船，被烧毁并沉没了！小心可怕的尾巴！”
    </p>
    <p>
       “我再一次告诉你，加布里埃尔，那——”但是船又一次像被恶魔拖着一样向前猛冲。片刻之间什么也没说，一连串狂暴的波浪翻滚而过，其中一个是大海偶尔的反复无常，是翻滚而不是起伏。与此同时，被吊起来的抹香鲸的头猛烈地摇晃着，加百列看着它的眼神比他的大天使天性所应有的还要忧虑。
    </p>
    <p>
      这段插曲结束后，梅休船长开始讲述关于白鲸记的黑暗故事。然而，每当提到他的名字，以及似乎与他同盟的疯狂大海时，加布里埃尔经常打断他的话。
    </p>
    <p>
      耶罗波安号似乎离开家不久，在对一艘捕鲸船讲话时，她的人民可靠地得知了莫比·迪克的存在，以及他造成的破坏。贪婪地吸取着这份情报，加百列郑重警告船长不要攻击白鲸，以免被人看到。在他胡言乱语的精神错乱中，宣称白鲸不亚于振动神的化身；震教徒收到圣经。但是，一两年后，当从桅顶上清晰地看到白鲸记时，大副梅西热情洋溢地迎接他。船长本人也不愿意让他有机会，尽管天使长一再谴责和警告，但梅西还是成功说服了五个人为他的船掌舵。他和他们一起出发了；在费力地拉动了很多次之后，经过了多次危险的、不成功的尝试之后，他终于成功地快速抓住了一根熨斗。与此同时，加布里埃尔登上皇家主桅杆顶，疯狂地挥舞着一只手臂，向亵渎他神性的攻击者发出厄运即将来临的预言。现在，当大副 Macey 站在他的船头时，带着他的部落所有鲁莽的能量向鲸鱼发泄他的疯狂惊呼，并试图为他的长矛争取一个公平的机会，看！一道宽阔的白影从海中升起；通过它快速、扇动的动作，暂时让桨手们喘不过气来。下一刻，倒霉的大副，充满了愤怒的生命，身体被击飞到空中，在下降的过程中划出一个长弧，在大约五十码的距离处坠入海中。船的一块碎片没有受到伤害，任何桨手的头发也没有受到伤害；但伴侣永远沉没了。
    </p>
    <p>
      最好在这里加上括号，在抹香鲸渔业中的致命事故中，这种事故可能几乎和其他事故一样频繁。有时，除了被毁灭的人之外，什么也没有受到伤害；更常见的是，船头被撞倒，或者刽子手站立的大腿板从原处撕裂并与尸体相伴。但最奇怪的是，在不止一次的情况下，当尸体被找回时，看不到任何暴力痕迹；那人已经死了。
    </p>
    <p>
      整场灾难，连同梅西倒下的身影，从船上一目了然。发出一声刺耳的尖叫——“小瓶！小瓶！”加布里埃尔让惊恐的船员停止进一步捕鲸。这件可怕的事情给天使长带来了更大的影响。因为他轻信的弟子们认为他已经明确地预先宣布了它，而不是只是做出一般性的预言，而任何人都可能这样做，因此有机会在允许的广泛范围内命中许多标记中的一个。他成了这艘船上无名的恐怖分子。
    </p>
    <p>
      梅休结束了他的叙述，亚哈向他提出了这样的问题，以至于陌生船长忍不住问他是否打算在有机会的情况下猎杀白鲸。亚哈回答说：“是的。”紧接着，加百列又一次站起来，瞪着老人，用向下指的手指激烈地叫道——“想想，想想亵渎者——死了，在下面！——小心亵渎者的下场！”
    </p>
    <p>
      亚哈不动声色地转过身去。然后对梅休说，“船长，我刚刚想起了我的信袋；如果我没记错的话，有一封信是给你的一位军官的。星巴克，检查一下袋子。”
    </p>
    <p>
      每艘捕鲸船都为不同的船只取出大量的信件，这些信件是否能够交付给收件人，取决于在四大洋中遇到他们的机会。因此，大多数字母永远达不到他们的目标；许多人在两岁或三岁或更长时间后才被接受。
    </p>
    <p>
      很快星巴克就回来了，手里拿着一封信。由于存放在机舱的一个黑暗储物柜中，它已经翻滚得很厉害，很潮湿，上面覆盖着一层暗淡的、有斑点的绿色霉菌。对于这样一封信，死神本人很可能就是邮递员。
    </p>
    <p>
       “不能不读吗？”亚哈叫道。 “给我，伙计。是的，是的，这只是一个模糊的潦草字迹；——这是什么？”星巴克一边研究，一边拿了一根长长的铲刀，用小刀稍微劈开一端，把信塞进去，就这样递到船上，不让船靠得更近。 .
    </p>
    <p>
      与此同时，亚哈拿着信，喃喃地说：“先生。哈——是的，哈利先生——（一个女人的小手，——男人的妻子，我敢打赌）——是的——先生。 Harry Macey，Jeroboam 号船；——为什么是 Macey，他死了！”
    </p>
    <p>
       “可怜的家伙！可怜的家伙！还有他的妻子，”梅休叹息道。 “但让我拥有它。”
    </p>
    <p>
       “不，你自己拿着吧，”加布里埃尔对亚哈喊道。 “thou art soon going that way.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck&#39;s hands, he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship&#39;s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel&#39;s eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab&#39;s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
       As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair.

       CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale&#39;s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster&#39;s back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Being the savage&#39;s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale&#39;s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the ship&#39;s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
       It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to Queequeg&#39;s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.
    </p>
    <p>
       So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another&#39;s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg&#39;s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*
    </p>
    <p>
       *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
    </p>
    <p>
       And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg&#39;s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
    </p>
    <p>
       Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
    </p>
    <p>
       But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. “Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you please.” Then watching the mate&#39;s countenance, he added, “The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we&#39;ll teach you to drug a harpooneer; none of your apothecary&#39;s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the captain&#39;s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a whale.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don&#39;t hit him again, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that sort; and this fellow&#39;s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity&#39;s gift, and that was freely given to the waves.

       CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk over Him.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale&#39;s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod&#39;s side. But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats, Stubb&#39;s and Flask&#39;s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel&#39;s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale&#39;s body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock.
    </p>
    <p>
       At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he turned upon his back a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
       While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation ensued between them.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat&#39;s bow, “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale&#39;s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale&#39;s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
       “I don&#39;t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he seems to know all about ships&#39; charms. But I sometimes think he&#39;ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don&#39;t half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake&#39;s head, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship? He&#39;s the devil, I say. The reason why you don&#39;t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he&#39;s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “He sleeps in his boots, don&#39;t he? He hasn&#39;t got any hammock; but I&#39;ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No doubt, and it&#39;s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye see, in the eye of the rigging.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bargain?—about what?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he&#39;ll surrender Moby Dick.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I don&#39;t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, &#39;I want John.&#39; &#39;What for?&#39; says the old governor. &#39;What business is that of yours,&#39; says the devil, getting mad,—&#39;I want to use him.&#39; &#39;Take him,&#39; says the governor—and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn&#39;t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I&#39;ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp—ain&#39;t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let&#39;s get the whale alongside.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship, “but I can&#39;t remember where.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn&#39;t the devil live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral&#39;s cabin, don&#39;t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that&#39;s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod&#39;s hold, and string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn&#39;t begin to be Fedallah&#39;s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn&#39;t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he&#39;s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me that?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But he&#39;d crawl back.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and drown you—what then?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I should like to see him try it; I&#39;d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn&#39;t dare to show his face in the admiral&#39;s cabin again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I&#39;m afraid of the devil? Who&#39;s afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn&#39;t catch him and put him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he&#39;d roast for him? There&#39;s a governor!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do I suppose it? You&#39;ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going on, I&#39;ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look here, Beelzebub, you don&#39;t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I&#39;ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he&#39;ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Didn&#39;t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you&#39;ll soon see this right whale&#39;s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti&#39;s.”
    </p>
    <p>
       In good time, Flask&#39;s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale&#39;s head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke&#39;s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant&#39;s and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.
    </p>
    <p>
       In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale&#39;s head, and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee&#39;s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab&#39;s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.
