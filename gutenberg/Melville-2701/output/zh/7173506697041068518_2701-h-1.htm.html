      第 1 章隐现。
    </h2>
    <p>
      叫我以实玛利。几年前——不管具体多长时间——我钱包里几乎没有钱，在岸上也没有什么特别让我感兴趣的，我想我会航行一点，看看世界的水域。这是我有的一种祛脾调血的方法。每当我发现自己的嘴巴变得冷酷时；每当我灵魂中潮湿阴雨的十一月；每当我发现自己不由自主地在棺材仓库前停下来，并在我遇到的每一个葬礼上走在后面时；尤其是当我的假说占了上风时，需要强烈的道德原则来阻止我故意走上街头，有条不紊地敲掉人们的帽子——然后，我认为是时候尽快出海了如我所能。这是我的手枪和球的替代品。卡托带着哲学的蓬勃发展投身于他的剑中；我悄悄地走上了船。这并不奇怪。如果他们知道的话，几乎所有同学历的人，或多或少，都会和我一样对海洋怀有几乎相同的感情。
    </p>
    <p>
      现在你的岛屿城市曼哈托斯 (Manhattoes) 被码头环绕，就像印度小岛被珊瑚礁环绕一样——商业用她的海浪环绕着它。左右，街道带你走向水边。它最远的市中心是炮台，那颗高贵的鼹鼠在那里被海浪冲刷，被微风吹凉，几个小时前这里还看不到陆地。看看那里成群结队的观水者。
    </p>
    <p>
      环绕一个梦幻般的安息日下午的城市。从 Corlears Hook 到 Coenties Slip，然后从那里经过 Whitehall，向北行驶。你看到了什么？——像沉默的哨兵一样张贴在城镇周围，成千上万的凡人正沉浸在海洋的遐想中。有的靠在桩上；一些坐在码头上；有的在眺望中国船只的舷墙；一些高高的索具，好像在努力更好地窥视大海。但这些都是陆地人；工作日被板条和石膏压抑——绑在柜台上，钉在长凳上，固定在桌子上。那这是怎么回事？绿色的田野消失了吗？他们在这里做什么？
    </p>
    <p>
      但看！这里来了更多的人群，直奔水面，似乎要去潜水。奇怪的！除了这片土地的尽头，没有什么能满足他们；在那边仓库的阴凉处闲逛是不够的。不。他们必须尽可能地靠近水面而不落入水中。他们站在那里——绵延数英里——联盟。都是内地人，他们来自四面八方的巷弄、大街小巷——东西南北。然而在这里，他们都团结在一起。告诉我，所有那些船的罗盘针的磁力是否将它们吸引到那里？
    </p>
    <p>
      再一次。假设你在乡下；在一些高地的湖泊。几乎可以随心所欲地走任何一条路，十比一它会把你带到山谷里，然后把你留在溪流的一个池塘边。这里面有魔力。让最心不在焉的人陷入他最深沉的遐想——让那个人站起来，双脚向前移动，如果整个地区都有水，他会准确无误地把你带到水边。如果你在美国的大沙漠里感到口渴，试试这个实验，如果你的大篷车碰巧配备了一位形而上学的教授。是的，众所周知，冥想和水是永远结合在一起的。
    </p>
    <p>
      但这里有一位艺术家。他希望为您描绘 Saco 山谷中最梦幻、最阴暗、最安静、最迷人的浪漫风景。他使用的主要元素是什么？那里矗立着他的树木，每棵树都有一个空心的树干，仿佛里面有一个隐士和一个十字架。这里睡着他的草地，那里睡着他的牲畜；一股昏昏欲睡的烟雾从那边的小屋升起。深入遥远的林地，蜿蜒曲折，到达沐浴在山坡蓝色中的重叠山脉。但是，尽管这幅画是这样出神的，尽管这棵松树像树叶一样在这个牧羊人的头上摇下它的叹息，但一切都是徒劳的，除非牧羊人的眼睛盯着他面前的魔法溪流。六月去参观大草原，当你在虎百合中跋涉数十英里时，你会在齐膝深的地方跋涉——你想要的魅力是什么？——水——那里一滴水也没有！如果尼亚加拉瀑布只是一片沙砾，你会不远千里去看它吗？为什么这位田纳西州的可怜诗人在突然收到两把银子时，会考虑是给他买一件他急需的外套，还是花钱去洛克威海滩徒步旅行？为什么几乎每一个身体强壮、内心健康的男孩，都会在某个时候或其他时候疯狂地出海？为什么在你作为乘客的第一次航行中，当第一次被告知你和你的船现在已经远离陆地时，你自己会感到如此神秘的震动吗？为什么古代波斯人将大海奉为圣地？为什么希腊人给它一个单独的神，和朱庇特自己的兄弟？当然，这一切并非毫无意义。 Narcissus 的故事还有更深的含义，因为他无法理解他在喷泉中看到的令人痛苦、温和的形象，于是跳入其中淹死了。但是同样的形象，我们自己在所有的河流和海洋中都看到了。它是不可捉摸的生命幻影的形象；这是这一切的关键。
    </p>
    <p>
      现在，当我说每当我的眼睛开始变得模糊，并且开始对我的肺部过度敏感时，我就养成了出海的习惯，我并不是说我曾经出过海，因为一位乘客。作为一名乘客，你必须有一个钱包，而钱包只是一块破布，除非你里面有东西。此外，乘客会晕船——爱吵架——晚上睡不着觉——一般情况下，他们不会很开心；——不，我从不作为乘客去；也，虽然我有点像盐，但我从来没有以准将、船长或厨师的身份出海。我将这种职位的荣耀和尊贵让给喜欢它们的人。就我而言，我厌恶所有体面的劳动、考验和各种磨难。照顾好自己已经是我力所能及的事了，不用照顾船只、三桅小帆船、双桅帆船、纵帆船等等。至于当厨师，——虽然我承认这有相当大的荣耀，厨师是一种船上的军官——然而，不知何故，我从来不喜欢烤家禽；——虽然一旦烤过，明智地涂上黄油，并且有判断力盐和胡椒，没有人会比我更恭敬地，更不用说虔诚地谈论一只烤鸡了。正是出于古埃及人对烤朱鹭和烤河马的偶像崇拜，你才能在金字塔巨大的烤房中看到这些生物的木乃伊。
    </p>
    <p>
      不，当我出海时，我只是一个简单的水手，就在桅杆前，直下船艏楼，高高地到达皇家桅杆顶。是的，他们宁愿命令我一些，让我从一个晶石跳到另一个晶石，就像五月草地上的一只蚱蜢。起初，这种事情已经够不愉快的了。它触动了一个人的荣誉感，特别是如果你来自这片土地上一个古老的家族，范伦斯勒家族、伦道夫家族或哈迪卡努特家族。更重要的是，如果就在把手伸进焦油罐之前，你一直以乡村教师的身份称霸，让最高的男孩对你敬畏。我向你保证，从校长到水手的转变是一个敏锐的转变，需要塞内卡和斯多葛学派的浓烈煎熬才能让你咧嘴笑着接受它。但即使这样也会及时消失。
    </p>
    <p>
      怎么办，如果某个船长的老帅哥命令我拿把扫帚扫甲板呢？我的意思是，在新约的天平上，这种侮辱意味着什么？你认为大天使加百列看不起我吗，因为我在那个特定情况下迅速而恭敬地服从了那些老家伙？谁不是奴隶？告诉我。好吧，那么，无论老船长们如何命令我——无论他们如何对我拳打脚踢，我很高兴知道这没问题；每个人都以一种或另一种方式以几乎相同的方式服务——无论是从物理的还是形而上学的角度来看，也就是说；因此，普遍的重击传遍了，所有的手都应该互相摩擦肩胛骨，并感到满足。
    </p>
    <p>
      再一次，我总是以水手的身份出海，因为他们会为我的麻烦付钱给我，而我听说过他们从不付给乘客一分钱。反之，则必须由乘客自己支付。支付和被支付之间存在天壤之别。付钱可能是这两个果园小偷给我们带来的最不舒服的伤害。但是
      <i>
        得到报酬
      </i>
      ——有什么能与之相比呢？考虑到我们如此真诚地相信金钱是世间万病之源，有钱人无论如何也进不了天堂，一个人收钱的文雅行为真是了不起。啊!我们多么高兴地把自己交给灭亡！
    </p>
    <p>
      最后，我总是以水手的身份出海，因为船首甲板上的有益健康的运动和清新的空气。因为在这个世界上，逆风比逆风更普遍（也就是说，如果你从不违反毕达哥拉斯格言），所以在大多数情况下，后甲板上的准将从水手那里获得二手空气在船艏楼上。他认为他先呼吸了它；但事实并非如此。在许多其他事情上，普通民众以几乎相同的方式领导他们的领导人，同时领导人很少怀疑这一点。但为何当过商船水手，屡闻海味，如今竟想出海捕鲸；这是命运的隐形警察，他时刻监视着我，暗中跟踪我，以某种莫名其妙的方式影响着我——他比任何人都能更好地回答。而且，毫无疑问，我进行这次捕鲸航行是很久以前制定的普罗维登斯宏伟计划的一部分。它作为更广泛的表演之间的短暂插曲和独奏出现。我认为法案的这一部分一定是这样的：
    </p>
    <p>
       “
      <i>
        盛大的美国总统选举。
      </i>
       “一个伊什梅尔的捕鲸之旅。 “阿富汗的血战。”
    </p>
    <p>
      虽然我不知道为什么那些舞台经理，命运之神，让我因为捕鲸航行中的这个卑鄙的部分而失望，而其他人则因为在高悲剧中的宏伟部分而被拒绝，而在优雅的喜剧中扮演简短而轻松的角色，并且闹剧中的欢快部分——虽然我说不出这是为什么；然而，现在我回忆起所有的情况，我想我可以稍微看清在各种伪装下巧妙地呈现给我的动机和动机，诱使我开始执行我所做的部分，除了哄骗我进入错觉之外这是我自己公正的自由意志和歧视性判断的选择。
    </p>
    <p>
      这些动机中最主要的是对大鲸鱼本身的压倒性想法。如此凶悍神秘的怪物，勾起了我所有的好奇心。然后是狂野而遥远的大海，他在那里滚动着他的岛屿；鲸鱼无法解决的、无名的危险；这些，加上巴塔哥尼亚一千种景象和声音的所有奇迹，帮助我实现了自己的愿望。对于其他人，也许，这样的事情不会是诱因；但对我来说，我被对遥远事物的永恒渴望所折磨。我喜欢在禁海航行，在野蛮的海岸登陆。不忽视好的一面，我很快就能察觉到恐惧，并且仍然可以与之交往——他们会允许我吗——因为与一个住所的所有囚犯保持友好关系是很好的。
    </p>
    <p>
      因此，捕鲸之旅受到欢迎。奇妙世界的巨大闸门打开了，在狂野的自负中，使我达到了我的目的，两只又两只漂浮在我的灵魂深处，鲸鱼的无尽游行，而且，在他们中的大多数人中，一只巨大的兜帽虚影，犹如一座凌空的雪山。

      第 2 章地毯包。
    </h2>
    <p>
      我把一两件衬衫塞进我的旧地毯包里，夹在胳膊下，动身前往合恩角和太平洋。离开古老的曼哈托这座美好的城市，我如期到达了新贝德福德。那是十二月的一个星期六晚上。得知去楠塔基特的小包裹已经启航，而且要到下个星期一才能到达那个地方，我感到非常失望。
    </p>
    <p>
      由于大多数年轻的候选人都因捕鲸的痛苦和惩罚而停在同一个新贝德福德，从那里开始他们的航行，这也可能与我，例如，不知道这样做有关。因为我下定决心只乘南塔基特的一艘船航行，因为与那个著名的古老岛屿有关的一切都有一种美妙、喧闹的东西，这让我非常高兴。此外，尽管新贝德福德最近逐渐垄断了捕鲸业，尽管在这件事上可怜的老楠塔基特现在已经远远落后于她，但楠塔基特是她伟大的原创——这个迦太基的轮胎——第一个死去的美国人鲸鱼搁浅了。除了楠塔基特，那些土著捕鲸人，红人，还有什么地方首先乘独木舟出海追逐利维坦？除了南塔基特岛，第一艘冒险的小单桅帆船也是从哪里出发的，部分装载了进口鹅卵石——故事就是这样——向鲸鱼投掷，以便发现它们何时足够接近，可以从船首斜桅上冒出鱼叉的风险？
    </p>
    <p>
      现在在新贝德福德有一个晚上，一天，又一个晚上在我面前，在我可以启程前往我的预定港口之前，我很关心同时在哪里吃饭和睡觉。这是一个非常可疑的，不，一个非常黑暗和阴沉的夜晚，刺骨的寒冷和冷清。我在这个地方不认识任何人。我用焦急的抓钩摸了摸口袋，只带了几块银子，——所以，无论你去哪里，伊什梅尔，我对自己说，当我站在一条沉闷的街道中间，背着我的包，比​​较北方一片黑暗，南方一片黑暗——亲爱的伊斯梅尔，根据你的智慧，无论你决定在哪里过夜，一定要问清楚价格，不要太挑剔。
    </p>
    <p>
      我脚步蹒跚地在街上走来走去，经过了“十字鱼叉”的牌子——但那里看起来太贵了，也太欢乐了。再往前，“剑鱼客栈”鲜红的窗子里射出炽热的光芒，似乎把屋前的积雪和冰都融化了，因为其他地方都结了十英寸厚的冰霜。坚硬的柏油路面——当我的脚踩在坚硬的突起物上时，我感到相当疲倦，因为由于艰苦、无情的工作，我的靴底处于最悲惨的境地。太贵了，太快乐了，我又一次想，停下片刻，看着街上耀眼的灯光，听到里面玻璃杯的叮当声。但是继续吧，伊斯梅尔，我最后说道；你没听见吗？远离门前；你打补丁的靴子挡住了路。所以我去了。现在，我本能地沿着通往水边的街道前行，因为那里无疑是最便宜的旅馆，即使不是最热闹的旅馆。
    </p>
    <p>
      多么沉闷的街道！两边是黑色的街区，不是房屋，到处都是蜡烛，就像在坟墓里移动的蜡烛。在这个星期的最后一天的晚上的这个时候，镇上的那个街区几乎空无一人。但不久我就看到一幢低矮宽阔的建筑物发出烟雾缭绕的灯光，它的门敞开着，很诱人。它看起来漫不经心，好像它是为公众使用的；所以，一进门，我做的第一件事就是被门廊里的一个烟灰盒绊倒了。哈！我心想，哈，飞扬的颗粒差点让我窒息，这些灰烬是来自那座被毁坏的城市蛾摩拉吗？但是“交叉鱼叉”和“剑鱼？”——这一定是“陷阱”的标志。然而，我站起来，听到里面响亮的声音，推开第二扇内门。
    </p>
    <p>
      似乎是伟大的黑人议会坐在托菲特。一百张黑脸排成一排转身凝视；远处，一位黑色的厄运天使正在讲坛上敲打一本书。那是一座黑人教堂；传教士的文字是关于黑暗的黑暗，以及那里的哭泣、哀号和咬牙切齿。哈，伊斯梅尔，我喃喃自语，退出，“陷阱！”的招牌下的可悲娱乐。
    </p>
    <p>
      继续前行，我终于来到离码头不远的昏暗灯光下，听到空气中凄凉的吱吱声；抬头一看，门上挂着一个摆动的招牌，上面有一幅白色的画，隐隐约约地代表着一团高高笔直的雾状水柱，下面写着几个字——“Spouter Inn：——Peter Coffin。”
    </p>
    <p>
       Coffin？——Spouter？——我想，在那个特定的联系中相当不祥，但这是南塔基特的一个常见名字，他们说，我想这里的这个彼得是从那里移民的。因为光线看起来如此昏暗，而这个地方，在当时，看起来很安静，破旧的小木屋本身看起来好像是从某个被烧毁的地区的废墟中运到这里的，因为摆动的标志有一个穷困潦倒的那种吱吱声，我认为这里是廉价住宿和最好的豌豆咖啡的最佳地点。
    </p>
    <p>
      这是一个古怪的地方——一座山墙尽头的老房子，一侧似乎瘫痪了，悲伤地俯下身子。它站在一个尖锐的荒凉角落，那里狂风大作 Euroclydon 对可怜的保罗被抛掷的飞船发出比以往任何时候都更糟糕的嚎叫。然而，Euroclydon 对室内的任何人来说都是一股令人愉快的西风，他的脚放在炉子上安静地烤着睡觉。 “在判断那场名为 Euroclydon 的暴风时，”一位老作家说——我拥有他的作品现存的唯一副本——“它会产生惊人的差异，无论你是从玻璃窗向外看，那里的玻璃上全是霜在外面，或者你是从那扇没有窗框的窗户观察它，两边都是霜，只有死神是唯一的玻璃窗。”真的，我想，当我想到这段话时——老黑字，你说得很好。是的，这双眼睛就是窗户，而我的这个身体就是房子。可惜他们没有堵住缝隙和缝隙，并在各处塞上一点棉绒。但现在进行任何改进都为时已晚。宇宙完了；拱石已打开，木屑在一百万年前运走。可怜的拉撒路在那里，他的枕头在路边石上牙齿格格作响，颤抖着抖落身上的破烂，他可能会用破布塞住双耳，把玉米芯放进嘴里，但这并不能阻止狂暴的欧洲克里顿。欧洲克莱顿！老戴夫斯说，穿着他的红色丝质外衣——（后来他换了一件更红的）呸，呸！多么美好的霜夜；猎户座如何闪闪发光；什么北极光！让他们谈论他们永恒温室的东方夏季气候；给我用自己的煤炭打造属于我自己的夏天的特权。
    </p>
    <p>
      但是拉撒路是怎么想的呢？他能把蓝色的双手举到壮丽的北极光下取暖吗？难道拉撒路宁愿呆在苏门答腊也不愿呆在这里吗？他岂不是宁愿把他沿着赤道线纵向躺下吗？是的，你们这些神！自己下到火坑里，以防霜冻？
    </p>
    <p>
      现在，Lazarus 被困在 Dives 门前的路边石上，这比一座冰山停泊在摩鹿加群岛上更美妙。然而戴夫自己，他也像沙皇一样生活在冰冷的叹息组成的冰宫中，作为节制协会的主席，他只喝孤儿温热的泪水。
    </p>
    <p>
      但是现在不要再哭泣了，我们要去捕鲸了，还有很多事情要做。让我们把结冰的脚上的冰刮掉，看看这个“Spouter”可能是个什么样的地方。

      第 3 章 Spouter-Inn。
    </h2>
    <p>
      进入山墙尽头的 Spouter-Inn，您会发现自己处在一个宽阔、低矮、杂乱无章的入口处，里面有老式的壁板，让人想起一些废弃的旧工艺的堡垒之一。一侧挂着一幅非常大的油画，如此彻底地被熏黑了，每一面都被污损了，以至于你在不均匀的交叉光下观看它，只能通过勤奋的研究和一系列系统的访问，以及对邻居的仔细询问，您可以通过任何方式了解其目的。如此大量的阴影和阴影，起初你几乎以为是新英格兰女巫时代某个雄心勃勃的年轻艺术家，曾试图描绘出令人着迷的混乱。但经过大量认真的思考和反复思考，尤其是推开入口后方的小窗，你终于得出结论：这样的想法，无论多么疯狂，也并非完全没有根据。
    </p>
    <p>
      但最让你感到困惑和困惑的是一团长长的、柔软的、不祥的、黑色的东西，它盘旋在画面的中央，三条蓝色、暗淡、垂直的线条漂浮在一种无名的酵母中。真是一幅沼泽、湿漉漉、黏糊糊的画面，足以让一个紧张的人分心。然而，它是否有一种不确定的、半实现的、难以想象的崇高使你完全被它冻结，直到你不由自主地对自己发誓要找出那幅奇妙的画的含义。时不时地，一个明亮的，但是，唉，欺骗性的想法会带你通过。-这是午夜狂风中的黑海。-这是四种原始元素的不自然的战斗。-这是一个被毁坏的荒地。-这是一个Hyperborean的冬季场景.-这是冰封的时间流的破裂。但最后，所有这些幻想都屈从于画面中那不祥之物。
      <i>
        那个
      </i>
      一旦发现，其他的就都明白了。但是停下来；它不是有点像一条巨大的鱼吗？甚至是伟大的利维坦本人？
    </p>
    <p>
      事实上，艺术家的设计似乎是这样的：我自己的最终理论，部分基于与我就该主题交谈过的许多老年人的综合意见。这幅画描绘了一场大飓风中的霍纳角；半沉的船在那儿颠簸，只剩下三根被拆掉的桅杆。一条愤怒的鲸鱼正打算从船上一跃而下，正做出巨大的动作，将自己刺穿在三个桅杆顶上。
    </p>
    <p>
      这个入口对面的墙上到处挂着一排异教徒般的巨大棍棒和长矛。有的密密麻麻地镶着闪闪发光的牙齿，像象牙锯；其他人则簇拥着人类的头发结。一个是镰刀形的，有一个巨大的手柄，像长臂割草机在新割的草地上割出的刀一样。当你凝视时，你不寒而栗，想知道什么可怕的食人者和野蛮人会用这样一个骇人听闻的骇人工具进行死亡收割。与这些混在一起的是生锈的旧捕鲸矛和鱼叉，它们都破损变形了。有些是传说中的武器。五十年前，内森·斯温 (Nathan Swain) 用这支曾经很长的长矛，现在弯成肘部，在日出和日落之间杀死了十五头鲸鱼。那个鱼叉——现在就像一个开瓶器一样——被扔进了爪哇海，被一头鲸鱼带走，多年后在布兰科角被杀死。原来的铁进入了尾巴附近，就像一根不安分的针寄居在人的身体里，走了整整四十英尺，最后被发现嵌入了驼峰。
    </p>
    <p>
      穿过这个昏暗的入口，继续穿过那条低矮的拱形小路——穿过过去一定是一个巨大的中央烟囱，周围环绕着壁炉——你就进入了公共休息室。这是一个更昏暗的地方，上面的横梁很低很重，下面的木板很旧，起皱了，你几乎会幻想自己踩到了一些旧船的驾驶舱，尤其是在这样一个嚎叫的夜晚，当这艘锚定在角落的旧方舟剧烈摇晃时.一侧放着一张长长的、低矮的、像架子一样的桌子，上面摆满了裂开的玻璃柜，里面摆满了从这个广阔世界最偏远的角落收集来的尘土飞扬的稀有物品。从房间更远的角度投射出一个看起来很黑的巢穴——酒吧——这是对露脊鲸头部的粗鲁尝试。不管怎样，鲸鱼下颚巨大的拱形骨矗立在那里，如此之宽，几乎可以在它下面行驶一辆马车。里面是破旧的架子，周围摆满了旧的细颈瓶、瓶子、烧瓶；在那些迅速毁灭的大嘴里，就像另一个被诅咒的约拿（他们确实用这个名字称呼他）一样，一个瘦小的老人忙碌着，他为了钱，高价出卖水手们的精神错乱和死亡。
    </p>
    <p>
      可恶的是他倒毒药的玻璃杯。虽然真正的圆柱体内外兼修，但恶毒的绿色护目镜欺骗性地向下逐渐变细到一个欺骗性的底部。平行的经脉粗暴地啄入玻璃，围绕着这些脚垫的高脚杯。填满
      <i>
        这个
      </i>
      标记，您只需支付一分钱；多给
      <i>
        这个
      </i>
      一分钱；依此类推到满杯——合恩角量杯，你可以一先令一饮而尽。
    </p>
    <p>
      进入这个地方后，我发现许多年轻的海员聚集在一张桌子旁，在昏暗的灯光下检查着
      <i>
        skrimshander
      </i>
      的标本。我去找房东，告诉他我想住一个房间，得到的回答是他的房子已经满了——不是空着的床。 “不过，”他补充说，敲了敲他的额头，“你不反对共用标枪手的毯子，是吗？我猜你要去捕鲸，所以你最好习惯这种事情。”
    </p>
    <p>
      我告诉他我从来不喜欢两个人​​睡一张床；如果我要这样做，那将取决于标枪手是谁，如果他（房东）真的没有其他地方可以容纳我，而且标枪手也不是绝对令人反感的，为什么不在一个陌生的地方走得更远些呢？在如此凄凉的夜晚，我愿意忍受任何体面人的半条毯子。
    </p>
    <p>
       “我是这么想的。好的;请坐。晚饭？——你想吃晚饭吗？晚饭马上就做好了。”
    </p>
    <p>
      我坐在一张旧木凳上，上面雕刻得像炮台上的长凳。在一端，一个沉思的焦油还在用他的折叠刀进一步装饰它，弯下腰，勤奋地清理他两腿之间的空间。他在一艘满帆的船上试手，但我想他并没有取得太大进展。
    </p>
    <p>
      最后，我们大约有四五个人被叫到隔壁房间吃饭。和冰岛一样冷——一点火也没有——房东说他买不起。除了两支暗淡的牛脂蜡烛外，什么都没有，每支都在缠绕的床单中。我们费力地扣好猴子外套的扣子，用半冻的手指将几杯滚烫的茶捧到唇边。但食物是最丰盛的——不仅有肉和土豆，还有饺子；我的妈呀！晚餐吃饺子！一个身穿绿色方格大衣的小伙子，以一种极其可怕的方式对着这些饺子自言自语。
    </p>
    <p>
       “我的孩子，”房东说，“你会做一个死去的撒丁人的噩梦。”
    </p>
    <p>
       “房东，”我小声说，“那不是标枪手吗？”
    </p>
    <p>
       “哦，不，”他说，看起来有点像恶魔般的滑稽，“标枪手是个黑皮肤的家伙。他从不吃饺子，他不吃——他只吃牛排，而且他喜欢吃生一点的。”
    </p>
    <p>
       “真他妈的厉害，”我说，“那个标枪手在哪儿？他在这里吗？”
    </p>
    <p>
       “他很快就会到这里来，”这是回答。
    </p>
    <p>
      我忍不住，开始对这个“黑皮肤”的标枪手产生了怀疑。无论如何，我下定决心，如果真要我们一起睡，他必须比我先脱衣服上床睡觉。
    </p>
    <p>
      吃完晚饭，大家又回到了酒吧间，当时我不知道自己还能做什么，于是决定在晚上剩下的时间里当个旁观者。
    </p>
    <p>
      不久，外面传来骚动的声音。启动时，房东喊道：“那是鲸鲸号的船员。我今天早上播种了她的报道；三年的航程，一艘满载的船。万岁，孩子们；现在我们将获得 Feegees 的最新消息。”
    </p>
    <p>
      入口处传来海靴的踩踏声；门被猛地打开，一群疯狂的水手滚了进来。他们穿着毛茸茸的值班服，头上裹着羊毛被子，衣衫褴褛，衣衫褴褛，胡须结冰，看上去就像拉布拉多的熊。他们刚从船上下来，这是他们进入的第一所房子。难怪他们直奔鲸鱼的嘴巴——酒吧——当满脸皱纹的小老乔纳在那里主持时，很快就把他们倒满了。一个人抱怨他得了重感冒，约拿给他调了一种类似沥青的杜松子酒和糖蜜药剂，他发誓这是治疗所有感冒和粘膜炎的绝妙药方，不管时间长短，也不管感冒了拉布拉多海岸，或冰岛的天气一侧。

      酒很快就灌进了他们的脑袋，即使是刚从海上登陆的最勇敢的船长也是如此，他们开始最顽固地蹦蹦跳跳。
    </p>
    <p>
      然而，我观察到其中一个人有点冷漠，虽然他似乎不想用自己冷静的表情破坏船员们的欢乐，但总的来说，他没有像其他人那样大声喧哗。这个人立刻引起了我的兴趣；既然海神命定他很快就会成为我的船友（尽管就这个故事而言，他只是一个沉睡的伙伴），我将在这里冒险对他做一些简单的描述。他站起来足足有六英尺高，肩膀高贵，胸膛像一个围堰。我很少在男人身上看到过这样的肌肉。他的脸被烧焦了，呈深褐色，洁白的牙齿在反差下显得格外耀眼。而在他深邃的眼影中，漂浮着一些似乎并没有给他带来多少快乐的回忆。他的声音立刻表明他是南方人，而且从他优美的身材来看，我认为他一定是来自弗吉尼亚阿勒根山脊的高大登山者之一。当他的同伴们的狂欢达到顶峰时，这个人悄悄溜走了，我再也没有见过他，直到他成为我在海上的伙伴。然而，几分钟后，他的船员们就想念他了，而且，由于某种原因，他们似乎非常喜欢他，他们发出了“Bulkington！布尔金顿！布尔金顿在哪儿？冲出屋去追他。

    <p>
       It was now about nine o&#39;clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
       No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. I don&#39;t know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
    </p>
    <p>
       The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord! I&#39;ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan&#39;t sleep with him. I&#39;ll try the bench here.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Just as you please; I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it&#39;s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I&#39;ve got a carpenter&#39;s plane there in the bar—wait, I say, and I&#39;ll make ye snug enough.” So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven&#39;s sake to quit—the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
       I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.
    </p>
    <p>
       The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn&#39;t I steal a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
    </p>
    <p>
       Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person&#39;s bed, I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I&#39;ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long. I&#39;ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there&#39;s no telling.
    </p>
    <p>
       But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o&#39;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
       The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he answered, “generally he&#39;s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to rise—yes, he&#39;s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don&#39;t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can&#39;t sell his head.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Can&#39;t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “That&#39;s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn&#39;t sell it here, the market&#39;s overstocked.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “With what?” shouted I.
    </p>
    <p>
       “With heads to be sure; ain&#39;t there too many heads in the world?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you&#39;d better stop spinning that yarn to me—I&#39;m not green.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther guess you&#39;ll be done 
      <i>
        brown
      </i>
       if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin&#39; his head.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I&#39;ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord&#39;s.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It&#39;s broke a&#39;ready,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Broke,” said I—“ 
      <i>
        broke
      </i>
       , do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sartain, and that&#39;s the very reason he can&#39;t sell it, I guess.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I&#39;ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, 
      <i>
        you
      </i>
       I mean, landlord, 
      <i>
        you
      </i>
       , sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that&#39;s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin&#39; you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of &#39;balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he&#39;s sold all on &#39;em but one, and that one he&#39;s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow&#39;s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin&#39; human heads about the streets when folks is goin&#39; to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin&#39; out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.”
    </p>
    <p>
       This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “He pays reg&#39;lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it&#39;s getting dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes—it&#39;s a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There&#39;s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it&#39;s an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn&#39;t do. Come along here, I&#39;ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it&#39;s Sunday—you won&#39;t see that harpooneer to-night; he&#39;s come to anchor somewhere—come along then; 
      <i>
        do
      </i>
       come; 
      <i>
        won&#39;t
      </i>
       ye come?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
       “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman&#39;s bag, containing the harpooneer&#39;s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
       But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
       I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer&#39;s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
       Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag&#39;s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes, it&#39;s just as I thought, he&#39;s a terrible bedfellow; he&#39;s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It&#39;s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun&#39;s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
       Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years&#39; War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!
    </p>
    <p>
       But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days&#39; old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
    </p>
    <p>
       I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
       All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.
    </p>
    <p>
       But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
    </p>
    <p>
       Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.” And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord, for God&#39;s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Don&#39;t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn&#39;t harm a hair of your head.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn&#39;t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I thought ye know&#39;d it;—didn&#39;t I tell ye, he was a peddlin&#39; heads around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
       “You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What&#39;s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself—the man&#39;s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don&#39;t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It&#39;s dangerous. Besides, I ain&#39;t insured.”
    </p>
    <p>
       This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to say—“I won&#39;t touch a leg of ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
    </p>
    <p>
       I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
