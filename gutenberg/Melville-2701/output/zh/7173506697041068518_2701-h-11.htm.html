      第 53 章 Gam。
    </h2>
    <p>
      亚哈没有登上我们所说的捕鲸船的表面原因是：风和海预示着暴风雨。但即使情况并非如此，从他随后在类似场合的行为来看，他也许终究不会登上她——如果是这样的话，他在打招呼的过程中得到了否定的回答他提出的问题。因为，正如最终证明的那样，他不想与任何陌生船长交往，哪怕只有五分钟，除非他可以提供一些他如此全神贯注地寻找的信息。但是，所有这一切可能仍未得到充分估计，如果不是这里谈到捕鲸船在外国海域相遇时的特殊用法，尤其是在共同的巡航场上。
    </p>
    <p>
      如果两个陌生人穿越纽约州的松树贫瘠之地，或者同样荒凉的英国索尔兹伯里平原；若是在这样荒凉的荒野中不经意地相遇，他们这辈子都免不了要互相行礼。停下来交换消息；也许，一起坐下来休息一会儿：那么，在一望无际的松树贫瘠之地和大海的索尔兹伯里平原上，两艘捕鲸船在地球的尽头——在孤零零的范宁岛附近——相互凝视，这要自然得多，或者遥远的King&#39;s Mills；更自然的是，我说，在这种情况下，这些船只不仅应该互相冰雹，而且还应该进行更密切、更友好和善于交际的接触。尤其是在同一个海港拥有的船只的情况下，这似乎是理所当然的事情，而且这些船只的船长、高级船员和不少船员都是彼此认识的；因此，有各种亲爱的家庭事务可以谈论。
    </p>
    <p>
      对于长期离开的船，外向边界的人，也许船上有信件；无论如何，她一定会让她在模糊不清、用拇指磨损的档案中保留一些日期比最后一份晚一两年的文件。作为对这种礼貌的回报，外出的船只将从她注定要前往的巡航场收到最新的捕鲸情报，这对她来说是最重要的事情。在某种程度上，所有这一切都适用于捕鲸船在巡航场本身穿过彼此航迹的情况，即使它们离开家园的时间同样长。因为他们中的一个可能收到了来自第三艘现在很远的船只的转交信件；其中一些信件可能是写给她现在遇到的船上的人的。此外，他们还会交换捕鲸的消息，并进行愉快的交谈。因为他们不仅会得到水手们的所有同情，而且还会因为共同的追求和共同分担的困难和危险而产生的所有奇特的意气相投。
    </p>
    <p>
      国家的不同也不会有任何非常本质的区别；也就是说，只要双方都说一种语言，就像美国人和英语一样。虽然，可以肯定的是，对于少数英国捕鲸者来说，这样的会面并不经常发生，而且当它们真的发生时，他们之间很容易出现某种害羞；因为你的英国人相当拘谨，而你的美国佬，除了他自己，他不喜欢任何人有这种品质。此外，英国捕鲸者有时会对美国捕鲸者产生一种大都市的优越感；将瘦长的楠塔基特人和他难以描述的地方主义视为一种海农。但是，英国捕鲸人的这种优势真正存在于何处，很难说，因为洋基队在一天内捕杀的鲸鱼总和比所有英国人在十年内捕杀的鲸鱼还要多。但这是英国捕鲸者的一个无害的小弱点，楠塔基特人并不在意；可能吧，因为他知道自己也有一些弱点。
    </p>
    <p>
      因此，我们看到，在所有单独航行的船只中，捕鲸者最有理由与人交往——他们确实如此。鉴于，一些商船在大西洋中部彼此尾流交汇，时常会在没有任何识别词的情况下通过，在公海上相互切割，就像百老汇的一对花花公子；并且可能一直沉迷于对彼此的钻机进行最终批评。至于战舰，当他们有机会在海上相遇时，他们首先会经历一连串愚蠢的鞠躬和刮擦，对少尉的回避，似乎没有多少诚恳的善意和兄弟般的爱。就像触碰的奴隶船相遇，为什么，他们如此匆忙，他们尽快逃离对方。至于海盗，当他们碰巧碰到彼此的交叉骨头时，第一声冰雹是——“多少头骨？”——就像捕鲸者冰雹一样——“多少桶？”而这个问题一旦得到回答，海盗们就会立即避而远之，因为他们双方都是地狱般的恶棍，不喜欢看到彼此有太多的恶棍相似之处。
    </p>
    <p>
      但看看这个虔诚、诚实、朴实、好客、善于交际、洒脱的捕鲸人！当捕鲸者在任何合适的天气遇到另一个捕鲸者时会做什么？她有一个“ 
      <i>
        Gam
      </i>
       ”，这是所有其他船只都完全不知道的东西，他们甚至从未听说过这个名字；如果他们偶然听到它，他们只会咧嘴一笑，并重复诸如“喷子”和“沸腾器”之类的有趣的词，例如漂亮的感叹词。为什么所有商船海员，所有海盗和战舰的船员，以及奴隶船的水手，都对鲸船怀有如此轻蔑的感觉；这是一个很难回答的问题。因为，比如说，就海盗而言，我想知道他们的这个职业是否有什么特别的荣耀。确实，它有时会以不寻常的高度结束；但只是在绞刑架上。此外，当一个人以那种奇怪的方式被提升时，他就没有适当的基础来支持他的高高在上。因此，我的结论是，海盗吹嘘自己比捕鲸人高高在上，这种说法没有坚实的基础。
    </p>
    <p>
      但什么是
      <i>
        Gam？
      </i>
      您可能会用食指在字典的各栏上上下移动，而永远找不到单词。约翰逊博士从未达到那种博学。诺亚·韦伯斯特的方舟没有容纳它。然而，这个同样的表达词多年来一直在大约一万五千名真正出生的洋基队中使用。当然，它需要一个定义，并且应该被纳入 Lexicon。有了这个观点，让我有学问地定义它。

        ，通常在巡航场上；当他们互相欢呼之后，船员们互访：两位船长暂时留在一艘船上，两位大副留在另一艘船上。
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      还有一个关于 Gamming 的小项目在这里不能忘记。所有职业都有自己的细节特点。捕鲸业也是如此。在海盗船、战船或奴隶船上，当船长在他的船上被划到任何地方时，他总是坐在船尾床单上舒适的、有时有软垫的座位上，并且经常用一个漂亮的小女帽舵柄为自己掌舵用快乐的绳索和丝带装饰。但是捕鲸船的尾部没有座位，也没有那种沙发，也根本没有舵柄。如果捕鲸船长像患痛风的老市政官坐在专利椅子上那样，在水面上四处走动，确实是个好时光。至于舵手，捕鲸船决不允许有任何这样的女性气质；因此，就像在赌博中，一艘完整的船的船员必须离开船，因此，由于船长或标枪手是人数众多，因此下属是舵手，船长没有地方坐下，被拉走了到他的访问都像一棵松树一样站着。通常你会注意到，意识到整个可见世界的目光都从两艘船的两侧落在他身上，这位站立的船长都意识到通过保持双腿来维持尊严的重要性。这也不是一件容易的事；因为在他的后方是巨大的伸出的舵桨不时地打在他的后背上，后桨通过敲打他的膝盖来往复运动。因此，他前后完全被卡住，只能通过伸展的双腿安顿下来，向侧面伸展自己；但是船突然猛烈的颠簸往往会把他掀翻，因为如果没有相应的宽度，基础的长度就什么都不是。仅仅把两根杆子做一个展开角，是立不起来的。然后，再一次，它永远不会在全世界的目光中出现，我说，它永远不会让这个跨骑的船长看到他用手抓住任何东西来稳定自己最细微的颗粒；的确，作为他整个、活泼的自我控制的象征，他通常把手放在裤子的口袋里；但也许他的手一般都很大很重，所以他把它们抬到那里作为压舱物。尽管如此，还是发生了这样的事例，也是经过充分验证的事例，船长在一两个异常关键的时刻，在突然的狂风中说——抓住最近的桨手的头发，像严酷的死亡一样死死地抓住。

      第 54 章 Town-Ho 的故事。

      说完 Goney 后不久，又遇到了另一位回家的捕鲸人 Town-Ho*。她几乎完全由波利尼西亚人驾驶。在随后的简短游戏中，她给了我们关于白鲸记的重要消息。对一些人来说，现在对白鲸的普遍兴趣因 Town-Ho 故事的一个情节而疯狂地提高了，这个故事似乎模糊地与鲸鱼有关，这是对所谓的上帝审判之一的某种奇妙的、倒转的造访。说要超过一些人。后一种情况，以其自身特殊的伴随，构成了即将讲述的悲剧的秘密部分，从来没有传到亚哈船长或他的副手的耳朵里。因为故事的秘密部分连 Town-Ho 号的船长本人都不知道。这是那艘船上三名同盟白人海员的私人财产，其中一人似乎根据罗马的保密禁令将其传达给了塔什泰戈，但第二天晚上塔什泰戈在睡梦中胡言乱语，并以这种方式透露了很多，当他被唤醒时，他无法很好地拒绝休息。然而，这件事对 Pequod 的那些水手产生了如此强大的影响，他们充分了解了这件事，并以如此奇怪的微妙方式称呼它，如果他们在这件事上受到约束，他们会保守秘密他们自己所以它永远不会在 Pequod 的主桅杆后面发生。将这条黑暗的线索与船上公开讲述的故事在适当的位置交织在一起，我现在着手将这起奇怪的事情全部记录下来。

      为了我的幽默，我将保留我曾经在利马向一群闲逛的西班牙朋友讲述它的风格，一个圣人的前夜，在黄金旅馆铺着厚镀金瓷砖的广场上抽烟。在那些优秀的骑士中，年轻的唐斯佩德罗和塞巴斯蒂安与我的关系更为密切。因此，他们偶尔会提出中间问题，并在当时得到适当的回答。
    </p>
    <p>
       “在我第一次了解到我要向你们排练的事件之前大约两年，先生们，楠塔基特岛的抹香鲸 Town-Ho 正在你们这里​​的太平洋巡航，从这个海域的屋檐向东航行没多少天好黄金客栈。她在界线以北的某个地方。一天早上，根据日常使用情况，在操作泵后，观察到她在船舱内抽出的水比平常多。先生们，他们猜是剑鱼刺伤了她。但是船长有一些不寻常的理由相信在那些纬度地区等待着他的是难得的好运；因此，他们非常不愿意离开他们，当时认为泄漏一点也不危险，尽管事实上，他们在相当恶劣的天气下尽可能低地搜索货舱后找不到它，但船仍然继续巡航, 船员在水泵旁工作的时间间隔宽且容易；但没有好运降临；又过了几天，泄漏不仅没有被发现，而且明显增加了。如此之多，以至于现在船长有些惊慌，全速航行，远离岛屿中最近的港口，在那里把他的船体拖出去修理。
    </p>
    <p>
       “虽然她面前没有小通道，但是，如果有最常见的机会，他一点也不担心他的船会在途中沉没，因为他的水泵是最好的，并且定期更换它们，那六个 -而且——他的三十个人可以轻而易举地保住这艘船；没关系如果泄漏应该加倍在她身上。事实上，几乎整个航道都被非常旺盛的微风吹拂着，如果不是拉德尼的野蛮霸道，Town-Ho 号几乎可以肯定地安全抵达她的港口，没有发生最小的死亡事件，伴侣，葡萄园人，以及来自布法罗的湖人和亡命之徒 Steelkilt 的激烈报复。
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘莱克曼！——布法罗！请问，什么是湖人，布法罗在哪里？唐·塞巴斯蒂安说，从他摇摆的草席上站起来。
    </p>
    <p>
       “在我们伊利湖的东岸，唐；但是——我渴望你的礼貌——也许，你很快就会听到更多关于这一切的消息。现在，先生们，乘坐方帆双桅帆船和三桅帆船，几乎和从你们的老卡亚俄航行到遥远的马尼拉的任何船只一样大和坚固；这位位于美国内陆腹地的莱克曼 (Lakeman) 尚未受到所有那些普遍与公海联系在一起的农业掠夺印象的熏陶。因为在它们交汇的集合体中，我们这些巨大的淡水海——伊利海、安大略海、休伦海、苏必利尔海和密歇根海——拥有海洋般的广阔，具有许多海洋最崇高的特征；有许多不同的种族和气候。它们包含浪漫岛屿的圆形群岛，就像波利尼西亚水域一样；在很大程度上，由两个截然不同的国家作为支撑，就像大西洋一样；他们提供了从东方到我们众多领土殖民地的长途海上通道，散布在他们的银行周围；到处都是炮台，以及高大的麦基诺山羊般崎岖的大炮。他们听到了海军胜利的雷鸣般的舰队；每隔一段时间，他们就会把自己的海滩让给野蛮人，野蛮人的红脸从破旧的棚屋中闪现出来。因为里格和里格的两侧是古老而未被涉足的森林，枯瘦的松树矗立在那里，就像哥特式家谱中排列整齐的国王；那些栖息着野生非洲猛兽和丝绸动物的森林，它们出口的毛皮为鞑靼皇帝提供了长袍；它们反映了布法罗和克利夫兰的铺砌首都，以及温尼贝戈村庄；他们像装备齐全的商船、国家的武装巡洋舰、轮船和山毛榉独木舟一样漂浮。他们被北风和摧毁桅杆的风暴席卷，就像任何鞭打咸水的海浪一样可怕。他们知道沉船是什么，因为在看不见陆地的地方，无论多么内陆，他们已经淹没了许多午夜的船和所有尖叫的船员。因此，先生们，虽然是内陆人，但 Steelkilt 是在狂野的海洋中诞生的，并且在狂野的海洋中得到养育；和任何人一样勇敢的水手。而对于拉德尼来说，虽然在他还是婴儿的时候，他可能已经把他放在孤独的楠塔基特海滩上，在他母亲的大海中哺乳；尽管在死后他一直追随着我们严峻的大西洋和你们沉思的太平洋；然而，他是否像偏远地区的海员一样充满报复心和社会争吵，刚从鹿角处理的鲍伊刀的纬度中走出来。然而，这个楠塔基特人是不是一个有一些好心的人？而这个莱克曼，一个水手，虽然确实是个恶魔，但可能会通过坚定的坚定态度，只有被人类认可的普遍体面所缓和，这是最卑鄙的奴隶的权利；如此对待，这条钢裙一直保持着无害和温顺的状态。无论如何，到目前为止他已经证明了这一点；但是拉德尼注定要发疯，还有斯蒂尔基尔特——但是，先生们，你们会听到的。
    </p>
    <p>
       “最远不超过一两天，在她的船头指向她的岛屿避风港后，Town-Ho 的泄漏似乎再次增加，但只是为了每天需要一个小时或更长时间在泵上。你必须知道，在像我们的大西洋这样的稳定​​和文明的海洋中，例如，一些船长很少考虑整个过程。尽管是一个寂静、沉睡的夜晚，如果甲板上的军官碰巧忘记了他在这方面的职责，他和他的船员们很可能永远不会再记得这件事，因为所有的手都轻轻地沉到了水底。先生们，在远离你们向西的孤独而野蛮的海域，即使是在相当长的航程中，船只也会齐声齐鸣地敲打它们的水泵手柄，这也不是完全不寻常的；也就是说，如果它位于可以容忍到达的海岸线上，或者是否为他们提供了任何其他合理的撤退。只有当一艘漏水的船只位于那些水域的某个非常偏僻的地方，一些真正没有陆地的纬度时，她的船长才开始感到有点焦虑。
    </p>
    <p>
       “Town-Ho 就是这样；因此，当她的泄漏再次被发现时，她的几位同事确实表现出一些小担忧；尤其是 Radney the mate。他命令将上层帆很好地悬挂起来，重新铺好帆布，并向微风张开。现在这个拉德尼，我猜想，他一点也不胆小，一点也不倾向于对接触他自己的人产生任何神经质的恐惧，就像你们可以轻易想象的陆地或海上的任何无所畏惧、不假思索的生物一样，先生们。因此，当他表现出对船舶安全的这种担忧时，一些海员宣称这只是因为他是这艘船的部分所有者。所以当他们那天晚上在水泵处工作时，当他们站立时，他们的脚不断地被碧波荡漾的清水淹没，这头上有不小的游戏机在他们中间狡猾地进行着；先生们，像任何山泉一样清澈——从泵中冒出的气泡流过甲板，并在背风处的排水孔处以稳定的喷口倾泻而出。
    </p>
    <p>
       “现在，正如你所知，在我们这个传统的世界中，这种情况并不少见——无论是水域还是其他地方；当一个指挥他的同胞的人发现他们中的一个人在男子气概的普遍自豪感上非常明显地优于他时，他会直接对那个人怀有无法克服的厌恶和痛苦；如果他有机会，他会推倒并粉碎那位副官的塔楼，把它变成一小堆灰尘。不管我的想法如何，先生们，无论如何，Steelkilt 是一种高大而高贵的动物，有着罗马人的脑袋，飘逸的金色胡须就像你们最后一位总督的喷鼻战马的流苏外壳；如果他是查理曼大帝父亲的儿子，先生们，他的大脑、心脏和灵魂造就了查理曼大帝钢裙。但是大副拉德尼丑得像头骡子。但同样顽强、固执、恶毒。他不爱 Steelkilt，Steelkilt 知道这一点。
    </p>
    <p>
       “当大副和其他人一起在水泵旁辛勤工作时，他发现大副靠近了，湖人假装没有注意到他，但毫不畏惧，继续他快乐的玩笑。
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘是的，是的，我快乐的小伙子们，这是一个活泼的漏洞；拿着一个cannikin，你们中的一个，让我们尝一尝。上帝保佑，值得装瓶！我告诉你们，伙计们，老拉德的投资一定要成功！他最好切掉属于他的那部分船体，然后把它拖回家。事实是，孩子们，剑鱼才刚刚开始工作；他又回来了，带着一帮船匠、锯鱼和锉鱼等等；他们的整个团队现在都在努力工作，在底部进行切割和削减；做出改进，我想。如果老拉德现在在这儿，我会叫他跳下船去散开他们。他们在拿他的财产开玩笑，我可以告诉他。但他是个单纯的老灵魂——拉德，而且还是个美人。伙计们，他们说他其余的财产都投资在了镜子上。我想知道他是否愿意把鼻子模型送给像我这样的可怜虫。
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘该死的你的眼睛！什么是泵停止？拉德尼吼道，假装没有听到水手们的谈话。 “打雷！”
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘是的，是的，先生，’Steelkilt 说，像一只蟋蟀一样快活。 “活泼，孩子们，活泼，现在！”随之而来的是，水泵像五十辆消防车一样叮当作响；男人们向它脱帽致敬，不久就听到了肺部特有的喘息声，这表明生命中的最大能量达到了最充分的紧张状态。
    </p>
    <p>
       “最后，湖人和他的其他人一起停止了水泵，气喘吁吁地向前走去，然后自己坐在绞车上；他的脸火红，双眼充血，擦着额头上的大汗。先生们，拉德尼究竟是怎样一个骗人的恶魔，竟敢去管这样一个处于肉体激怒状态的人，我不知道；但事情就这样发生了。大副忍不住在甲板上大步走着，吩咐他拿把扫帚扫下木板，还有一把铲子，把一些让猪乱跑而引起的讨厌的东西清除掉。
    </p>
    <p>
       “现在，先生们，在海上清扫船的甲板是一件家务活，除了狂风之外，每天晚上都有人照管；众所周知，在当时实际沉没的船只的情况下会这样做。先生们，这就是海上使用的僵化和海员对整洁的本能热爱；有些人不先洗脸是不会甘愿淹死的。但在所有船只中，如果船上有男孩，扫帚业务是男孩的规定范围。此外，镇河里的强壮男人被分成了几个帮派，轮流在水泵边工作；作为他们中最健壮的海员，斯蒂尔基尔特经常被指派为其中一个帮派的船长。因此，他本应摆脱与真正的航海职责无关的任何琐碎事务，他的同志们就是这种情况。我提到所有这些细节，以便您可以确切地了解这件事是如何发生在这两个人之间的。
    </p>
    <p>
       “但不仅如此：关于铲子的命令几乎同样明显是为了刺痛和侮辱斯蒂尔基尔特，就好像拉德尼朝他脸上吐口水一样。任何在捕鲸船上当过水手的人都会明白这一点；所有这一切，毫无疑问还有更多，当大副说出他的命令时，湖人完全理解了。但当他静静地坐了一会儿，坚定地注视着大副凶狠的眼睛，发现他体内堆积着成堆的火药桶，慢火柴静静地向他们燃烧着；当他本能地看到这一切时，那种奇怪的忍耐和不愿意激起任何本已愤怒的人更深的激情——这种反感最能感受到，当真正勇敢的人真正感受到时，即使在受屈时——这种无名的幻觉，先生们，偷走了在 Steelkilt 之上。
    </p>
    <p>
       “所以，他平淡无奇的语气中，只是因为身体暂时的疲惫而有些心碎，回答他说扫地不关他的事，他不会去做。然后，他根本没有提到铲子，而是指着三个小伙子作为习惯的清扫工；谁，没有在水泵上宿营，一整天几乎没有做任何事情。对此，拉德尼发誓回应，霸道至极，无条件重申命令；与此同时，莱克曼举着一把从附近的木桶里抢来的制桶锤，朝仍然坐着的莱克曼走去。
    </p>
    <p>
       “由于他在水泵上痉挛性的辛劳，他感到既激动又恼火，尽管他第一次产生了无法形容的忍耐感，但汗流浃背的钢裙却无法容忍大副的这种忍耐；但不知何故，他仍然抑制着内心的火焰，一言不发，顽强地固定在座位上，直到最后被激怒的拉德尼在离他脸几英寸的地方摇动了锤子，愤怒地命令他执行他的命令。
    </p>
    <p>
       Steelkilt 升起，绕着绞盘慢慢后退，大副拿着威胁性的锤子稳稳地跟在后面，故意重复他不服从的意图。然而，看到他的忍耐没有丝毫效果，他用扭曲的手发出了一个可怕的、无法形容的暗示，警告这个愚蠢而痴情的人。但这是徒劳的。就这样，两人慢慢地绕着绞车转了一圈。当他终于决定不再撤退时，想到他现在已经尽可能地克制自己的幽默，莱克曼在舱口停了下来，这样对军官说：
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;先生。拉德尼，我不会服从你的。把那把锤子拿开，或者看看你自己。但是命中注定的伴侣离他更近了，湖人站在那里，现在把沉重的锤子摇到离他牙齿一英寸的地方；同时重复一连串难以忍受的咒骂。不退千分之一寸； Steelkilt 用他毫不畏缩的短刀刺向他的眼睛，在他身后握紧右手并慢慢地将其缩回，告诉迫害他的人，如果锤子只是擦过他的脸颊，他（Steelkilt）就会杀死他。但是，先生们，这个傻瓜已经被打上了被众神屠杀的烙印。锤子立即碰到了脸颊；下一刻，大副的下巴就在他的脑袋里燃烧起来。他倒在舱门上，像鲸鱼一样喷着血。
    </p>
    <p>
       Steelkilt 船尾的呼喊声还没有过去，他就在摇晃一根直通高处的支柱，他的两个战友站在桅杆顶上。他们都是运河人。
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘运河者！’唐佩德罗叫道。 “我们在港口见过许多捕鲸船，但从未听说过你们的运河船。对不起：他们是谁？他们是什么？
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘运河者，唐，是属于我们大伊利运河的船夫。你一定听说过它。
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘不，先生；在这片沉闷、温暖、最懒惰和世袭的土地上，我们对你们充满活力的北方知之甚少。
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘是吗？那么，唐，给我倒满杯子。你的 chicha 很好喝；在继续之前，我会告诉你们我们的运河者是什么人；因为这些信息可能会对我的故事有所帮助。
    </p>
    <p>
       “先生们，三百六十英里，穿越整个纽约州；穿过无数人口稠密的城市和最繁荣的村庄；穿过长长的、凄凉的、无人居住的沼泽，以及肥沃的耕地，肥沃无可匹敌；通过台球室和酒吧室；穿过大森林的至圣所；在印度河上的罗马拱门上；穿过阳光和阴影；快乐的心或破碎的心；穿过那些高贵的莫霍克县所有对比鲜明的风景；特别是，在一排排雪白的小教堂旁，尖顶几乎像里程碑一样矗立着，源源不断地流淌着威尼斯腐败的、经常无法无天的生活。先生们，这是你们真正的 Ashantee；你的异教徒在那里嚎叫；你在哪里找到他们，就在你隔壁；在长长的阴影下，在教堂舒适的光顾下。因为一些奇怪的命运，正如人们经常注意到你们的大都市的掠夺者，他们总是在司法大厅周围安营扎寨，所以罪人，先生们，大多数人都在最神圣的地方。
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘那是修士路过吗？’唐佩德罗说，低头看着拥挤的广场，带着幽默的关切。
    </p>
    <p>
       “‘好吧，对于我们的北方朋友，伊莎贝拉夫人在利马的宗教裁判所衰落了，’唐·塞巴斯蒂安笑道。 “继续，先生。”
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;片刻！赦免！&#39;另一个公司的人喊道。 “以我们所有利米人的名义，我只想向您表达，水手先生，我们绝没有忽视您在腐败的比较中没有用现在的利马代替遥远的威尼斯的微妙之处。哦！不要低头，看起来很惊讶；你知道沿岸流传着一句谚语——“腐败如利马”。它也证实了你的话；教堂比台球桌还多，而且永远开放——而且“像利马一样腐败”。威尼斯也是如此。我去过那里;有福的福音传道者圣马可的圣城！多米尼克，清除它！你的杯子！谢谢：我在这里补充；现在，你又倒出来了。

       “先生们，以他自己的职业自由描绘，运河者将成为一个优秀的戏剧英雄，他是如此丰富和如画般的邪恶。像马克·安东尼一样，他日复一日地沿着他的绿色草坪、鲜花盛开的尼罗河漂流，公开地戏弄着他红润的脸颊的克利奥帕特拉，在阳光明媚的甲板上让他那杏色的大腿成熟起来。但在岸上，所有这些女性气质都破灭了。 Canaller 如此自豪地炫耀的强盗伪装；他那顶松垮垮的、饰有华丽缎带的帽子彰显了他的高贵面容。对他漂流而过的村庄的微笑天真感到恐惧；他那黝黑的面容和大胆的招摇在城市中并非无人能及。我曾经是他自己运河上的流浪者，其中一位运河者给我带来了好转；我由衷地感谢他；不会忘恩负义；但这通常是你的暴力之人的主要救赎品质之一，有时他会用僵硬的手臂支持身处困境的贫穷陌生人，就像掠夺富人一样。总而言之，先生们，这种运河生活的狂野，由此得到了有力的证明；我们的野生捕鲸业包含如此多的最优秀的毕业生，而且除了悉尼人之外，几乎没有任何人类种族如此受到我们捕鲸船长的不信任。这一点也丝毫没有减少这件事的好奇心，对于我们沿线出生的成千上万的农村男孩和年轻人来说，大运河的试用期生活提供了唯一的过渡，可以让他们在基督教的玉米田里安静地收割，鲁莽地耕种最野蛮的海域。

    </p>
    <p>
       “我离开了，先生们，Lakeman 摇动后拉索的地方。他几乎没有这样做，当他被三个小副和四个标枪手包围时，他们都把他挤到了甲板上。 But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm&#39;s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Come out of that, ye pirates!&#39; roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. &#39;Come out of that, ye cut-throats!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt&#39;s) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?&#39; demanded their ringleader.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!&#39; and he once more raised a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Sink the ship?&#39; cried Steelkilt. &#39;Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say ye, men?&#39; turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.
    </p>
    <p>
       “The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—&#39;It&#39;s not our fault; we didn&#39;t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy&#39;s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw; ain&#39;t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don&#39;t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we&#39;re your men; but we won&#39;t be flogged.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Look ye, now,&#39; cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, &#39;there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the cruise, d&#39;ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don&#39;t want a row; it&#39;s not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won&#39;t be flogged.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Turn to!&#39; roared the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—&#39;I tell you what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won&#39;t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don&#39;t do a hand&#39;s turn.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I&#39;ll keep ye there till ye&#39;re sick of it. Down ye go.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Shall we?&#39; cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
       “As the Lakeman&#39;s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
       “All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
       “At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Better turn to, now?&#39; said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Shut us up again, will ye!&#39; cried Steelkilt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Oh certainly,&#39; said the Captain, and the key clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. &#39;Damn ye,&#39; cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, &#39;the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the whole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;But as for you, ye carrion rogues,&#39; turning to the three men in the rigging—&#39;for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;&#39; and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;My wrist is sprained with ye!&#39; he cried, at last; &#39;but there is still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn&#39;t give up. Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss, &#39;What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I murder you!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me&#39;—and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Best not,&#39; hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;But I must,&#39;—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, &#39;I won&#39;t do it—let him go—cut him down: d&#39;ye hear?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about 
      <i>
        his
      </i>
       being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;You are a coward!&#39; hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;So I am, but take that.&#39; The mate was in the very act of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt&#39;s threat, whatever that might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew. Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the ship&#39;s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt&#39;s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate&#39;s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
       “During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship&#39;s side. In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o&#39;clock, in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;What are you making there?&#39; said a shipmate.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;What do you think? what does it look like?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Like a lanyard for your bag; but it&#39;s an odd one, seems to me.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Yes, rather oddish,&#39; said the Lakeman, holding it at arm&#39;s length before him; &#39;but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven&#39;t enough twine,—have you any?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “But there was none in the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Then I must get some from old Rad;&#39; and he rose to go aft.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;You don&#39;t mean to go a begging to 
      <i>
        him!
      </i>
       &#39; said a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Why not? Do you think he won&#39;t do me a turn, when it&#39;s to help himself in the end, shipmate?&#39; and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman&#39;s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman&#39;s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, &#39;There she rolls! there she rolls!&#39; Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Moby Dick!&#39; cried Don Sebastian; &#39;St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but that would be too long a story.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;How? how?&#39; cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more into the air, Sirs.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;The chicha! the chicha!&#39; cried Don Pedro; &#39;our vigorous friend looks faint;—fill up his empty glass!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. &#39;The White Whale—the White Whale!&#39; was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate&#39;s got the start; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale&#39;s topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale&#39;s slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Meantime, at the first tap of the boat&#39;s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney&#39;s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary place—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
       “The ship&#39;s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
       “On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;What do you want of me?&#39; cried the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?&#39; demanded Steelkilt; &#39;no lies.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;I am bound to Tahiti for more men.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.&#39; With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;A pretty scholar,&#39; laughed the Lakeman. &#39;Adios, Senor!&#39; and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him. * * * *

    <p>
       “&#39;Are you through?&#39; said Don Sebastian, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;I am, Don.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem to press.&#39;

       “&#39;Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don Sebastian&#39;s suit,&#39; cried the company, with exceeding interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Nay,&#39; said Don Sebastian; &#39;but I know a worthy priest near by, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this may grow too serious.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,&#39; said one of the company to another; &#39;I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can.&#39;
    </p>
    <p>

       “&#39;This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,&#39; said Don Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
    </p>
    <p>
       “&#39;So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye, gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.&#39;”
