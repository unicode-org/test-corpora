       Çapelden “Spouter-Inn” -e gaýdyp gelip, ol ýerde Kwegeni ýeke tapdym; birneme wagt bäri kapelladan çykypdy. Otdan öň skameýkada, aýaklaryny peç ojagyna alyp, bir eli bilen kiçijik negro butyny ýüzüne ýakyn tutýardy; ýüzüne gaty göz aýlady we pyçak bilen burnuna ýuwaşja siňip gitdi, şol bir wagtyň özünde-de butparazlyk bilen özüni diňledi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nowöne indi kesildi, şekili goýdy; basym stoluň başyna geçip, ol ýerde uly kitap alyp, gujagyna goýup, sahypalary bilgeşleýin sanap başlady; her elli sahypada, janköýerlik edişim ýaly, bir salym duruzmak, töweregine boş seretmek we uzyn çekilen geň galdyryjy sesi eşitdirmek. Soňra indiki elli ýaşynda ýene başlar; elli-den köp sanap bilmeýän ýaly, her gezek birinji ýerde başlaýan ýaly bolup, diňe elli sany adamyň bilelikde tapylmagy bilen, köp sahypada haýran galmagy tolgundyryldy.
    </p>
    <p>
       Köp gyzyklanma bilen oňa syn edip oturdym. Sawage bolsa-da, iň bolmanda meniň pikirimçe, ýüzi hakda gizlinlikde ýüz öwürdi, ýüzünde henizem ylalaşmaýan bir zat bardy. Ruhy gizläp bilmersiň. Hishli çekilmedik tatuirovkalarynda, ýönekeý dogruçyl ýüregiň yzlaryny gördüm öýdüpdim; ullakan, çuň gözlerinde, otly gara we batyrgaýlykda müň şeýtana het edip biljek ruhuň nyşanlary görünýärdi. Bularyň hemmesinden başga-da butparazlar hakda belli bir belentlik bardy, hatda agzybirligi hem maýyp bolup bilmedi. Ol hiç wagt aglamadyk we hiç wagt krediti bolmadyk adama meňzeýärdi. Kellesiniň syrylmagy, maňlaýy has erkin we has ýeňil görnüşde çekilendigi ýa-da beýlekilerden has giň görünýändigi bilen baglanyşykly, men karar bermek islemeýärin; ýöne onuň kellesiniň frenologiki taýdan ajaýypdygy belli. Bu gülkünç ýaly bolup görünmegi mümkin, ýöne maňa meşhur Waşingtonda görşi ýaly general Waşingtonyň kellesini ýada saldy. Gaşlaryň ýokarsyndan birmeňzeş yzygiderli tertipleşdirilen yza çekiş eňňidi, üstünde gaty galyň agaçly iki sany uzyn çyzgy ýaly gaty proýektli. Kweýk Jorj Waşington kannibalistik taýdan ösdi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Şeýdip, ony ýakyndan gözden geçirip otyrkam, ýarym tüweleýden tüweleýe seredýän ýaly bolup, meniň barlygyma gulak asmady, ýekeje gezek-de özüni biynjalyk etmedi; ýöne ajaýyp kitabyň sahypalaryny sanamak bilen meşgullandy. Öňki gije nädip bile bile ýatanymyzy we esasanam irden turanymda üstüme atylan mähirli golumy göz öňünde tutup, bu biperwaýlygy gaty geň hasapladym. Emma wagşylar geň jandarlar; käwagt olary nädip almalydygyny bilmeýärsiňiz. Ilki bilen çakdanaşa çaklaýarlar; ýönekeýligiň asuda öz-özüňi ýygnamagy Sokrat paýhasy ýaly bolup görünýär. Şeýle hem, Kwegiň myhmanhanadaky beýleki deňizçiler bilen asla birleşmändigini ýa-da gaty azdygyny gördüm. Ol hiç zat etmedi; tanyşlarynyň töweregini giňeltmek islemeýän ýalydy. Bularyň hemmesi meni gaty täsin galdyrdy; Şeýle-de bolsa, ikinji pikirleriň üstünde ajaýyp bir zat bardy. Ine, öýden ýigrimi müň kilometr uzaklykda, Keýp Hornyň ýoly bilen, ýagny ol ýere barmagyň ýeke-täk ýoly - upupiter planetasyndaky ýaly geň adamlar arasynda atyldy; şonda-da ol özüni rahat duýýardy; iň rahatlygy goramak; öz ýoldaşlygy bilen mazmun; elmydama özüne deňdir. Elbetde, bu ajaýyp filosofiýa degdi; munuň ýaly zadyň bardygyny hiç haçan eşitmändigi şübhesiz. Trueöne, belki, hakyky filosof bolmak üçin, adamlar beýle ýaşamakdan ýa-da beýle yhlas etmekden habarsyz bolmaly däldiris. Şeýle ýa-da beýle adamyň filosof üçin özüni berýändigini eşiden badyma, dispeptiki garry aýal ýaly, “siňdirijisini döwen bolmaly” diýen netijä geldim.
    </p>
    <p>
       Häzir şol ýalňyz otagda otyrkam; pes ýanýan ot, şol ýumşak döwürde, ilkinji intensiwligi howany gyzdyrandan soň, diňe seretmek üçin ýalpyldaýar; agşamky kölegeler we hyýallar meýdançalaryň töweregine ýygnanýar we bize sessiz, ýeke-täk ekiz seredýär; dabaraly çişmezden joşýan tupan; Geň duýgulary duýup başladym. Içimde ereýänini duýdum. Indi ýarylan ýüregim we däli elim möjek dünýäsine öwrülmedi. Bu köşeşdiriji wagşy ony yzyna satyn aldy. Ol ýerde medeniyetli ikiýüzliligiň we gödek aldawyň ýok tebigatyny gürleýän gaty biperwaýlygy bilen oturdy. Wildabanydy; görmek üçin ajaýyp ýerler; şonda-da özümi syrly özüne çekip başlandygymy duýup başladym. Beýlekileriň köpüsini yza çekjek şol bir zatlar, meni özüne çeken magnitlerdi. Men butparaz dosty synap görerin, sebäbi hristianlaryň hoşniýetliligi subut edildi, ýöne boş sypaýçylyk. Oturgyjymy onuň ýanyna çekdim we dostlukly alamatlar we yşaratlar etdim, şol wagt onuň bilen gürleşmek üçin elimden gelenini etdim. Ilki bilen bu öňegidişliklere az üns berdi; ýöne häzirki wagtda, soňky gijeki myhmansöýerligi barada aýdanymda, ol ýene-de ýatjakdygymyzy ýa-da däldigimizi sorady. Men oňa hawa diýdim. Men onuň göwnünden turandyr öýdüpdim, belki birneme öwgüli.
    </p>
    <p>
       Soňra kitaby bilelikde geçirdik we oňa çap etmegiň maksadyny we içindäki birnäçe suratyň manysyny düşündirmäge synanyşdym. Şeýdip, tiz wagtdan onuň gyzyklanmasyny çekdim; şondan soň bu meşhur şäherde görüljek dürli daşarky gözel ýerler hakda mümkin boldugyça iň gowy zatlary aýtmaga gitdik. Tizara sosial tüsse teklip etdim; sumkasyny we tomahawk öndürip, ýuwaşlyk bilen maňa bir çemçe hödürledi. Soň bolsa, şol ýabany turbadan çeňňek çalşyp, aramyzda yzygiderli geçip oturdyk.
    </p>
    <p>
       Butparazlaryň döşünde maňa henizem biperwaýlyk bar bolsa, bu ýakymly, hakyky tüsse, tiz wagtdan ony çykardy we bize märekäni galdyrdy. Ol maňa edil özi ýaly tebigy we gadagan edilýärdi; tüssämiz gutaransoň, maňlaýyny meniň üstüme basdy, bilime gysdy we mundan beýläk öýlendigimizi aýtdy; ýurdunyň sözlerinde biziň ýakyn dostlarymyzdygyny aňladýar; zerur bolsa, meniň üçin şatlyk bilen ölerdi. Bir watandaşda bu duýdansyz dostluk alawy gaty ir, gaty ynamsyz bir zat ýalydy; ýöne bu ýönekeý wagşyçylykda şol köne düzgünler ulanylmazdy.
    </p>
    <p>
       Agşamlyk naharyndan we başga bir sosial söhbetdeşlikden we çilimden soň bilelikde otagymyza gitdik. Maňa salnan kellesini sowgat etdi; ullakan temmäki gapjygyny çykardy we temmäkiniň aşagyndan tutup, otuz dollar kümüş çykardy; soň olary stoluň üstünde ýaýradyp, mehaniki taýdan iki deň bölege bölüp, birini maňa tarap itekledi we meniňkidigini aýtdy. Men remont etjek boldum; emma olary jübimiň jübüsine guýup, meni dymdy. Men olara galmaga rugsat berdim. Soň bolsa agşam namazyny okady, butyny çykardy we kagyz tagtasyny aýyrdy. Käbir alamatlar we alamatlar bilen, meniň oňa goşulmagymy alada goýýan ýaly hasapladym; ýöne näme etmelidigimi gowy bilip, meni çagyrsa, ýerine ýetirerinmi ýa-da başga bir zat diýip pikir etdim.
    </p>
    <p>
       Men gowy mesihi boldum; ýalňyş Presbiterian buthanasynyň gursagynda doguldy we ulaldy. Onda nädip bu ýabany butparaz bilen agaç böleklerine ybadat edip bilerin? Emma ybadat näme? pikir etdim. Indi Ysmaýyl, asmanyň we ýeriň ajaýyp Hudaýy - butparazlar we olaryň hemmesi, gara agaçdan azajyk gabanjaň bolup biler öýdýärsiňizmi? Mümkin däl! Worshipöne ybadat näme? Hudaýyň islegini ýerine ýetirmek 
      <i>
        - bu
      </i>
       ybadat. Taňrynyň islegi näme? —Diýip, ýoldaşymyň maňa näme etmegini islese, 
      <i>
        bu
      </i>
       Hudaýyň islegi. Indi Kwegeg meniň ýoldaşym. Bu Queequegiň maňa näme etmegini isleýärin? Näme üçin, presbiterian ybadat görnüşinde meniň bilen birleşiň. Netijede, men onuň bilen birleşmeli; ergo, butparazlyga öwrülmeli. Şeýdip, saçlary ýakdym; bigünä kiçijik buty wagyz etmäge kömek etdi; oňa Queequeg bilen ýakylan biskwiti teklip etdi; öňünde iki gezek ýa-da üç gezek salam; burnundan ogşady; şeýdip, eşiklerimizi çykardyk we öz wyciencesdanymyz we bütin dünýä bilen rahatlykda ýatdyk. Emma azajyk söhbetdeşlik etmän uklamaga gitmedik.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nädip bilemok; ýöne dostlaryň arasynda gizlin maglumat bermek üçin düşek ýaly ýer ýok. Erkek bilen aýaly, ruhlarynyň düýbüni birek-birege açýarlar diýýärler; käbir köne jübütler köplenç ýalan sözleýärler we daň atýança köne wagtlarda gürleşýärler. Şeýlelik bilen, ýüregimiziň bal toýunda, men we Kwegek rahat, söýgüli jübüt ýatdyk.

       Şeýdip, düşekde ýatdyk, söhbetdeş bolduk we gysga wagtyň içinde ukladyk, Kwegeg bolsa häzir goňur reňkli aýaklaryny mähir bilen zyňyp, soň bolsa yza çekdik; şonuň üçin bütinleý ýakyn we erkin we aňsat bolduk; ahyrsoňy, gapma-garşylygymyz sebäpli, içimizdäki kiçijik nägilelik düýbünden aýrylanda, dynç günleri entek belli bir derejede bolsa-da, täzeden turjak ýaly bolduk.
    </p>
    <p>
       Hawa, gaty oýandyk; şeýle bir köp welin, biziň ýagdaýymyz halys ösüp başlady we az-kem oturyp gördük; egin-eşiklerimiz, dört dyzymyzy bir-birine ýakynlaşdyryp, baş tagtanyň üstünde egilip, dyzlarymyz gyzýan ýaly, iki burnumyz olaryň üstünde egilýär. Gapydan gaty salkyn bolany üçin, özümizi gaty gowy duýýardyk; hakykatdanam otagda ýangynyň ýokdugyny görüp, düşek eşiklerinden. Galyberse-de, aýdýaryn, sebäbi beden ýylylygyndan lezzet almak üçin, käbir bölekleriňiz sowuk bolmaly, sebäbi bu dünýäde diňe tersine däl hil ýok. Hiç zat ýok. Özüňizi rahat hasaplaýarsyňyz we uzak wagtlap ýaşasaňyz, mundan beýläk rahat diýip bolmaz. Queöne düşekde Kweek we meniň ýaly burnuňyzyň ujy ýa-da kelläňiziň täji birneme sowadylan bolsa, näme üçin hakykatdanam umumy düşünjede özüňizi iň ýakymly we aç-açan ýyly duýýarsyňyz? Şol sebäpden, baýlaryň kaşaň oňaýsyzlyklaryndan biri bolan ýatýan jaý hiç wagt ot bilen üpjün edilmeli däldir. Bu hili lezzetiň beýikligi üçin siziň araňyzdaky ýorgan we daş howanyň sowuklygyndan başga zat ýok. Soň bolsa, arktika kristalynyň ýüregindäki bir ýyly uçgun ýaly ýatarsyňyz.

       Birnäçe wagtdan bäri gözümi açaryn öýdüp, bu oturgyçda otyrdyk; Sebäbi düşekleriň arasynda, gündizine ýa-da gijesi bolsun, uklap ýa-da ukudan bolsun, düşekde bolmagyň has köp ünsüni jemlemek üçin elmydama gözümi ýummak usuly bar. Sebäbi gözüni ýummakdan başga hiç kim öz şahsyýetini dogry duýup bilmez; garaňkylyk hakykatdanam öz eserlerimiziň dogry elementi ýaly, ýagtylyk palçykdan has dogabitdi. Şondan soň gözümi açanymdan we öz ýakymly we öz-özüm döreden garaňkylygymdan gije sagat on iki ýagtylandyrylmadyk garaňky garaňkylyga çykanymdan soň, ylalaşmaýan ýigrenç duýdum. Şeýle-de, Kwegegiň şeýle giň oýanandygymyzy görüp, çyrany ýakmagyň iň gowusydygy baradaky pikire asla garşy çykmadym; Mundan başga-da, Tomahawk-dan birneme ümsüm bolmak isleýärdi. Öňem bir gije düşekde çilim çekmegine şeýle bir ýigrenç duýsam-da, söýgi bir gezek egilmek üçin gelende, berk düşünjelerimiziň näderejede ösýändigini görüň. Häzirlikçe, Kweýegiň hatda düşekde-de çilim çekmeginden gowy zat halamokdym, sebäbi ol şol wagt öý rahatlygyndan doly ýalydy. Indi öý eýesiniň ätiýaçlandyryş polisi üçin bikanun alada etmedim. Diňe hakyky dostum bilen turba we ýorgan paýlaşmagyň gizlin rahatlygy üçin diri boldum. Egnimize çekilen köýnekli penjeklerimiz bilen, indi Tomahawk-dan beýlekisine geçdik, ýuwaş-ýuwaşdan üstümizdäki täze çyranyň alawy bilen yşyklandyrylan gök asylan tüsse synagy ösýänçä.
    </p>
    <p>
       Bu synagdan geçirýän synagçynyň wagşylygy uzak sahnalara öwürendigi ýa-da ýokdugyny bilemok, ýöne indi dogduk adasy hakda gürledi; Taryhyny eşitmek isläp, ondan dowam etmegini haýyş etdim. Ol şatlyk bilen boýun egdi. Şol wagt men onuň sözleriniň birnäçesine düşünmedim, ýöne soňraky aýan etmeler, onuň döwülen frazeologiýasy bilen has tanyş bolanymdan soň, maňa berlen hekaýany diňe skeletde subut edip biljek ýaly görkezmäge mümkinçilik berýär.

       Haçan-da täze bir wagşy wagşy ot tokaýlygynda ot-çöplerde ýabany ylgaýar, yzyndan gök öwüsýän ýaly süýrenýän geçiler; şonda-da, Kwegegiň hyjuwly kalbynda, bir ýa-da iki sany hristian dünýäsinden has köp zady görmek islegi döräpdi. Kakasy ýokary başlyk, patyşa; daýysy baş ruhany; ene tarapynda bolsa ýeňip bolmajak söweşijileriň aýaly bolan daýzalary bilen öwündi. Wena damarlarynda ajaýyp gan bardy - şa zatlary; Gynansak-da, terbiýelenmedik ýaşlygynda iýmitlenýän kanibil tizliginden gorkýaryn.

Emma deňizçilerden doly goşundy bolan gämi kostýumyndan ýüz öwürdi; kakasynyň täsiriniň hemmesi agdyklyk edip bilmezdi. Emma Kwegeg kasam etdi. Gämide ýeke özi, adadan çykanda gäminiň hökman geçmelidigini bilýän uzak bogazyna çykdy. Bir tarapynda merjen gaýasy bardy; beýleki tarapdan, suwda ösen mangrove gyrymsy agaçlary bilen örtülen pes dil. Gämisini henizem ýüzüp ýören gämi duralgalarynyň arasynda, deňiz kenary bilen gizläp, yzky eli bilen aşakda oturdy; gämi ýalpyldawuk ýaly süýşüp barýarka; tarapyny tutdy; aýagynyň bir yza galyp, gämisini gark etdi; zynjyrlara çykdy; palubanyň üstünde özüni doly zyňdy-da, ýüzügi gysdy-da, bölek-bölek edilse-de goýbermezlige kasam etdi.

       Kapitan biderek ýere gaçjakdygyny aýdyp haýbat atdy; ýalaňaç bileklerinden kesilen aýnany asdy; Kwegek bir patyşanyň oglydy, Kwegeg bolsa boýun egmedi. Umytsyz aladasyzlygy we hristian dünýäsine baryp görmek isleginden haýran galan kapitan ahyrsoňy razy boldy we özüni öýünde edip biljekdigini aýtdy. Emma bu ajaýyp ýaş wagşy - Uelsiň bu deňiz şazadasy kapitanyň kabinasyny hiç wagt görmedi. Ony deňizçileriň arasynda goýdular we deňizçi ýasadylar. Emma Patyşa Piter ýaly, daşary ýurt şäherleriniň gämi abatlaýyş kärhanalarynda zähmet çekmäge razy bolşy ýaly, Kwegeg bilimsiz watandaşlaryny ýagtylandyrmak güýjüne begenip bilse, hiç hili masgaraçylykly görünmedi.

       Tigir arabasyny karz aldyk we zatlarymyza, şol sanda öz garyp haly haltamy we Kweýegiň kanwas haltasyny we hamamyny alyp başladyk, gämi duralgasynda kiçijik Nantucket paket şoneri “Moss” -a gitdik.

Muňa jogap hökmünde, meniň aýdanlarymyň dogrydygyna garamazdan, öz garponyna aýratyn bir söýgüsiniň bardygyny, sebäbi kepillendirilen zatlardan bolany üçin, köp ölümli söweşde gowy synanyşyk edilendigi we ýürekler bilen çuňňur ýakynlaşandygyny aýtdy. kitleriň Gysgaça aýdylanda, öz taýaklary bilen ýaraglanan daýhanlaryň çemenliklerine girýän köp sanly içerki orakçylar we otlaýjylar ýaly, olary üpjün etmäge hiç hili borçly bolmasa-da, Kwegek öz şahsy sebäpleri bilen öz garpunyny gowy görýärdi.

       Çeňňegi elimden onuň eline geçirip, maňa gören ilkinji tigir arabasy hakda gülkünç bir hekaýa gürrüň berdi. Sag Harborda. Gäminiň eýeleri, agyr döşüni internat öýüne äkitmek üçin oňa karz beren bolsa gerek. Bu zatdan bihabar ýaly görünmeli däl, hakykatda ol düýbünden şeýle bolsa-da, oky dolandyrmagyň takyk usuly barada - Kwegeg döşüni oňa goýýar; çalt urýar; soň bolsa çeňňegi egnine alyp, duralga çykýar. “Näme üçin?” Diýdim, “Kwegek, sen ondan has gowy bilýän bolsaň, biri pikir eder. Adamlar gülmedimi? &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Şondan soň maňa başga bir hekaýa gürrüň berdi. Rokowoko adasynyň ýaşaýjylary, toý dabaralarynda ýaş kokosyň hoşboý ysly suwuny pyçak ýaly uly reňkli kalaba öwürýärler; we bu çeňňek elmydama toý tutulýan örülen düşekde ajaýyp merkezi bezegi emele getirýär. Indi belli bir uly söwda gämisi Rokowokoda degdi we onuň serkerdesi, ähli maglumatlardan çen tutsaň, iň bolmanda deňiz kapitany üçin bu serkerde Kýukegiň aýal doganynyň toý dabarasyna çagyryldy, owadan ýaş şa gyzy on Bolýar; toý myhmanlarynyň hemmesi gelniň bambuk kottejine ýygnananlarynda, bu kapitan içeri girýär we hormat wezipesine bellenilip, özüni puşmanyň garşysyna goýdy, baş ruhany bilen belent mertebesi Patyşa Kwegegiň kakasy arasynda.

Bir gapdalynda, New Bedford köçeleriň eýwanlarynda ýokary galdy, buz bilen örtülen agaçlary arassa, sowuk howada ýalpyldaýardy. Gämi duralgalarynda ullakan depeler we gaplar daglary üýşüpdir we dünýäde gezip ýören kit gämileri gapdalda dymyp, howpsuz ýagdaýda gark bolupdyr; beýlekilerden otlaryň we kärdeşleriň sesi eşidildi, garyşyk sesler we meýdançany eretmek üçin galp sesler eşidildi, hemmesi täze gezelençleriň başlanandygyny görkezýär; iň howply we uzak ýolagçylygyň diňe bir sekuntdan başlanýandygyny; ikinjisi gutardy, diňe üçünjisi başlaýar we ş.m., hemişelik we hemişelik.

       Şol köpük çüwdüriminde, Kwegeg meniň bilen içip, gaýnadylan ýalydy. Onuň garaňky burunlary ýaryldy; tabşyrylan we görkezilen dişlerini görkezdi. Biz uçduk; Moss partlama hormat goýdy; ördi we ýaýlaryny soltanyň öňünde gul hökmünde çümdürdi. Bir gapdala egilip, bir gapdala çykdyk; sim ýaly gygyrýan her bir ýüplük; gury tornadolarda hindi kanallary ýaly gümürtik iki uzyn maska. Bu joşgunly sahnadan şeýle bir doly bolduk welin, çümüp barýan ýaýyň ýanynda duranymyzda, iki ýoldaşyň şeýle ýoldaş bolmalydygyna haýran galan ýolagçylaryň gülkünç görnüşlerine üns bermedik; ak adam ak reňkli negrden has mertebeli zat ýalydy. Thereöne ol ýerde gaty gülkünç we gök öwüsýänler bardy, olar gaty ýaşyllygy bilen ähli ösümlikleriň ýüreginden we merkezinden gelen bolmaly. Kwegek bu ýaş nahallaryň birini arkasyna meňzeýän tutdy. Gabygyň sagady geler öýdüpdim. Garpuny taşlap, batyrgaý wagşy ony gujagyna aldy we gudratly çaltlygy we güýji bilen ony ýokary asmana göterdi; Soňra somersetiň ortasyna birneme degip, ýoldaşlary aýaklaryna ýarylan öýkenleri bilen gondy, Kwegek bolsa oňa öwrülip, ​​tomahawk turbasyny ýakdy-da, maňa çişirmek üçin berdi.

       Justöne edil şeýle boldy, kapitanyň öz gözüni ýatdan çykarmagyň wagty geldi. Esasy ýelkenli abraýly dartyş howa sahypasyny böldi we ägirt uly gülläp ösmek indi palubanyň bir böleginden soň tutuşlygyna süpürildi. Kwegegiň gaty gödek işlän garyp ýoldaşy gark boldy; elleriň hemmesi howsala düşdi; galmak üçin bumdan aljak bolmak, däli ýalydy. Sagdan çepe we ýene-de yza gaýdyp, sagadyň bir gezekde diýen ýaly bolup, her pursat böleklere bölünjek ýalydy. Hiç zat edilmedi we hiç zat edip bolmajak ýalydy; palubada oturanlar ýaýlara tarap ylgadylar we möwç urýan kitiň aşaky eňegi ýaly bolup durdular. Bu aljyraňňylygyň arasynda Kwegeg ep-esli derejede dyzyna çökdi we gülläp ösýän ýoluň aşagynda süýrenip, ýüpi gysdy, berkitmeleriň bir ujuny berkitdi, soň beýlekisini lasso ýaly sokdy, ony depäniň töweregine tutdy. kellesini süpürip, indiki gapdalynda spar şeýle duzaga düşdi we hemmesi howpsuzdy.

Üç minut ýa-da ondanam köp wagtlap it ýaly ýüzüp, uzyn ellerini göni öňüne atdy we doňan köpük arkaly batyrgaý eginlerini açdy. Uly we şöhratly ýoldaşymy gördüm, ýöne halas boljak birini görmedim.

Birnäçe minutdan ýene ýerinden turdy, bir eli henizem urýardy, beýlekisi jansyz görnüşi süýräpdi. Gämi gysga wagtyň içinde olary alyp gitdi. Garyp kädi dikeldildi.

For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”

       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.

    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.

    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
