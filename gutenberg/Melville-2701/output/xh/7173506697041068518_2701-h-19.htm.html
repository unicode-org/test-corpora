       I-Whale ye-STBB&#39;s, ithengwe kakhulu, yayiziswa kakuhle kwicala likaPequeo kwaye apho bonke abo basikelweyo basebenza ngaphambili, bade badlula kwi-heidelbursh tun, okanye imeko.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngelixa abanye bexakekile kulo msebenzi wokugqibela, abanye babeqeshelwe ukuthwala iityhubhu ezinkulu, kwaphela nje zizaliswe sisidoda; Kwaye xa ifikile ixesha elifanelekileyo, esi sidoda sibi sasisebenzisa ngononophelo i-ere ukuya kwizame, apho i-Anok.
    </p>

       Yayipholile kwaye ikhutshiwe ukuya kwinqanaba elinje, ukuba, xa, kunye nabanye abaliqela, ndahlala phantsi ngaphambi kokuhlamba kuka-Istantine yaLo, ndafumanisa ukuba ndingazange ndigqitywe kwi-tumps, apha kwaye iqengqele kwinxalenye yolwelo. Yayiyishishini lethu ukuba likhulule ezi phunga zibuyele kwi-fluid. Umsebenzi omnandi kunye nongathandekiyo! Akumangalisi ukuba kwakudala ukuba isidoda sesi sidoda sasiyinto ethandwayo. Icace gca! I-sweetener enjalo! isithambisi esinjalo! I-molifier ethandekayo! Emva kokufumana izandla zam kwimizuzu embalwa, iminwe yam yaziva ngathi yi-Eels, kwaye yaqala, ngokungathi kunjalo, ukuya kwiNersine kwaye ispilentine.

       Njengoko bendihleli apho ndiselula, ndingena kwidesika; emva kokuzibhokoxa ekuphumeni okukrakra kwimpumbuke yomoya; phantsi kwesibhakabhaka esizolileyo esiluhlaza; Inqanawa eyayiphantsi kwenqanawa ye-intele, kwaye ihlambe ngasese; Xa ndandihlamba izandla zam phakathi kwabo bathambileyo, bethambile bezicubu ezingenantlonelo, beluphume ngeyure; Njengoko bephule kakhulu kwiminwe yam, bakhupha zonke izinto zabo, njengokuvuthwa ziidiliya zabo ngokupheleleyo iwayini yazo; Ndathi ndakrokrela ukuba ivumba elingenakuthelekiswa nanto, kunye nenyaniso, inene, ngathi ivumba lee-viores zasentwasahlobo; Ndiyakuxelela, ukuba okoko bendiphila njengakwimiphunga; Ndilibele konke malunga nesifungo sethu sothuso; Kwisifo esingabonakaliyo, ndahlamba izandla kunye nentliziyo yam yayo; Ndiphantse ndaqala ukuthenga inkolelo yaseParacelsan endala ukuba isidoda sibubuhle kakhulu ekukhuliseni ubushushu; Ngelixa ndihlamba kuloo bhafu, ndaziva ndikhululekile kubo bonke abaza kugula, okanye isicabuti, okanye ububi, nangaluphi na uhlobo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Clue! khama! khama! yonke intsasa; Ndanyibilikisa ukuba isidoda side ndiphantse ndanyibilika kuwo; Ndalicudisa loo dlozi de kwabakho impambano engaqhelekanga phezu kwam; ndaye ndazibona ndingena ndingaqondanga ndicinezele izandla zabasebenzi endisebenza nabo kuyo, ndiphazama izandla zabo kwiiglowubhu ezithambileyo. Olo lwando olunjalo, oluthandekayo, olunobuhlobo, imvakalelo yothando ikwenzile oku kukuthintela; ukuba ekugqibeleni ndandisoloko ndicinezela izandla zabo, kwaye ndijonge phezulu emehlweni abo ngeemvakalelo; kangaka nje, uthi, -oh! zihlobo zam ezithandekayo, kutheni kufuneka siphinde sixabise naziphi na ii-acerbities zentlalo, okanye sazi noburharha obungenamdla okanye umona! Yiza; Sula izandla ezijikeleze izandla; Hayi, sonke masibe bonke baxaka omnye komnye; Masicule ngokwabantu ngokubanzi elubisi kunye nesibanda sobubele.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngaba ndingaqhubeka ndinokuhlala ndikrokrela isidoda ngonaphakade! Okwangoku, ekubeni ngamava amaninzi ahlala ixesha elide, ndiqonda ukuba kuzo zonke iimeko kufuneka umntu ade asezantsi, okanye ubuncinci, ukutshintsha kwakhe okufudumeleyo; Ukungayibethe naphi na kwingqondo okanye i-fancy; kodwa kwinkosikazi, intliziyo, ibhedi, itafile, isali, indawo yomlilo, ilizwe; Ngoku ekubeni ndiyiqonda yonke le nto, ndikulungele ukukhulula i-oversedhan. Kwiingcinga zemibono yobusuku, ndabona imiqolo emide yeengelosi eParadesi, nganye inazandla zayo kwi-charmaceorti.

       Ngoku, ngelixa ufumanisa isidoda, kuya kuba njalo ukuba uthethe ngezinye izinto ze-Akin kuyo, kwishishini lokulungiselela umkhombe womkhomzana wezaliso.

       Kuqala kuvela ihashe elimhlophe, ibizelwe, efunyenwe ekuphelisweni kweentlanzi, nakwiinxalenye ezimbi zefwsi zakhe. Iqinile kunye nemisipha ejiyileyo-i-wad yezihlunu-kodwa isenayo ioli. Emva kokubanjwa kwasemkhonzeni, ihashe elimhlophe linqunyulwe kuqala kwiiblongs eziphathwayo eziya kwi-Minriver. Zijongeka ngathi ziibhloko ze-Berkshire Marble.

       I-plum-pudding ligama eligunyazisiweyo kwiinxalenye ezithile zenyama yenyama, apha kwaye apho inamathele kwingubo ye-blubber, kwaye idla ngokuthatha inxaxheba kwisidanga esibonakalayo. Kuyinto ehlaziyayo, inyani, intle ukuba ibone. Njengegama layo elizweni, sisityebi kakhulu, senziwe i-tint enobutyebi, i-mottled, enomhlaba oneqhayiya oqaqambileyo negolide, onamachaphaza amabala e-crats enzulu kunye nemfusa. Ziingqungqwa zerubhi, kwimifanekiso ye-citron. Ngaphandle kwesizathu, kunzima ukuzigcina kukutya. Ndiyavuma, ukuba nje ndiye ndaba emva kwesimanga sokuzama. Ingcambu into njengoko ndifanele ndithame ukufuduka kwithanga laseLouis Leuis Leuis Leis Le fes ye-Leuis inokuba ibule usuku lokuqala emva kwexesha le-venin, kwaye loo ntaba ye-venin kunye ne-viegram yezidiliya ze Ishampeyini.

       Kukho enye into, kunye nesinye, ejikisa ngeli xesha leshishini, kodwa endivakalelwa kukuba ndidideke kakhulu. Ibizwa ngokuba yi-slobgollion; Inkanuko yentsusa kunye ne-Whalemen, kwaye kunjalo, nangona kunjalo ubunjani bento. Yinto engekhoyo i-oozy oozy, intambo, uninzi olufumaneka rhoqo kwiityhubhu zesidoda, emva kokuqiniswa kwexesha elide, kunye nokulinganisa okulandelayo. Ndiyibambe ukuba ngowona mzimba unqabileyo, ovuthiweyo wetyala, ulungelelanisa.
    </p>
    <p>
       I-Gurry, ibizwa njalo, ligama elifanelekileyo ukuba lilungu lomnenga olungileyo, kodwa ngamanye amaxesha asetyenziswa ngokuloba abalobi besidoda. Ichonge ubumnyama, ubumnyama obuyikhupha umva umva weGreenland okanye ngasekunene umnenga, kwaye uninzi lwazo lugubungela iidesika zezo miphefumlo iphantsi ezizingela ukuba i-leviyatan ingenayo.

       AbaNippers. Ngqongqo eli Lizwi aliyomvelo kwisigama sikaWhale. Kodwa njengoko isetyenzisiwe yi-whalemen, iba njalo. I-naipper ye-whaleman ngumtya omfutshane wezinto ezinqwenelekayo ezinqunyanyiweyo ukusuka kwinxalenye yomsila weLeviyathan: Ihlala i-intshi ngobungqingqwa bayo. Ngomda wafuduka ecaleni kwe-oyile, esebenza njenge-squilgee yesikhumba; Kwaye ngenxa yamagama angaphambili, ngokungathi ngumlingo, ohambelana nayo yonke imphoso.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa ukuze ufunde konke ezi zinto ziphinde zenzeka kwakhona, eyona ndlela iphela ihla kwigumbi le-blubber, kwaye unentetho ende kunye namabanjwa ayo. Le ndawo ibikhe yakhankanywa ngaphambili njengendawo yokwamkela iziqwenga zengubo yengubo, xa yayikukuhlisela ivela emkhonweni. Xa kufika ixesha elifanelekileyo ukuba basike imixholo yalo, le ndlu yindawo yothusa kuzo zonke i-suros, ngakumbi ebusuku. Kwelinye icala, kukhanyiswe yi-terning rhabaxa, isithuba sishiywe sicace gca kubasebenzi. Ngokuqhelekileyo bahamba ngababini, -e-pike-kunye ne-gaffman kunye nomntu ogaxelweyo. I-whaling-pike iyafana nesixhobo sokukhwela se-frigate segama elifanayo. I-neff yinto efana nekhefu-hip. Nge-gaff yakhe, i-gaffman ixhoma kwiphepha lelabhula, kwaye izama ukuyibamba ukuba ingatyibiliki, njengoko inqanawa ihamba kwaye ijikeleza. Ngeli xesha, i-spade-indoda imi ephepheni ngokwayo, iyinyanzela ngokwakho kwiziqwenga ezinamahashe. Le spide ibukhali njengokuphumelela. Iinyawo ze-Spademan zingenasidima; into ame phezu kwayo maxa wambi iya kutyibilika ngokungenakuthintelwa imke kuye, njengesileyi. Ukuba uthe wanqumla enye yeenzwane zakhe, okanye omnye wabancedi bakhe, ngaba uya kumangaliswa kakhulu? Iinzwane zinqabile phakathi kwamagumbi egumbi elinamadoda.

       Ubuye wangena kwibhodi kwi-pequed kwi-cunture ethile yale mpahla yomsebenzi; Kwaye ukhe wahambahamba ngaphambili usondele kwi-Windlamass, uqinisekile ukuba ndingoyiki ngaphandle kokuthandabuza okuncinci, ubuya kubonile apho, ulele kude kwi-Lee Skupers. Hayi iqula elimangalisayo kwintloko enkulu yomnenga; Ayisiyo i-prodigy yemihlathi yakhe esezantsi yayo engaphantsi; hayi ummangaliso womsila wakhe wesiNgesi; Akukho nanye kwezi yayiza kukongamela ngayo, njengesiqingatha se-fimpses, -ngengulongo kuneKentuki emde, kwaye isondele yonyawo olusezantsi kwisiseko, i-jet-mnyama njenge-queeequequeueg. Kwaye inyani, kunjalo, Okanye, endaweni yoko, kwakudala, kwanje. Isithixo esinjengalonto ifumanekayo kwiGuses Geech Mahaging Makade kwelakwaYuda; nokunqula oku, ukumkani uAsa, unyana wakhe, wamtyhilela isithixo, wayitshisa, ngenxa yesadron, enesahluko se-15 sencwadi yokuqala yookumkani.

       Jonga umnyango wenqanawa, obizwa ngokuba yi-Menriver, othi ngoku, kwaye uncedwe ziindawo ezimbini, kwaye uxhasa kakhulu amagxalathi, agqogqele kangangokuba wayephethe i-grenadier ephethe i-grenadier ephethe i-grenadier ethwele i-grerade entsimini. Ukuyindisa kwi-Depcacance Deck, ngoku uqhubeka enesidima ukuba asuse i-pelt yayo emnyama, njengomzingeli waseAfrika kwi-pelt ye-boa. Oku kwenziwe ukuba iguqule i-PLTE ngaphakathi, njengomlenze wePantaloon; Inika ukolula okuhle, ke phantse ukuphelisa ububanzi bayo; Kwaye ekugqibeleni ixhonywe, isasazeke, ekuqhubeni, ukuba yome. Ixesha elide, liyasuswa; Xa ususa ezinye iinyawo ezintathu, kwisiphelo esigciniweyo, kwaye emva koko usika izilayidi ezimbini kwimingxunya engalo kwelinye icala, ubude bayo buyityelele emzimbeni. I-Municer ngoku imele ngaphambi kokuba utyale imali kwi-canonicals epheleleyo yobizo lwayo. Imemory kuyo yonke iodolo yakhe, olu kutya lutyalo lodwa luya kumkhusela ngokwaneleyo, ngelixa uqeshiwe kwimisebenzi engaqhelekanga yeofisi yakhe.

       Izama ukuzama ityalwe phakathi kwangaphambili kunye ne-mainmast, eyona ndawo inamagumbi anendawo yokuhlala. Amaplanga aphantsi kwamandla angaqhelekanga, angqinelwe ukuxhasa ubunzima be-bite eqinile ye-Brick kunye nodaka, iinyawo ezilishumi ngecala lesibhozo, kwaye ezintlanu ukuphakama. Isiseko asingeneli kwidesika, kodwa i-mandry ikhuselekile kumphezulu ngamadolo e-phunga inyibilikisi macala onke, kwaye isikhuhlane emacaleni. Kule nkqogi kugcinwa ngenkuni, kwaye phezulu igcwele ngokupheleleyo yi-therm, i-slow kunye ne-hattch ebiweyo. Ukususa le hatch siveza iimbiza ezinkulu zetry-try, ezimbini ngenani, kunye nomthamo wemiphanda emininzi. Xa ungasetyenziswanga, zigcinwe zicocekile kakhulu. Ngamanye amaxesha zikhazimliswa ngelitye lesepha kunye nesanti, de zibengezele ngaphakathi okwezitya zesilivere. Ngexesha lobusuku-iiwotshi ezindala zonqulo ezimnandi ziya kubakhaza kuzo kwaye zibandakanyeke kude kube nakwela. Ngoxa beqeshwa ekuzikhazimliseni—indoda enye embizeni nganye, ecaleni—unxibelelwano oluninzi oluyimfihlo luqhutywa, kwimilebe yentsimbi. Yindawo yokufumana ulwazi olubanzi lwemathematics. Kwakusesandleni sasekhohlo sizame imbiza ye-pequod, kunye nelitye lesodareyithi liye laxakalwa yinyani ebalaseleyo, ukuba kwi-geometri iphelele ecaleni kwe-cycloid, i-seapstone yam yomzekelo, iya kuhla nayiphi na inqaku ngeli xesha.

       Ukususa ibhodi yomlilo phambi kwezamazama, i-are masnery yelo cala ityhilwe, ingene imilomo yentsimbi ineentsimbi, ngokuthe ngqo phantsi kweembiza. Le milomo ifakwe kwiminyango enzima yentsimbi. Ubushushu obukhulu bomlilo kuthiwe bathintelwe ukuba bangaziboneleli kwidesika, ngokugcina indawo engekho mthethweni phantsi komgangatho wonke wemisebenzi. Ngumjelo ofakwe ngasemva, le mpahla yokugcina igcinwe igcwalisiwe ngamanzi ngokukhawuleza njengoko ikhutshiwe. Akukho chimney zangaphandle; Bavulwa ngqo kudonga olungasemva. Kwaye apha masibuye emva okomzuzwana.

       &quot;Zonke zilungele apho? HARCH, ke, kwaye uqalise yena. Upheke, umlilo wemisebenzi. &quot; Le nto yayiyinto elula, kuba umchweli yayikukuphola izipho zakhe kuyo yonke le nto. Nantsi ke loo nto kuhambo lokuya emfazwe umlilo wokuqala kwimisebenzi yokuzama kufuneka yondliwe kangangexeshana kunye neenkuni. Emva koko akukho mthi usetyenzisiweyo, ngaphandle kwendlela yokuhlisha ngokukhawuleza kwi-staills. ELizwini, emva kokuzanywa, i-crisp, i-Blubber, ngoku ebizwa ngokuba zii-screest okanye i-friters, isekhona iprojekhthi yayo engenabantu. Ezi friters zitya amadangatye. Njengomntu ovuthayo we-fertyre omdaka, okanye i-missumehrope yokuzidla, yakhangelwa, iminenga inika eyakhe ipetroli kwaye ivutha ngumzimba wakhe. Ungawugqitha umsi wakhe! ngokuba umsi wakhe woyikisa ukhululekile, uyinxibe, ungabi nayo, kodwa ke, kodwa kufuneka uphile ngalo ixesha. Inayo i-odon, endle, i-odor ye-Hindoo malunga nayo, enje nge-lirk kwindawo ekufutshane nePreereal fures. Inuka njengephiko lasekhohlo lomhla womgwebo; Yingxabano kumhadi.

       Ezinzulwini zobusuku imisebenzi yayisebenza ngokupheleleyo. Sasicaca sisidumbu; kwenziwe ekuqaleni; Umoya wawungxolo; Ubumnyama bolwandle basendle babucekisa. Kodwa ukuba ubumnyama baxhonywa ngamadangatye avuthayo, emalangatyeni aphethwe zii-sooty ezinqeni, kwaye bakhanyisela zonke iintambo ezikhulayo kwindawo yokugcina amanzi, njengomlilo wamaGrike wamaGrike. Inqanawa evuthayo yayiqhuba, ngokungathi igqithile kwisenzo esithile. Ke i-pitch kunye ne-rigfur-i-rigs-i-rigs-i-rigriote ebhalwe ngqindilili, i-canaris, ekhuphayo ezinzulwini zobusuku, enamaphepha aphezulu edangatyeni, kwaye wamongamela.

       I-hatch, isuswe encotsheni yemisebenzi, ngoku inikezele kakhulu phambi kwabo. Ukuma kwezi yayiziimilo ze-teartarean zeHarganers zeheden, zihlala zisitokhwe senqanawa. Ngezintsu ezinkulu eziphakameyo zamisa i-beds ye-blubber kwiimbiza ezinesidima, okanye zivuse imililo engaphantsi, de amalangatye e-sbaky aqhekeze ngeenyawo. Umsi waqengqeleka wemfumba. Kuwo onke amakhonkco enqanawa, kwakukho isigqubuthelo senqanawa yeoyile ebilayo, eyayibonakala yonke ingozi yokutsiba ebusweni babo. Ngokuchasene nomlomo wemisebenzi, kwelinye icala lentliziyo ebanzi, yayiyingqumbo. Oku kwabakho kwisofa yolwandle. Apha iwotshi yayilele, xa ingasetyenziswanga ngenye indlela, ijonge kubushushu obubomvu bomlilo, de amehlo abo aziva egqabhukile entloko. Iimpawu zabo zeTawny, ngoku ziphethwe ngumsi kunye nokubila, iindevu zabo ezivakalayo, kunye nobuqaqawuli bebhanti yamazinyo, zonke ezo zinto zatyhilwa ngendlela engaqhelekanga yemisebenzi. Njengoko babebalisa omnye komnye umntu wabo ngokungacacanga, iintsomi zawo zenkxo zichaze ngamazwi apheleleyo; Njengoko ukuhleka kwabo okungachaphazelekanga kubhekiswa phezulu kubo, njengamalangatye asesikweni; ngapha nangapha, ngaphambili, abaHarponey bahenyuza nge-harporants ngamafutha azo amakhulu aphezulu kunye needipd; Njengoko umoya wawugcuma, nolwandle lwaguduswa, kwaye inqanawa yancwina, yaye wasidubeza ngokuqinileyo esihogo elwandle kunye nobusuku, kwaye ngokuchasene nomlomo wakhe emlonyeni wakhe, kwaye ngenkohliso I-Spat emjikele macala onke; emva koko iPequod engxamile, ethwele iingxwabangxwaba, kwaye ithwele umlilo, kwaye itshisa isidumbu, kwaye ingena kobo bumnyama bobumnyama, yayibonakala ifana nomphefumlo womphathi wakhe we-monomaniac.

       Kubonakala ngathi kum, njengokuba ndimiyo kumhlophe wayo, kwaye ixesha elide lathusa iiyure lale nqanawa-nqanawa elwandle. Ndisongelwe, kuba ixesha lokuphumla, ebumnyameni ngokwam, kodwa kungcono ndibone ububomvu, ubuhlanya, ubugebenga babanye. Umbono oqhubekayo weemilo ezibukhali phambi kwam, isiqingatha somsi kunye nesiqingatha somlilo, ezi ekugqibeleni zazala imibono emphefumlweni wam, ngokukhawuleza nje ukuba ndiqalise ukunikezela kobo buthongo obungenakuphenduleka obunokuthi bufike phezu kwam ezinzulwini zobusuku. .

    <p>
       Kodwa ngobo busuku, ngokukodwa, omangalisayo (kwaye okoko kwenzeke into engenzeka kum. Ukuqala ngokulala okufutshane, bendineziphako ngentengo engalunganga. Umnini-moya wethambo wayibeka ecaleni kwam, eyathi yalo; Ezindlebeni zam yayizizimbiri ezisezantsi zeeseyile, ukuqala nje kokunyikima umoya; Ndacinga ukuba amehlo am avulekile; Ndaphanga isiqingatha sokwazi ukubeka iminwe yam kwizintolo kwaye ndizolulele ngokwahlukeneyo. Kodwa, ngaphandle kwako konke oku, andibonanga ndingaphambi kwam ukubetheka. Nangona kwakubonakala ngathi kungumzuzu okoko bendibukele ikhadi, ngesibane sebhayini esiqinileyo sasikhanyisela. Akukho nto ibonakala iphambi kwam kodwa ijethi emnyama, ngoku kwaye emva koko yenza ngokungxama. Eyona nto iphambili yayiyimvakalelo, ukuba nayiphi na into ekhawulezayo, engxamisekileyo endenze engazange iboshwe kakhulu kuyo nayiphi na i-aren engaphambi kokuba ivele kuyo yonke i-atnes engaphambi kwayo. Into ebukekayo, imvakalelo egudileyo, ekufeni, yaza phezu kwam. Izandla zam zibambekile zibamba umnyama, kodwa ngokugqabhuka okuphambili ukuba umzantsi wayekho, ngandlela thile, ngenye indlela eyodwa, ekhuselekile. Thixo wam! yintoni ingxaki yam? ndicinge. Khangela! Kwibutho lam nje elifutshane bendiye ndaziguqula, kwaye ndandiphambili kwinqanawa enkulu, ndimgoduke naye kwi-prow kunye nekhampasi. Ngephanyazo ndajongana nomva, kanye ngexesha lokuthintela inqanawa ukuba ingabhabha emoyeni, kwaye mhlawumbi iyibhukuqe. Hayi indlela ovuya ngayo kwaye sinombulelo ngayo isiqabu ekwenzeni oku kuhlungu kangaka kobusuku, kunye nokungakhathali kokuziswa yi-Lee!

       “There&#39;s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician&#39;s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, &#39;tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here&#39;s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.”

       “No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil&#39;s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to himself, leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read Belshazzar&#39;s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”

       “There now&#39;s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he&#39;s been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer&#39;s Hook, I&#39;d not look at it very long ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here&#39;s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I&#39;ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll&#39;s arithmetic, I&#39;ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here&#39;s the book. Let&#39;s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he&#39;s always among &#39;em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are—here they go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here&#39;s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among &#39;em. Aye, here on the coin he&#39;s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You&#39;ll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That&#39;s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch&#39;s navigator, and Daboll&#39;s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There&#39;s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I&#39;ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin: there&#39;s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that&#39;s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here&#39;s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep. There&#39;s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly&#39;s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let&#39;s hear what he&#39;ll have to say. There; he&#39;s before it; he&#39;ll out with something presently. So, so; he&#39;s beginning.”

       “I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what&#39;s all this staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that&#39;s true; and at two cents the cigar, that&#39;s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won&#39;t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here&#39;s nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy &#39;em out.”
    </p>

       “Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side of the mast; why, there&#39;s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he&#39;s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he&#39;s muttering—voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the sun stands in some one of these signs. I&#39;ve studied signs, and know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what&#39;s the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign—the roaring and devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.”

As I live he&#39;s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone; thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon&#39;s Astronomy in the back country. And by Jove, he&#39;s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh—I guess it&#39;s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don&#39;t know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king&#39;s trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he say, with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin—fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip—poor boy! would he had died, or I; he&#39;s half horrible to me. He too has been watching all of these interpreters—myself included—and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot face. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Upon my soul, he&#39;s been studying Murray&#39;s Grammar! Improving his mind, poor fellow! But what&#39;s that he says now—hist!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, he&#39;s getting it by heart—hist! again.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, that&#39;s funny.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I&#39;m a crow, especially when I stand a&#39;top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw! caw! caw! caw! caw! Ain&#39;t I a crow? And where&#39;s the scare-crow? There he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could go hang myself. Any way, for the present, I&#39;ll quit Pip&#39;s vicinity. I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he&#39;s too crazy-witty for my sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Here&#39;s the ship&#39;s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what&#39;s the consequence? Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught&#39;s nailed to the mast it&#39;s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he&#39;ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old darkey&#39;s wedding ring. How did it get there? And so they&#39;ll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser&#39;ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes &#39;mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!”

       CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.
    </h2>
    <h3 id="pgepubid00106">
       The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
    </h3>
    <p>
       “Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat&#39;s bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar&#39;s surcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hast seen the White Whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like a mallet.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near him—“Stand by to lower!”
    </p>
    <p>
       In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment&#39;s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen—to clamber up a ship&#39;s side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.
    </p>
    <p>
       It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.”
    </p>
    <p>
       As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can shrink, d&#39;ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did&#39;st thou see the White Whale?—how long ago?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from the capstan, and resting on the Englishman&#39;s shoulder, as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,” began the Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling round so, that my boat&#39;s crew could only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows&#39; feet and wrinkles.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended breath.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye—they were mine— 
      <i>
        my
      </i>
       irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow; but we didn&#39;t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale&#39;s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat&#39;s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate&#39;s boat—Mr. Mounttop&#39;s here (by the way, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop&#39;s boat, which, d&#39;ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes out—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale&#39;s tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell&#39;s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my arm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship&#39;s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains. But, at his superior&#39;s introduction of him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain&#39;s bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was a shocking bad wound,” began the whale-surgeon; “and, taking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed captain, addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering his voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn&#39;t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about three o&#39;clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don&#39;t ye? You know you&#39;re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I&#39;d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it&#39;s a sort of fits to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with the arm story.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing, sir, before Captain Boomer&#39;s facetious interruption, that spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule”—pointing at it with the marlingspike—“that is the captain&#39;s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one&#39;s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a wound—“Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here; he knows.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, I don&#39;t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we didn&#39;t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn&#39;t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick—as some call him—and then I knew it was he.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Did&#39;st thou cross his wake again?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Twice.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But could not fasten?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Didn&#39;t want to try to: ain&#39;t one limb enough? What should I do without this other arm? And I&#39;m thinking Moby Dick doesn&#39;t bite so much as he swallows.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to get the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man&#39;s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the White Whale&#39;s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d&#39;ye see. No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that&#39;s all.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he&#39;s welcome to the arm he has, since I can&#39;t help it, and didn&#39;t know him then; but not to another one. No more White Whales for me; I&#39;ve lowered for him once, and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye, he&#39;s best let alone; don&#39;t you think so, Captain?”—glancing at the ivory leg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He&#39;s all a magnet! How long since thou saw&#39;st him last? Which way heading?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend&#39;s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man&#39;s blood—bring the thermometer!—it&#39;s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab&#39;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the boat! Which way heading?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put. “What&#39;s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain crazy?” whispering Fedallah.
    </p>
    <p>
       But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take the boat&#39;s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards him, commanded the ship&#39;s sailors to stand by to lower.
    </p>
    <p>
       In a moment he was standing in the boat&#39;s stern, and the Manilla men were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.
