       ISAHLUKO 1. Izinto eziluliweyo.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Ndibizeleni uIshmayeli. Kwiminyaka eyadlulayo-ungakhathali ukuba lide kangakanani na ngokuchanekileyo-ndinemali encinci okanye ndingenayo engxoweni yam, kwaye kungekho nto inomdla kum elunxwemeni, ndacinga ukuba ndingahamba ngesikhephe kancinci kwaye ndibone indawo enamanzi yehlabathi. Yindlela endinayo yokukhupha udakada kunye nokulawula ukujikeleza. Nanini na xa ndizifumana ndikhula ndibuhlungu malunga nomlomo; nanini na kumanzi, ngoNovemba emphefumlweni wam; nanini na xa ndizifumana ngokungenakuzithandela ndinqumama phambi kweendawo zokugcina iibhokisi, kwaye ndizisa umva wawo wonke umngcwabo endidibana nawo; kwaye ngakumbi nanini na xa i-hypos yam ifumana isandla esiphezulu kum, kangangokuba ifuna umgaqo oqinileyo wokuziphatha ukundithintela ekungeneni ngabom esitratweni, kwaye ndibethe iminqwazi yabantu ngokucokisekileyo-ke, ndiyijonga njengelixesha lokuba ndifike elwandle kwakamsinya. njengoko ndinako. Le yindawo yam yompu kunye nebhola. Ngokukhula kwentanda-bulumko uCato uziphosa phezu kwekrele lakhe; Ndithe chu ukuya enqanaweni. Akukho nto imangalisayo kule nto. Ukuba bebeyazi loo nto, phantse bonke abantu ngokwesidanga sabo, ngaxesha lithile okanye kwelinye, baxabisa phantse iimvakalelo ezifanayo kulwandle kunye nam.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngoku kukho isixeko sakho esizimele geqe seManhattoes, esijikelezwe ziinqanawa njengeziqithi zaseIndiya ziingqaqa zekorale—urhwebo luyirhangqe ngokusefa kwayo. Ekunene nasekhohlo, izitrato zikuthatha ujonge emanzini. Embindini wayo ogqithisileyo yibhetri, apho loo ntsindazana intle ihlanjwa ngamaza, kwaye ipholiswe yimpepho, apho kwiiyure ezimbalwa ezidlulileyo ibingabonakali emhlabeni. Khangela isihlwele sabajongi bamanzi apho.
    </p>
    <p>
       Jikelezisa isixeko kwimvakwemini yeSabatha ephuphileyo. Hamba usuka kwi-Corlears Hook uye kwi-Coenties Slip, kwaye ukusuka apho, nge-Whitehall, emantla. Ubona ntoni?—Babekwe njengabalindi abangathethiyo kuyo yonke idolophu, kumi amawakawaka abantu abafayo behleli kwizonwabu zaselwandle. Abanye bangqiyame ngeengqumba; abanye behleli phezu kweentloko-zintlu; abanye bajonge phezu kweenqanawe ezivela eTshayina; abanye baphakame phezulu kumatshini wokurhweba, ngokungathi bazabalazela ukufumana indawo yokukroba elwandle. Ke aba bonke ngabalimi; yeentsuku zeveki ifakwe kwilath kunye ne-plaster-ibotshelelwe kwiikhawuntari, ibethelelwa ezihlahleni, igxininiswe kwiidesika. Ithini na ke le nto? Ngaba amasimi aluhlaza aphelile? Benza ntoni apha?
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa, khangela! naku kusiza izihlwele ezingakumbi, zigxalathelana ngqo emanzini, kwaye zibonakala ngathi ziza kuntywila. Iyamangalisa! Akukho nto iya kubanelisa ngaphandle kokuphela komda welizwe; ukuzulazula phantsi komthunzi weendawo zokugcina iimpahla aziyi kwanela. Akunjalo. Bamele basondele emanzini kangangoko banako ngaphandle kokuwela. Yaye nabo bemi—iikhilomitha zabo—iiligi. Bonke abemi balapho, baphuma kwiindledlana zeendlela, ezindleleni nakwiindledlana—emantla, empuma, emazantsi nasentshona. Ukanti apha bonke bayamanyana. Ndixelele, ngaba ubuhle bemagnethi beenaliti zeekhampasi zazo zonke ezo nqanawa zibatsalela apho?
    </p>
    <p>
       Kanye kwakhona. Yithi uselizweni; kumhlaba othile ophakamileyo wamachibi. Thatha phantse nayiphi na indlela othanda ngayo, ize ishumi uye kwenye ikuthwalise entilini, ikushiye apho ngasechibini lomlambo. Kukho umlingo kuyo. Oyena mntu ungekhoyo makangene kwezona ngcinga zakhe zinzulu—yima loo ndoda ngemilenze yayo, ibeke iinyawo zayo, yaye ngokuqinisekileyo iya kunikhokelela emanzini, ukuba amanzi akhoyo kuwo wonke loo mmandla. Ukuba unxaniwe kwintlango enkulu yaseMelika, zama olu vavanyo, ukuba ikharavani yakho ibonelelwe ngunjingalwazi wemetaphysical. Ewe, njengoko wonke umntu esazi, ukucamngca kunye namanzi zitshatile ngonaphakade.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa nali igcisa. Unqwenela ukukupeyinta eyona ndawo iphuphayo, enomthunzi, ezolileyo, eyona ndawo inomtsalane yothando kuyo yonke intlambo yeSaco. Yintoni eyona nto iphambili ayisebenzisayo? Kumi imithi yakhe, iyileyo inesiqobo somthi, ngathi kukho irhashalala nomnqamlezo; nali ke lilala idlelo lakhe, nantso imfuyo yakhe ilala; kwaye ukusuka ngaphaya kwindlu yangasese kuphuma umsi wobuthongo. Ngokunzulu kwimithi ethe qelele kukho indlela ebhudla ngayo, ifikelela kwiintaba ezithe qelele ezigutyungelwe ziinduli zazo eziluhlaza. Kodwa nangona umfanekiso ulele ngolo hlobo, kwaye nangona lo mthi wepayini ugungqisa ukuncwina kwawo njengamagqabi phezu kwentloko yalo malusi, kodwa zonke zazingento yanto, ngaphandle kokuba iliso lomalusi lithe ntsho kumlambo womlingo phambi kwakhe. Yiya kwiiPrairies ngoJuni, xa ngamanqaku amaninzi kwiikhilomitha ezininzi usihla ukuya kutsho emadolweni phakathi kweenyibiba zeTiger - yintoni ikhubalo elilodwa elifunayo?—Amanzi - akukho nethontsi lamanzi apho! Ngaba iNiagara yayilurhatyazo lwesanti, ngaba ubuya kuhamba iikhilomitha ezingamawaka akho ukuze uyibone? Kwakutheni ukuze imbongi ehlwempuzekileyo yaseTennessee, emva kokuba ifumene isilivere ezibini zesilivere, yenza ngabom ukuba imthengele idyasi, eyayiyidinga ngokulusizi, okanye ityale imali yayo kuhambo lwabahambi ngeenyawo oluya eRockaway Beach? Kutheni le nto phantse yonke inkwenkwe esempilweni eyomeleleyo enomphefumlo osempilweni owomeleleyo kuye, ngaxa lithile okanye enye iphambene ukuya elwandle? Kutheni kuhambo lwakho lokuqala njengomkhweli, ngaba nawe waziva ungcangcazela ngolo hlobo, xa wawuxelelwa okokuqala ukuba wena nenqanawa yakho ngoku aniboni emhlabeni? Kwakutheni ukuze amaPersi amandulo alubambe ngcwele ulwandle? Kwakutheni ukuze amaGrike amnike isithixo esahlukileyo, kunye nomntakwabo kaJove? Ngokuqinisekileyo yonke le nto ayinantsingiselo. Ibe isenzulu ngakumbi intsingiselo yelo bali likaNarcissus, owathi ngenxa yokuba engazange akwazi ukuwubamba umfanekiso wentuthumbo nowobulali awawubona emthonjeni, waziphosa kuwo waza warhaxwa. Kodwa loo mfanekiso mnye, nathi siwubona kuyo yonke imilambo neelwandlekazi. Ngumfanekiso wephantom engenakuqondwa yobomi; kwaye esi sisitshixo sayo yonke into.

       Ngoku, xa ndisithi ndinomkhwa wokuhamba elwandle ngalo lonke ixesha ndiqala ukuba luthuntu malunga namehlo, kwaye ndiqale ukuba nexhala ngemiphunga yam, andithethi kuthi mandikhe ndiye elwandle njengoko. umkhweli. Ukuze uhambe njengomkhweli kufuneka ube nesipaji, kwaye isipaji sisidlakadlaka ngaphandle kokuba unento kuso. Ngaphandle koko, abakhweli baguliswa lulwandle-bayaxambulisana-abalali ebusuku-abazonwabisi kakhulu, njengesiqhelo;-hayi, andikhe ndihambe njengomkhweli; kananjalo, nangona ndiyityuwa, andikhe ndiye elwandle njengeCommodore, okanye uMphathi, okanye uMpheki. Ndishiya uzuko kunye nokwahluka kwezikhundla ezinjalo kwabo babathandayo. Mna ke, ndiyakwenyanya konke ukusebenza okubekekileyo, izilingo, neembandezelo zalo lonke uhlobo. Kuninzi endinokukwenza ukuzikhathalela, ngaphandle kokukhathalela iinqanawa, ii-barques, iibrigs, schooners, kunye nantoni na. Kwaye malunga nokuhamba njengompheki,-nangona ndivuma ukuba kukho uzuko olukhulu kuloo nto, umpheki eluhlobo oluthile lwegosa enqanaweni-kodwa, ngandlela thile, andizange ndizithande iintaka eziphekiweyo;-nangona wakha waqhotswa, wagalelwa ibhotolo ngobuchule, kwaye wagweba. igalelwe ityuwa nepepile, akakho umntu oya kuthetha ngembeko, ndingathethi ngentlonipho, ngentaka eyosiweyo njengam. Kukunqulo-zithixo lwamaYiputa amandulo kumang’ang’ane agcadiweyo nehashe lomlambo eligcadiweyo, apho ubona izidumbu zezo zidalwa kwizindlu zazo ezinkulu zokubhaka iipiramidi.

       Hayi, xa ndisiya elwandle, ndihamba nje ngomatiloshe olula, kanye phambi kwemasti, ndiye kuthi xhaxhe kwinqaba yentelekelelo, phezulu phaya ukuya kwintloko yemasti yasebukhosini. Inyani, bathanda ukundiyalela malunga nokunye, kwaye bandenza ukuba nditsibe ukusuka kwi-spar ukuya kwi-spar, njengentethe kwidlelo likaMeyi. Kwaye ekuqaleni, olu hlobo lwento alukholisi ngokwaneleyo. Ichukumisa imbeko yomntu, ngakumbi ukuba uvela kusapho oludala olusekiweyo emhlabeni, iVan Rensselaers, okanye iRandolphs, okanye iHardicanutes. Kwaye ngaphezu kwako konke, ukuba ngaphambi nje kokufaka isandla sakho kwi-tar-pot, ubuyinkosi njengomphathi wesikolo sasemaphandleni, usenza abona bafana bade bamoyike. Inguquko inomdla, ndiyakuqinisekisa, ukusuka kumphathi wesikolo ukuya kumamatiloshe, kwaye ifuna i-decoction eyomeleleyo yeSeneca namaStoyike ukuze ukwazi ukuncwina kwaye uyinyamezele. Kodwa oku kuye kuphele ekuhambeni kwexesha.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kuthekani, ukuba ezinye iingxilimbela zikakapteni wolwandle zindiyalela ukuba ndithathe umtshayelo kwaye nditshayele phantsi? Kuthetha ukuthini oko kuthoba isidima, xa ndithetha, kwisikali seTestamente eNtsha? Ngaba ucinga ukuba isiphatha-zingelosi uGabriyeli ucinga nantoni na engaphantsi kum, kuba ndithobela ngokukhawuleza nangentlonipho loo ma-hunks akudala kuloo mzekelo? Ngubani na ongelokhoboka? Ndixelele lonto. Kulungile, ke, nangona abaphathi-mkhosi abadala baselwandle banokundiyalela malunga nokuba bangandibetha kwaye bandibethe ngamanqindi, ndinolwaneliseko lokwazi ukuba konke kulungile; ukuba wonke umntu ongomnye uyindlela enye okanye enye ekhonza ngayo ngendlela efanayo-nokuba kumbono womzimba okanye we-metaphysical, oko kukuthi; kwaye ke ingqukuva yendalo iphela idluliswa ngapha nangapha, kwaye zonke izandla kufuneka ziphululane amagxa omnye, kwaye zaneliseke.

       Kwakhona, ndisoloko ndihamba ngolwandle njengomatiloshe, kuba benza umzamo wokundihlawulela ingxaki yam, ngoxa bengahlawuli nabakhweli nesenti enye endakha ndeva ngayo. Ngokuchasene noko, abakhweli ngokwabo kufuneka bahlawule. Kwaye kukho wonke umahluko ehlabathini phakathi kokuhlawula nokuhlawulwa. Isenzo sokuhlawula mhlawumbi sesona senzo singathandekiyo esifunyenwe ngamasela amabini egadi yeziqhamo. Kodwa 
      <i>
        ukuhlawulwa
      </i>
       ,-kuya kuthelekiswa nantoni na? Umsebenzi wasezidolophini indoda efumana ngawo imali umangalisa ngokwenene, xa sicinga ukuba sikholelwa ngokunyanisekileyo ukuba imali iyingcambu yazo zonke izifo zasemhlabeni, nokuba akukho mntu unemali unokungena ezulwini. Ah! Hayi, ukuba sonwabile sizinikela entshabalalo!
    </p>
    <p>
       Okokugqibela, ndihlala ndisiya elwandle njengomatiloshe, ngenxa yokuzilolonga kunye nomoya ococekileyo weqonga lenqaba. Kuba njengakweli hlabathi, imimoya yentloko ixhaphake kakhulu kunemimoya evela empumalanga (oko kukuthi, ukuba awuzange waphule umthetho wePythagorean), ngoko ke ubukhulu becala iCommodore kwidekhi yekota ifumana umoya wayo kwisandla sesibini koomatiloshe. kwi-forecastle. Ucinga ukuba uyayiphefumla kuqala; kodwa akunjalo. Ngendlela efanayo, umanyano lukhokelela iinkokeli zabo kwezinye izinto ezininzi, kwangaxeshanye iinkokeli zikrokrela kancinci. Kungoko kwathi, emva kokuba ndilunyibilikisile ngokuphindaphindiweyo ulwandle njengomatiloshe womrhwebi, ndifanele ngoku ukukuthabatha entlokweni yam ndihambe ngohambo lokuloba intlanzi; eli polisa elingabonakaliyo le-Fates, elihlala lindigadile, kwaye lindibambe ngokufihlakeleyo, kwaye lindiphembelela ngandlela-thile engenakuphenduleka-inokuphendula ngcono kunaye nawuphi na omnye umntu. Kwaye, ngokungathandabuzekiyo, ukuhamba kwam kolu hambo lokuloba iminenga, kwaba yinxalenye yenkqubo enkulu yeProvidence eyayilwa kudala. Ingene njengohlobo longenelelo olufutshane kunye ne-solo phakathi kwemidlalo ebanzi ngakumbi. Ndithatha ukuba eli candelo lomthetho oyilwayo kufuneka liqhube into enje:

        Unyulo oluKhulu olukhuphiweyo kuMongameli wase-United States.

       “UHAMBO LOKUHAMBA NGOKWE-ISMAEL OMNYE. “UMLO WEGAZI E-AFFGHANISTAN.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Nangona ndingenako ukuxela ukuba kutheni kanye kanye abo baphathi beqonga, iFates, bandibeka phantsi kweli cala limdaka lohambo lokuloba iminenga, xa abanye babemiselwe iindawo ezimangalisayo kwiintlekele eziphakamileyo, kunye neenxalenye ezimfutshane nezilula kwii-genteel comedies, kwaye iindawo ezihlekisayo kwiifarces-nangona ndingazi ukuba kutheni le nto kanye; kodwa, ngoku xa ndikhumbula zonke iimeko, ndicinga ukuba ndiyakwazi ukubona kancinane kwimithombo kunye neenjongo ezivezwa kum ngobuqhetseba phantsi kwezinto ezahlukeneyo zokufihla, zandikhuthaza ukuba ndiqalise ukwenza indima endiyenzileyo, ngaphandle kokundifaka ekulahlekeni. yayilukhetho oluphuma kweyam inkululeko engakhethi cala kunye nokugweba okucalulayo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Eyona nto yayiphambili kwezi njongo yayiyingcamango eyoyikekayo yomnenga omkhulu ngokwakhe. Irhamncwa elimangalisayo nelimangalisayo liwuvuselele wonke umdla wam. Emva koko ulwandle olusendle kunye nolukude apho waqengqeleka khona isiqithi sakhe esikhulu; iingozi ezingenakuchazwa, ezingenagama zomnenga; ezi, nazo zonke izimanga ezizimasayo zewaka lezinto ezibonwayo zePatagonian kunye nezandi, zandinceda ukuba ndibe nomnqweno wam. Ngamanye amadoda, mhlawumbi, ezo zinto bezingayi kuba zizikhuthazi; kodwa mna, ndithuthunjiswa ngokurhawuzelelwa ngonaphakade ngenxa yezinto ezikude. Ndiyakuthanda ukuhamba ngenqanawa kwiilwandle ezingavumelekanga, kwaye ndihlale kumanxweme ahlabayo. Ndingakuhoyi okulungileyo, ndiyakhawuleza ukubona into eyothusayo, kwaye ndisenobudlelwane nayo — bangandivumela — kuba kulungile ukuba nobuhlobo kunye nawo onke amabanjwa ale ndawo ahlala kuyo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngoko ngenxa yezo zinto, uhambo lokuloba intlanzi lwamkelekile; Amasango amakhulu ehlabathi elimangalisayo avuleka, kwaye kwimibhobho yasendle eyandikhokelela kwinjongo yam, amabini anamabini apho adada kumphefumlo wam ongaphakathi, umngcelele ongapheliyo womnenga, kwaye, phakathi kwabo bonke, enye. i-phantom ene-hooded enkulu, njengenduli yekhephu emoyeni.

       ISAHLUKO 2. Ikhaphethi-Bag.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Ndahlohla ihempe okanye ezimbini kwikhaphethi-bhegi yam endala, ndayifaka phantsi kwengalo yam, ndaqalisa ukuya eCape Horn nasePasifiki. Ukushiya idolophu elungileyo yaseManhatto yakudala, ndafika ngokufanelekileyo eNew Bedford. BekungoMgqibelo ebusuku kuDecember. Ndadana kakhulu xa ndifunda ukuba ipakethi encinci yeNantucket sele ihambile, kwaye akukho ndlela yokufikelela kuloo ndawo inokubonelela, kude kube ngoMvulo olandelayo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Njengoko uninzi lwabagqatswa abancinci beentlungu kunye nezohlwayo zokuloba iminenga bemisa kwalapha kwaNew Bedford, ukusukela apho ukuze baqalise uhambo lwabo, kusenokunxulunyaniswa nokuba mna, mna, bendingenambono wokwenza njalo. Kuba ingqondo yam yenzelwe ukuba ihambe ngesikhephe ngaphandle kwe-craft yaseNantucket, kuba kwakukho into entle, exokozelayo malunga nayo yonke into enxulumene neso siqithi sidala sidumileyo, eyandivuyisa ngokumangalisayo. Ngaphandle koko nangona i-New Bedford sele kukade ilawula ngokuthe ngcembe ishishini lokuloba, kwaye nangona kulo mbandela i-Nantucket endala ihlwempuzekileyo ngoku isemva kwayo, kodwa i-Nantucket yayiyeyona nto ibalaseleyo—iTire yale Carthage;—indawo apho umntu wokuqala waseMelika ofileyo. umnenga wabanjwa. Kuphi kwenye indawo ngaphandle kwaseNantucket apho abo bomnenga bomthonyama, iRed-Men, baqala bakhwela amaphenyane ukuze baleqe iLeviyatan? Kwaye phi kodwa ukusuka eNantucket, kwakhona, lathi lavela khona elo litye lincinci lokuqala, ngokuyinxenye lithwele amatye ecobblestones angeniswa kumazwe angaphandle-lihamba ke ibali-ukuphosa iminenga, ukuze bafumanise xa bekufuphi ngokwaneleyo ukuba babeke umngcipheko kwi-harpoon evela kwi-bowsprit. ?
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngoku ndandinobusuku, imini enye, kwanobunye ubusuku obulandelayo phambi kwam eNew Bedford, ngaphambi kokuba ndibe nokukhwela inqanawa ukuya kwizibuko endandimiselwe kulo, yaba ngumcimbi oxhalabisayo apho ndandiza kutya ndilale khona okwangoku. Yayibubusuku obukhangeleka buthandabuzeka kakhulu, hayi, ubusuku obumnyama kakhulu nobulusizi, ingqele eqhaqhazelis’ amazinyo kwaye ingenamincili. Ndandingazi mntu kuloo ndawo. Ngeegrapnel ezixhalabileyo ndayivasa ipokotho yam, kwaye ndanyusa amaqhosha esilivere ambalwa,-ke, naphi na apho uya khona, uIshmayeli, ndazithethela, njengoko ndandimi embindini wesitrato esoyikekayo ndiphethe ibhegi yam, kwaye ndithelekisa Ubumnyama bubhekise entla, ubumnyama bubhekise ezantsi, naphi na apho ngobulumko bakho onokuthi ulale ebusuku, Sithandwa sam, Ishmayeli, qiniseka ukubuza ixabiso, ungangxi kakhulu.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngezinyuko zokuma ndanyathela ezitalatweni, ndadlula umqondiso othi “The Crossed Harpoons”—kodwa yayikhangeleka ibiza kakhulu kwaye ichwayitile apho. Ngokubhekele phaya, kwiifestile ezibomvu eziqaqambileyo ze-“Sword-Fish Inn,” kwavela imitha eshushu, kangangokuba kwakubonakala ngathi yayinyibilikise ikhephu elizele ngumkhenkce phambi kwendlu, kuba kuyo yonke indawo enye iqabaka ejiyileyo yayiziisentimitha ezilishumi ubukhulu phakathi. Ipavumente eqinile, ene-asphaltic,-ndaweni yoko ndadinwa kum, xa ndibethe unyawo lwam ngokuchasene noqikelelo oluthambileyo, ngenxa yokuba ukusuka kwinkonzo enzima, engazisoliyo iibhutsi zam zazikweyona ngxaki ilusizi. Ibiza kakhulu kwaye inoburharha, ndaphinda ndacinga, ndinqumama umzuzwana ndibukele ilitha elibanzi esitratweni, ndive nezandi zeglasi ezikhenkcezayo ngaphakathi. Kodwa hamba, Ishmayeli, ndathi ekugqibeleni; Awuva na? suka phambi komnyango; iibhutsi zakho ezilahliweyo zimisa indlela. Ndahamba ke. Ngoku ngethuku ndalandela izitrato ezazindithatha ndisemanzini, kuba apho, ngokungathandabuzekiyo, yayizezona zingabizi kakhulu, ukuba yayingezizo ezona ndawo zokulala.
    </p>
    <p>
       Izitrato ezoyikekayo! iibhloko ezimnyama, hayi izindlu, nakweliphi na icala, kwaye apha naphaya ikhandlela, njengekhandlela elihambahamba engcwabeni. Ngelixa lobusuku, lomhla wokugqibela weveki, laa kota yedolophu ingqineke iyintlango. Kodwa ngoku ndifike kwisibane esiqhumayo siphuma kwisakhiwo esisezantsi, esibanzi, ucango lwaso limi luvulekile ngendlela ekhuthazayo. Yayinenkangeleko yokungakhathali, ngokungathi yayilungiselelwe ukusetyenziswa luluntu; ke, ukungena, into yokuqala endayenzayo kukukhubeka kwibhokisi yothuthu everanda. Hayi! Ndacinga, hee, njengoko amasuntswana aphaphazelayo aphantse andikrwitsha, ngaba olu thuthu lweso sixeko sitshatyalalisiwe, iGomora? Kodwa elithi “The Crossed Harpoons,” nelithi “The Sword-fish?”—oku, ngoko kumele kube ngumqondiso othi “The Trap.” Nangona kunjalo, ndaziphakamisa ndeva ilizwi elikhulu ngaphakathi, ndatyhala ndavula ucango lwesibini, lwangaphakathi.

       Kwakubonakala iPalamente enkulu emnyama ehleli eTofethi. Ikhulu lobuso obumnyama bujike kwimiqolo yabo ukuba bukhangele; nangaphaya, iNgelosi emnyama yeDoom yayibetha incwadi epulpitini. Yayilibandla lama-negro; kwaye isicatshulwa somshumayeli sasimalunga nobumnyama bobumnyama, kunye nokulila nokulila nokutshixiza kwamazinyo apho. Hayi, uIshmayeli, ndambombozela, ndirhoxa, Ukonwabisa okulusizi kuphawu oluthi &#39;Umgibe!&#39;

       Ndiqhubela phambili, ekugqibeleni ndafika ekukhanyeni okumfiliba kude kufuphi nezikhululo, ndeva isandi esidakumbileyo sisitsho emoyeni; waza wajonga phezulu, wabona uphawu olujingayo phezu kocango olunomzobo omhlophe phezu kwalo, lubonisa kancinane ijethi ende ethe tye yesitshizi senkungu, nala magama angaphantsi—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”

       Ibhokisi?—Spouter?—Ndacinga ukuba yoyikeka kuloo ndibano. Kodwa ligama eliqhelekileyo eNantucket, batsho, kwaye ndicinga ukuba lo Petros ulapha ngumphambukeli osuka apho. Njengoko ukukhanya kwakujongeka kumfiliba kangako, nendawo, okwexesha, ikhangeleka izolile ngokwaneleyo, kwaye nendlu encinane edilikayo eyenziwe ngamaplanga ngokwayo yayikhangeleka ngathi inokuba yayithwelwe apha isuka kumabhodlo esithili esithile esitshisiweyo, nanjengoko umqondiso wokujingi wawunophawu. uhlobo lwentlupheko lwe-creak kuyo, ndacinga ukuba nantsi indawo yeendawo zokulala ezincinci, kunye neyona ikofu ye-ertyisi.

       Yayiyindawo enqabileyo-indlu endala egayiwe, elinye icala likhubazekile ngokungathi kunjalo, kwaye lingqiyame phezu kalusizi. Yema kwikona elimfiliba, apho umoya osisaqhwithi waseEurolidon waqhubela phambili ubhomboloza ngakumbi kunangaphambili ngenxa yobuhlwempu obuphetshethwa nguPawulos. I-Euroclydon, nangona kunjalo, i-zephyr enamandla emnandi kuye nabani na ongaphakathi, kunye neenyawo zakhe phezu kwe-hob ngokuzola ngokuzola ukuya kulala. Umbhali omdala uthi: “Ngokugweba lo moya uvuthuzayo ubizwa ngokuba yiEuroclidon, ekuphela kwencwadi esele ikho—yenza umahluko omangalisayo, nokuba uwujonge ngefestile yeglasi apho iqabaka iphezu komhlaba. ngaphandle, okanye ujonge kulaa festile ingenamrhintyelo, apho iqabaka macala omabini, kwaye apho uKufa kukuphela komkhenkce.” Inene, ndacinga njalo, njengoko esi sicatshulwa sasisithi qatha engqondweni yam—unobumba omdala omnyama, uqiqa kakuhle. Ewe, la mehlo ziifestile, kwaye lo mzimba wam yindlu. Olunjani usizi ukuba abazange bathintele ii-chinks kunye neekrani nangona kunjalo, kwaye bafake i-lint encinci apha naphaya. Kodwa kusemva kwexesha kakhulu ukwenza naluphi na uphuculo ngoku. Indalo iphela igqityiwe; I-copestone ivuliwe, kwaye iitshiphusi zakhutshwa kwisigidi seminyaka eyadlulayo. ULazaro osizana apho, engxola amazinyo akhe phezu kwenqwanqwa lomqamelo, evuthulula amagqabi akhe ngokungcangcazela kwakhe, angaziqhobosha izikhwebu zombini ngamadlavu, agalele isikhwebu emlonyeni wakhe, kanti noko loo nto yayingayi kuphumela ngaphandle. isivuthuvuthu se-Euroclidon. I-Euroclidon! utsho uDives omdala, enxibe isisongelo sakhe esibomvu sesilika-(wayenenye ebomvu emva koko) ooh, ooh! Obunjani bona ubusuku obuneqabaka; indlela imenyezela ngayo iOrion; ezinjani izibane zasentla! Mabathethe ngemozulu yabo yasehlotyeni yasempumalanga yeendawo zolondolozo lwendalo zanaphakade; ndinike inyhweba yokuzenzela ihlobo lam ngamalahle am.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa uthini uLazaro? Angakwazi ukufudumeza izandla zakhe eziblue ngokuziphakamisela kwizibane ezinkulu zasentla? Ngaba uLazaro ebengayi kuba seSumatra kunalapha? Ngaba ebengekhe ambeke phantsi ngobude ngomgca we-ikhweyitha; ewe, zizithixo! uhle uye emhadini womlilo, unqande le qabaka?
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngoku, ukuba uLazaro kufuneka alale evaleleke phaya kwilitye elisecaleni komnyango weDives, oku kumangalisa ngakumbi kunokuba umkhenkce ubotshelelwe kwenye yeeMoluccas. Ukanti uDives ngokwakhe, naye uphila njengoCzar kwibhotwe lomkhenkce elenziwe ngokuncwina okukhenkcezayo, kwaye njengomongameli woluntu olunesimilo, usela kuphela iinyembezi ezinomsindo zeenkedama.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa akusekho oku kubhanxa ngoku, siya kurhwaphiliza, kwaye kuninzi oko kusezayo. Masikrazule umkhenkce kwiinyawo zethu ezineqabaka, kwaye sibone ukuba inokuba yindawo enjani na le “Spouter”.

       ISAHLUKO 3. I-Spouter-Inn.

       Ukungena kwi-Spouter-Inn ene-gable, ufumene indawo yokungena ebanzi, ephantsi, egxadazayo ene-wainscots yakudala, ukhumbuza enye inqaba yobugcisa obudala obugwetyiweyo. Kwelinye icala kwakuxhonywe ipeyinti ye-oyile enkulu kakhulu etshayiweyo, kwaye zonke iindlela zonakaliswe, ukuba kwii-crosslights ezingalinganiyo owawujonga ngayo, kuphela ngokufunda ngenkuthalo kunye nothotho lotyelelo olucwangcisiweyo kuyo, kunye nokubuza ngononophelo kubamelwane, ukuba unako nangayiphi na indlela ukufikelela ekuqondeni injongo yayo. Ubuninzi obungaphendulekiyo bemithunzi kunye nezithunzi, ukuba ekuqaleni uphantse wacinga ukuba igcisa eliselula elinamabhongo, ngexesha leehagi zaseNew England, lizamile ukucacisa isiphithiphithi sithakathiwe. Kodwa ngokucinga okuninzi kunye nokucamngca ngokunyanisekileyo, kunye nokucinga okuphindaphindiweyo, kwaye ngakumbi ngokuvula ifestile encinci ngasemva kwendawo yokungena, ekugqibeleni ufikelela kwisigqibo sokuba umbono onjalo, nangona ukhohlakele, unokungafuneki kwaphela.

       Kodwa eyona nto ibikuxaka kwaye ikubhidanise bubunzima obude, obunomzimba, obumangalisayo, obumnyama bento ejikeleza embindini womfanekiso ngaphezulu kwemigca emithathu eluhlaza, emfiliba, engqukuva edada kwigwele elingenagama. Umfanekiso obhityileyo, obhityileyo, okrwada ngokwenene, owaneleyo ukuqhuba indoda enovalo ephazamisekileyo. Nangona kunjalo bekukho uhlobo olungenasiphelo, olufunyenwe ngesiqingatha, ubungangamsha obungenakucingelwa malunga nalo obukukhwankqise kulo, wade wathatha isifungo kunye nawe ukuba ufumanise ukuba uthetha ukuthini lo mzobo umangalisayo. Ngalo lonke ixesha uya kutyhutyha ingcamango ekhohlisayo.—LuLwandle Olumnyama kwisaqhwithi sasezinzulwini zobusuku.—Lumlo ongekho ngokwemvelo wezinto ezine eziphambili.—Ngumlo wasebusika oqhushumbayo.—Yimeko yasebusika ebangelwa yiHyperborean. .—Kukuqhekeka komsinga weXesha. Kodwa ekugqibeleni zonke ezi zinto zinqwenelekayo zanikezela kuloo nto imangalisayo iphakathi komfanekiso.

       Enyanisweni, uyilo lomzobi lwalubonakala ngolu hlobo: ithiyori yokugqibela eyeyam, ngokuyinxenye isekelwe kwiingcamango ezidityanisiweyo zabantu abaninzi abasele bekhulile endancokola nabo ngalo mbandela. Umfanekiso umele iCape-Horner kwinkanyamba enkulu; inqanawe esekwe isiqingatha ijinga apho kunye neepali zayo ezintathu eziqhawulweyo zodwa ezibonakalayo; kwaye umnenga onomsindo, onenjongo yokuphuma ucocekile phezu komkhumbi, usesenzo esikhulu sokuzixhoma kwiintloko ezintathu zemasti.

       Udonga oluchasene nolu ngenelelo lwaluxhonywe lonke ludwendwe lwamagqudu nemikhonto eyoyikekayo. Zimbi zazithe shinyi zinamazinyo amenyezelayo angathi ziisarha zophondo lwendlovu; abanye babenamaqhina eenwele zomntu; yaye enye yayimile okwerhengqa, inomqheba omkhulu otshayelayo ngathi licandelo elenziwe kwingca entsha echetyiweyo ngumchebi oxhobe ixesha elide. Uye wangcangcazela xa ujongile, kwaye uzibuza ukuba yeyiphi i-cannibal ekhohlakeleyo nekhohlakeleyo enokuthi ihambe iye kuvuna ifa ngesixhobo sokuqhekeza, esoyikekayo. Xa zixutywe nezi yayiziincula zeminenga emidala kunye neeharpoons ezaphukileyo nezineziphene. Ezinye yayizizixhobo zembali. Ngalo mkhonto wakha wande, ngoku unengqiniba enzima, kwiminyaka engamashumi amahlanu eyadlulayo, uNathan Swain wabulala iminenga elishumi elinesihlanu phakathi kokuphuma kwelanga nokutshona kwelanga. Kwaye laa hapuni-enje nge-corkscrew ngoku-yaphoswa kulwandle lwaseJavan, yabaleka nomnenga, kwiminyaka emva koko yabulawa kwiKapa laseBlanco. Intsimbi yokuqala yangena kufuphi nomsila, kwaye, njengenaliti engaphumliyo ehlala emzibeni wendoda, yahamba iinyawo ezingamashumi amane ngokupheleleyo, kwaye ekugqibeleni yafunyanwa ifakwe kwi-hump.

       Ukuwela le ndawo yokungena kurhatyela, kwaye udlula ngendlela ephantsi-unqumle into eyayimele ukuba yayiyitshimini enkulu esembindini eneendawo zokucima umlilo-ungena kwigumbi likawonke-wonke. Indawo eseyenziwe i-duskier yile, enemiqadi ephantsi ephantsi, kunye namaplanga amadala ashwabeneyo ngaphantsi, kangangokuba ungaphantse unqwenele ukuba unyathele ii-cockpits zakudala, ngakumbi obo busuku bukhalayo, xa lo mkhombe wakudala une-ankile wanyikima ngokukrakra. . Kwelinye icala kwakumi itafile ende, ephantsi, efana neshelufu egqunywe ziikesi zeglasi eziqhekekileyo, ezele ziindawo ezinothuli eziqokelelwe kwezona ndawo zikude zehlabathi. Ujonge kwelinye icala legumbi kukho umngxuma okhangeleka umnyama—ibhari—indlela ekrwada yokuzama ukunqumla intloko yomnenga. Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na, kumi ithambo elikhulu lomhlathi womnenga, libanzi kangangokuba umqeqeshi usenokuphantse aqhube ngaphantsi kwawo. Ngaphakathi kukho iishelufu ezidlakadlaka, ezingqukuva ezinee-decanters ezindala, iibhotile, iiflaski; nakuloo mihlathi yentshabalalo ekhawulezileyo, njengomnye uYona oqalekisiweyo (igama ababembiza ngalo ngokwenene), kuyaphithizela ixhego elincinane elishwabeneyo, elathi, ngenxa yemali yalo, libathengisela oomatiloshe iziyolo nokufa.

Ndamfuna umnini-ndlu, ndaza ndamxelela ukuba ndinqwenela ukuhlaliswa negumbi, ndafumana impendulo yokuba indlu yakhe izele—kungekhona ibhedi engahlali mntu. “Kodwa avast,” wongeze watsho, ebetha ibunzi lakhe, “awufuni ukwabelana ngengubo yeharpooneer, akunjalo?

       Ekugqibeleni, malunga nesine okanye abahlanu kuthi babizelwa kwisidlo sethu kwigumbi elikufuphi. Kwakubanda njengoko iIceland—ingenamlilo kwaphela—umninimzi wayesithi akanakukwazi ukuyihlawula. Akukho nto ngaphandle kwamakhandlela amabini amnyama, ngalinye likwishiti elijingayo. Besingxamele ukuqhobosha iibhatyi zethu zenkawu, kwaye sibambe emilebeni iikomityi zeti etshisayo ngeminwe yethu engumkhenkce. Kodwa imali yokukhwela yayiyeyona nto ibalulekileyo—kungekhona inyama neetapile kuphela, kodwa amadombolo; izulu elihle! amadombolo kwisidlo sangokuhlwa! Omnye umfana onxibe idyasi yebhokisi eluhlaza, wazibhekisa kula madombolo ngeyona ndlela imbi.

       Andizange ndikwazi ukuzibamba, kodwa ndaqalisa ukurhanela le “bala mnyama” ihapuni. Noko ke, ndenza isigqibo sokuba xa kusenzeka ukuba silale sobabini, umele akhulule akhulule angene ebhedini ngaphambi kokuba ndilale.

       Ukunyathelwa kweebhutsi zaselwandle kwavakala ekungeneni; ucango lwavuleka, kwaye kuqengqeleka isethi yabaqhubi basendle ngokwaneleyo. Begutyungelwe ziidyasi zabo zewotshi ezimdaka, kwaye iintloko zabo zithe khunubembe zizithuthuzeli zoboya, zonke zineebhedi ezidlakadlaka, neendevu zabo ziqinile ngenxa yeicicles, babonakala ngathi kukugqabhuka kweebhere ezivela eLabrador. Babesandul’ ukuhla kwisikhephe sabo, yaye le yayiyindlu yokuqala abangena kuyo. Akumangalisi ke ngoko, ukuba bawuvuse ngokuthe ngqo umlomo womnenga—indawo yokuhlambela—xa uYona omncinane oshwabeneyo, owayelapho, wakhawuleza wayigalela imilomo yawo yonke loo nto. Omnye wakhalaza ngengqele embi entlokweni yakhe, apho uYona wamxuba i-gin kunye ne-molasses enjenge-pitch, awayifungayo yayiliyeza elinamandla kuyo yonke imikhuhlane kunye ne-catarrh, ungakhathali nokuba umi ixesha elingakanani, okanye ubanjwe. unxweme lwaseLabrador, okanye kwicala lemozulu yesiqithi se-ice.

       Ndaqaphela, nangona kunjalo, ukuba omnye wabo wayezibekele bucala ngandlel’ ithile, kwaye nangona wayebonakala enqwenela ukungonakalisi ukonwaba kwabo wayehamba nabo ngesikhephe ngobuso bakhe obupholileyo, kodwa kuko konke waye wayeka ukwenza ingxolo njengabanye. Le ndoda yandithanda kwaoko; yaye ekubeni oothixo baselwandle babemmisele ukuba abe ngumafikizolo kum (nangona eyindoda eleleyo, ngokwale ngxelo), apha ndiya kufikelela kwingcaciso encinane ngaye. Wema egcwele iinyawo ezintandathu ukuphakama, enamagxa ahloniphekileyo, kunye nesifuba esifana nedama lebhokisi. Andifane ndiyibone indoda ekrwada kangaka. Ubuso bakhe babumdaka ngokunzulu kwaye butshile, okwenza amazinyo akhe amhlophe abengezela ngokwahlukileyo; ngoxa kwithunzi elinzulu lamehlo akhe kwakudada ezinye zezikhumbuzo ezazibonakala zingamniki uvuyo olungako. Ilizwi lakhe kwangoko labhengeza ukuba ungowaseMazantsi, kwaye ukusuka kwisimo sakhe esihle, ndacinga ukuba inokuba ngomnye wabanyuki bentaba bade baseAlleghanian Ridge eVirginia. Kuthe xa kuthe gqi isiyunguma sabalingane bakhe, watyibilika engabonwa mntu, andaphinda ndambona wade waba ngumlingane wam elwandle. Kwimizuzu embalwa, nangona kunjalo, waphoswa ngabaqhubi bakhe, kwaye, kubonakala ngathi, ngenxa yesizathu esithile ethandwa kakhulu nabo, baphakamisa isikhalo esithi &quot;Bulkington! Bulkington! iphi iBulkington?” wabaleka ukuphuma endlwini, emsukela.
    </p>
    <p>
       It was now about nine o&#39;clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
       No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. I don&#39;t know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
    </p>
    <p>
       The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord! I&#39;ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan&#39;t sleep with him. I&#39;ll try the bench here.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Just as you please; I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it&#39;s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I&#39;ve got a carpenter&#39;s plane there in the bar—wait, I say, and I&#39;ll make ye snug enough.” So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven&#39;s sake to quit—the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
       I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.
    </p>
    <p>
       The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn&#39;t I steal a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
    </p>
    <p>
       Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person&#39;s bed, I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I&#39;ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long. I&#39;ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there&#39;s no telling.
    </p>
    <p>
       But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o&#39;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
       The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he answered, “generally he&#39;s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to rise—yes, he&#39;s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don&#39;t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can&#39;t sell his head.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Can&#39;t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “That&#39;s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn&#39;t sell it here, the market&#39;s overstocked.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “With what?” shouted I.
    </p>
    <p>
       “With heads to be sure; ain&#39;t there too many heads in the world?”

    <p>
       “I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you&#39;d better stop spinning that yarn to me—I&#39;m not green.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther guess you&#39;ll be done 
      <i>
        brown
      </i>
       if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin&#39; his head.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I&#39;ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord&#39;s.
    </p>
    <p>
       “It&#39;s broke a&#39;ready,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Broke,” said I—“ 
      <i>
        broke
      </i>
       , do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sartain, and that&#39;s the very reason he can&#39;t sell it, I guess.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I&#39;ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, 
      <i>
        you
      </i>
       I mean, landlord, 
      <i>
        you
      </i>
       , sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that&#39;s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin&#39; you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of &#39;balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he&#39;s sold all on &#39;em but one, and that one he&#39;s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow&#39;s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin&#39; human heads about the streets when folks is goin&#39; to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin&#39; out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.”
    </p>
    <p>
       This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “He pays reg&#39;lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it&#39;s getting dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes—it&#39;s a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There&#39;s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it&#39;s an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn&#39;t do. Come along here, I&#39;ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it&#39;s Sunday—you won&#39;t see that harpooneer to-night; he&#39;s come to anchor somewhere—come along then; 
      <i>
        do
      </i>
       come; 
      <i>
        won&#39;t
      </i>
       ye come?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
       “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman&#39;s bag, containing the harpooneer&#39;s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
       But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
       I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer&#39;s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
       Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag&#39;s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes, it&#39;s just as I thought, he&#39;s a terrible bedfellow; he&#39;s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It&#39;s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun&#39;s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
       Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years&#39; War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!
    </p>
    <p>
       But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days&#39; old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
    </p>
    <p>
       I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
       All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.
    </p>
    <p>
       But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
    </p>
    <p>
       Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.” And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord, for God&#39;s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Don&#39;t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn&#39;t harm a hair of your head.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn&#39;t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I thought ye know&#39;d it;—didn&#39;t I tell ye, he was a peddlin&#39; heads around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
       “You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What&#39;s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself—the man&#39;s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don&#39;t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It&#39;s dangerous. Besides, I ain&#39;t insured.”
    </p>
    <p>
       This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to say—“I won&#39;t touch a leg of ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
    </p>
    <p>
       I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
