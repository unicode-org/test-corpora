       ISAHLUKO 10. Mhlobo we-bosom.

    <p>
       Ukubuyela kwi-Spoter-Inne-In kwi-chapeleque, ndafumana iQueequeg apho yedwa; Wayeyishiyile i-chapel phambi koThixo ixesha elithile. Wayehleli ebhentshini phambi komlilo, ezinyaweni zakhe kwisitovu, kwaye ngesandla esinye sasiphangele ebusweni baso sisithixo esincinci se-nere; ejonge ngamandla ebusweni bayo, kwaye ngemela kajack eyibetha kancinci empumlweni, ngelo xesha encwina yedwa ngendlela yakhe yobuhedeni.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa ngoku ukuphazamiseka, wafaka umfanekiso; Kwaye kungekudala, ukuya etafileni, ukuya etafileni, kwathatha incwadi enkulu apho, kwaye iyibeka ezingubeni zakhe, yaqala ukubala amaphepha ngokuthi rhoqo; Kuwo onke amaphepha angamashumi asie Uya kwandula ke aqale ukuqalisa kwishumi mahlanu eg epheleleyo; Kubonakala ngathi uqale inani ngalinye, ngokungathi akanakukwazi ukubala ngaphezu kwamashumi amahlanu, kwaye yayilinani elikhulu kuphela lamashumi amahlanu afunyanwa kunye, ukuba isothuso sakhe esininzi lamaphepha lawonwabile.

       Ndinomdla kakhulu endinomdla kuyo. Ukutyibilika nangona wayekhohlakele ngobuso - ubuncinci obunencasa wam, ubuso bakhe baba nento ekungekho nto kuyo eyayingavisisani. Awungekhe ufihle umphefumlo. Kuyo yonke imivambo yakhe yangaphandle, ndacinga ukuba ndibona umkhondo wentliziyo elula enyanisekileyo; Kwaye ngamehlo akhe amakhulu, anzulu, umnyama, umnyama, inkalipho, kwakufumanisa ukuba i-moya ebengayifumana iwaka leedemon. Ngaphandle kwayo yonke le nto, kwabakho into ephakamileyo kakhulu malunga neheden, engazange ibulale inkululeko yayo ayinakuze ingenzeki i-maim. Wayefana nendoda engazange iqasheke kwaye ayizange ibe nombolekisi. Nokuba yayikho, nokuba intloko yakhe ichetyiwe, kwakuqhutywa intloko yakhe eFreeter nakukhanyisa, kwaye kwakukhangeleka ngakumbi kunokuba kungenjalo, oku andizukuthatha isigqibo; Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo yayiyintloko yakhe yayingoyena mntu ubalaseleyo. Isenokubonakala intle, kodwa yandikhumbuza ngentloko yeWashington, njengoko ibonwa kwiintloko zakhe ezithandwayo kuye. Kwakukuphela kwethambeka elilinganayo elide libuyele ngaphezulu kwee-BRICS, ezazingamaqhinga amaninzi, njengabanqabileyo amabini amafutshane. I-Queeequeg yayiyi-George Washington cannibalicalistily.

       Ngelixa ndisondela ngokusondeleyo, ndisenza ngathi ndikhangela kwisiphango esivela evenini engqondweni, akazange athobele ubukho bam, akazange azikhathaze kakhulu njengokujonga okungatshatanga; Kodwa wabonakala ngokupheleleyo ukubala amaphepha encwadi emangalisayo. Ukujonga indlela ebesilele ngayo sobabini kubusuku obudlulileyo, kwaye ngakumbi xa sijonga ingalo yothando endiyifumene iphoswe phezu kwam ekuvukeni kwam ekuseni, ndacinga oku kungakhathali kwakhe okungaqhelekanga. Kodwa ukuthuthuza ngabantu abangaqhelekanga; ngamanye amaxesha awuyazi ncam ukuba uzithatha njani. Ekuqaleni banqumama; Ukuzola kwabo-qokeleleka kwabo kubonakala kubonakala bubulumko baseSoldral. Ndiqaphele ukuba i-queeequeg ayikaze ikhutshelwe, okanye kodwa incinci kakhulu, elinye lalithi laaitan kwi-Inn. Akazange ufike nantoni na; kubonakala ngathi akukho mnqweno wokwandisa isangqa sabaqhelekileyo. Yonke le nto yandibetha njengegorha elinamandla; Ukanti, kwiingcinga zesibini, kukho into ephantse yadlula kuyo. Nali indoda yamawaka amawaka amawaka eekhilomitha ukusuka ekhaya, ngendlela yeCape Hern, oko kukuthi - yayikuphela kwendlela awayenokuthi afike kuyo - nangona wayekwisithili iJupita; ukanti wayebonakala ekhululekile ngokulula; Ukugcina okona kuphezulu; umxholo onobuhlobo bakhe; Hlala ulingana naye. Ngokuqinisekileyo le yayiyintanda yentanda-bulumko entle; Nangona ngokungathandabuzekiyo wayengazange weva ukuba kukho into enjalo. Kodwa, mhlawumbi, ukuba yintanda-bulumko yokwenyani, thina bantu akufuneki sizi kakuhle ukuphila okanye sibeleka njalo. Ke kaloku, xa ndisiva ukuba, umntu onjalo uhlela isithandi-sobulumko, ndigqiba kwelokuba, njengomfazi osele enodypeptic, umele ukuba &quot;aphule igadi yakhe.&quot;

       Ndikhe ndahlala apho kuloo gumbi lililolo; umlilo ovuthayo phantsi, kwelo nqanaba elithambileyo xa, emva kokuqina kwawo kokuqala kufudumeze umoya, emva koko ukhazimle kuphela ukuba ujongwe; I-shades zangokuhlwa kunye neeprojekhsing hlanganisa ezijikelezileyo zijikeleza amatyala, kwaye zihamba phezu kwethu Bonke, eyenziwe i-Sterwan. Isaqhwithi siyaphela ngaphandle kokugxothwa; Ndiqale ukuba nengqondo yeemvakalelo ezingaqhelekanga. Ndaziva ndinyibilika kum. Akuyi kuphinda zentliziyo yam ebiyelweyo kwaye isandla sam sajikwa kwihlabathi lelfish. Esi sithsaba esithobileyo sasikhulula. Apho wahlala, ngokungumphambukeli okuthetha ubuntu apho kungekho ngqwaziseko ngaphandle kwenkohliso kunye nenkohliso. Wayekho; umbono obonakalayo obonakalayo; Nangona kunjalo ndaye ndaziva ndinomdla wokuqiqa naye. Kwaye ezo zinto zazingafikeleleka abanye, zezo zigatya ezazinditsale. Ndiza kuzama umhlobo wobuhedeni, ndicinge, kuba ububele bobuKristu bubonakalise kodwa kukumkani. Nditsale ibhentshi yam kufutshane naye, ndenze imiqondiso enobuhlobo kunye neengcebiso, ukwenza konke okusemandleni am ukuthetha naye kwaphela. Okokuqala waphawula ukuba la manyathelo ahambelanayo; Kodwa ngoku, xa ndandibhekisa esibhedlele sakhe izolo ebusuku, wacela ukuba ndibuze ukuba siphinde sibubhedlele. Ndamxelela ewe; Hlobo ndacinga ukuba ubonakala uyonwabile, mhlawumbi unconywe kancinci.

       Sandula ke sayijika le ncwadi, ndaza ndazama ukumcacisela injongo yokuprinta, kunye nentsingiselo yemifanekiso embalwa eyayikuyo. Ngale ndlela kungekudala ndaba nomdla; Kwaye ukusuka kwinto esiya eJaberting elona lihle kangako esinokuthi sibe ngamagama ahlukeneyo angabonakaliyo ukuba abonwe kule dolophu idumileyo. Kungekudala ndaphakamisa umsi wentlalo; kwaye, evelisa isingxobo sakhe kunye ne-tomahawk, wathi cwaka wandinika ukufunxa.

       Ukuba ukanti kukhange nawuphi na umkhenkce wokungakhathali kum kwibele leheden, lo msi wethu obathandayo, kungekudala wawukhupha, wasishiya i-cronsies. Wayebonakala ngathi uza kuthatha ngokwam ngokwendalo kwaye angafakwanga njengam kuye; Xa umsi wethu ugqibile, wabuxhasa umbungu wam, wandibetha esinqeni, wathi, Ndathi, Ndathi, ndatsho ukuba sitshatile; intsingiselo, kwibinzana lelizwe lakhe, singabahlobo ababhinqileyo; Uya kundifela, ukuba kufuneka.

       Emva kwesidlo sangokuhlwa, enye ingxoxo nomsi, saya kwigumbi lethu kunye. Wandenzela umnikelo ngentloko yakhe; wakhupha isipaji sakhe esikhulu secuba, waphuthaphutha phantsi kwecuba, wakhupha amashumi amathathu eedola kwisilivere; emva koko wawandlala phezu kwetafile, waza wawahlula ngomatshini abe zizahlulo ezibini ezilinganayo, watyhalela enye yazo ngakum, yathi yeyam. Bendiya kukhanyisa; kodwa wandithulisa ngokuwagalela epokothweni yebhulukhwe yam. Ndibayeka bahlale. Emva koko waya malunga nemithandazo yakhe yangokuhlwa, wakhupha isithixo, wasusa ibhodi yebhodi. Ngemiqondiso ethile kunye neempawu, bendicinga ukuba wayebonakala endikhathalele ukuba ndihambe naye; Kodwa ukwazi ukuba yintoni eyayiza kulandela, ndachitha okomzuzwana ukuba, nokuba undimeme, ndiza kuthobela okanye ngenye indlela.

Kodwa yintoni unqulo? Ndacinga ukuba ndisazi, uIshmayeli, ukuba uThixo wezulu wezulu nomhlaba, onokubandakanywa yintshabalalo yenkuni emnyama? Ayinakwenzeka!

Ngenxa yoko, ndimele ndimanyanisa naye kuye; i-ergo, kufuneka ndijike i-idollator. Ndabandezela imithombo; incedise isithixo esingenatyala; wamnika i-biscuit entsha nge-wiscuqueg; imbiwa phambi kwakhe kabini okanye kathathu; Yanga impumlo yakhe; Kwaye loo nto yenzekile, sasivezekile kwaye saya kulala, uxolo ndinezazela zezethu nehlabathi liphela. Kodwa asizange silale ngaphandle kwengxoxo encinci.

Indoda nomfazi, bathi, Apho bavuleleke imiphefumlo yabo, omnye komnye; Kwaye ezinye izibini ezindala zihlala zixoka kwaye zincokole ngaphezulu kwexesha elidala kude kube sekupheleni kwentsasa. Ke, ke, entliziyweni yethu yeentliziyo zethu, ndibeka i-i kunye ne-teeequeg - isibini esipholileyo, isibini esinothando.

       Ewe, savuka kakhulu; Kakhulu ke ukuze isikhundla sethu sokuthintela kwethu sazidinisa, kwaye kancinane kwaye sincinci sizifumene sihleli phezulu; Iingubo zigculelwe kakuhle thina, simamele iBhodi yeNtloko ngamadolo asethu amadolo asondelelene, kwaye i-imples yethu ixhonywe phezu kwabo, ngokungathi igodi yethu yayiyimfazwe.

       Xa isikhumbuzo esitsha esibalekayo malunga ne-tible ye-humine yengca ejikelezayo, elandelwa ziibhokhwe eziphathwayo, ngokungathi ungumonga oluhlaza; Nangona kunjalo, emphefumlweni ka-Queequeg, wasondla umnqweno onamandla wokubona into engaphezulu kweNgqobhoko kune-qualer okanye ezimbini. Uyise waba yintloko enkulu, ukumkani; Umalusi wakhe umbingeleli omkhulu; Kwaye kwicala lentshukumo waqhayisa oomakazi ababengabafazi bamanye amajoni. Kwakukho igazi elibalaseleyo emithanjeni yakhe-izinto zasebukhosini; Nangona ndibuhlungu kakhulu, ndiyoyika, nge-cannibal kubunyani awondla ngolutsha olungengabo.

       Inqanawa ye-SAG Harbor yatyelela i-bay yakhe, kwaye iQueequeg yafuna indawo kumazwe angamaKristu. Ke umkhombe, wayenomkhonzazana wakhe opheleleyo, wathulula isuti yakhe; Kwaye ayingabo bonke uKumkani owayenempembelelo kayise. Kodwa uQueequeg wenza isifungo. Yedwa kwiphenyane lakhe, wasibeka kude kube sekude, owaziyo inqanawa kufuneka udlule xa wasiyeka eso siqithi. Kwelinye icala kwakukho uqaqa lwekorale; Kwelinye ulwimi lomhlaba, olugutyungelwe ziithanga le-mangrove elalikhula emanzini. Ndifihlile iphenyane lakhe, ndiseziloti, phakathi kwezi zilo zithatyathi, nolwandle lwalo lwaso, Wahlala phantsi, wasithobe phantsi; Uthe ke akubon&#39; ukuba udlula umkhombe, wesuka waphaphatheka; wafumana icala lakhe; Ngomqolo omnye wonyawo lwakhe, kwaye watshona iphenyane lakhe; nyuka amakhonkco; Kwaye uziphose ngobude obugcwele, ugalelwe umsesane-bolt phaya, kwaye wafunga ukuba angayivumeli, nangona itshixiwe.

       ABANDABI BENZA UMFANEKO WAYEZA UKUZE UVULE UKUZE UVULE UKUZE UVULE UKUZE UVULE; unqunyanyisiwe ukuba abe ngamaqhinga akhe kwiingone. I-Queeequeg yayingunyana wokumkani, kwaye iQueequequet yayingabi. Ukubethwa kukungathembani kwakhe, kwaye umnqweno wakhe wasendle wokutyelela iNgqobhoko, umphathi-phepha, waza wamxelela unokuzibeka ekhaya. Kodwa oku kutyibiliko oluhle-olu lwayensi lolwandle olwabemi, akazange abone ikhabhathi kaKapteni. Bambeka phakathi kwabakhephelayo, bawenza umthombo ongumnenga. Kodwa njengoCzar Petros wanelisekile kwi-Deil kwiinqanawa zenqanawa yezixeko ezisemzini, iQeeeequet yasuswa ngaphandle kokungabinamliseli, ukuba kunokwenzeka ukuba afumane amandla okuthi aqaqambe abantu abangenakukhanyisela abantu abaninzi abangafezekanga.

Kodwa, Yoha! Imikhwa ye-Whalemane yabadala yamenza wamenza ukuba amaKristu anokuba lusizi kwaye ongendawo; Okungapheliyo, ngaphezu kwabo bonke abahedeni bakayise. Ifike ekugqibeleni kwi-sag yezibuko; Kwaye ukuba babone ntoni oomatiloshe apho; kwaye emva koko ukuya eNantucket, kwaye bebona indlela abayichitha ngayo imivuzo yabo

       Ngentsasa elandelayo, ngoMvulo, emva kokulahla intloko yentloko kwi-barber, ibhloko, ndazinza eyam iBill; Ukusebenzisa, nangona kunjalo, imali yam ye-comrade. Umnini-mhlaba oGreyini, kunye nabakhweli, kubonakala ngathi bakhathazekile ngobuhlobo obukhawulezileyo obuye baphuma phakathi kwam ne-Queeequeg-ngakumbi njengeyona nto iphambili ngayo ngoku kunye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Siboleke amavili, siqala izinto zethu, kubandakanywa nebhegi yam ehluphekayo, kunye ne-queees sack, i-hamskeck ye-hamcket sepaker kwi-Wharf. Njengoko sasihamba nabantu babejonge; hayi kwi-Qieeequeg kakhulu-kuba babeqhele ukubona amantshontsho anjengaye ezitratweni, -Kodwa yena ngokumbona nam ngokwamagama anemfihlo. Kodwa asizithobelanga, siye sahambahamba ngeenyawo, kwaye sahamba nge-queequeg ngoku kwaye samisa emva koko siye sayilungisa i-sheath kwi-harbs yakhe. Ndambuza ukuba kutheni ephethe into enjalo kuye, nokuba zonke iinqanawa azifumananga iihemi zabo. Kule nto, kwinto, waphendula, ukuba nangona ndiyiphumeleleyo yayiyinyani, ukanti wayenomdla ongazenzisiyo ngorhatya bakhe, kuba wayezama ngokusondeleyo, kwaye esondeleyo kwiintliziyo ezininzi yeminenga. Ngamafutshane, njengabavuni abangenanzo zakudala nabathunywa, abangena emanganjeni kunye nezabo ze-scythes kunye nezizathu zabo, kodwa bathanda iredeya yakhe.

       Ukutshintsha i-board esandleni sam kuye, wandixelela ibali elihlekisayo malunga ne-heli yokuqala eyakhe yabona. Kwakwizibuko le-SAG Harbor. Abanini beenqanawa zakhe, kubonakala ngathi, banxamnye naye, apho ukuze baphathe isifuba sakhe esinzima kwindlu yakhe. Ukungabonakali nokungazi ngento leyo - nangona enyanisweni wayehlala enyanisekileyo, malunga nendlela echanekileyo yokulawula i-Barrow-Queeequeg ibeka isifuba sakhe kuyo; uyayiva ngokukhawuleza; kwaye ke amagxa avuthayo kwaye anyukele i-WORF. &quot;Kutheni,&quot; ndathi, &quot;I-Qieeequeg, unokuba wazi ngcono kunoko, umntu unokucinga. Ngaba abantu abahlekanga? &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Kule nto, wandixelela elinye ibali. Abantu besiqithi sakhe saseRokovoko, kubonakala ngathi, kwimithendeleko yabo yomtshato babonisa amanzi amancinanana e-cocoanuts emincinci kwi-calabash enkulu ene-calabash njenge-punchbowl; Kwaye le punchbowl ihlala iyenza umhombiso omkhulu obukhulu kumbane obalekayo apho umthendeleko ubanjiwe khona. Ngoku inqanawa ethile yomthengisi ebalaseleyo yakuba ichukumise iRokovoko, kwaye i-Commander yaso isuka kwi-Oppedial, lo myalelo wamenyelwa kumthendeleko we-queeeeeg, inkosazana entle ijika yeshumi. Kuhle; Xa zonke iindwendwe zomtshato zahlanganisana kwi-bamboo ye-qambo, lo mphathi ujikeleza, kwaye wabelwa isithuba sokubekwa ePunclowland, naphambi koMbingeleli oMkhulu nobungangamsha bukaMequequeg. UTHANDO OLUTHINIWEYO, kuba abantu abababalo lwabo kunye nabo - nangona i-queequeg yandixelela ukuba, njengamaxesha anjalo, abachasene ne-dacks, bebonke benyuka besiya kumnika Kuwo onke amadini - nditsho, kusithiwa, umbingeleli omkhulu uvula isidlo ngomsitho we-Imemoal Sterimol yesiqithi; Oko kukuthi, ukuntywila iminwe yakhe enikezelweyo kunye neyolisayo kwisitya ngaphambi kokuba isiphuzi esisikelelekileyo sijikeleza. Ukuzibona kwakhe kwathabathela kombingeleli, wawuphatha umsitho, nokucinga ngokwakhe, ukuba abe lilindle, ukuba abe lilindle, inkulumbuso yenkosi. ; -Themba ndicinga ukuba iglasi enkulu-yeglasi. &quot;Ngoku,&quot; yatsho i-Qieequeg, &quot;yintoni wena ngoku? -Ngaba bantu bethu bahleke?&quot;

    <p>
       Ekugqibeleni, isicatshulwa esihlawulelweyo, kunye nekhuselekile, sema ekuqhubeni i-Schonener. Ukuhamba ngenqanawa, yandithoba umlambo i-acchanet. Kwelinye icala, i-New Deded yaseBedford ye-terraund yezitrato, imithi yabo egqunywe ngumkhenkce yonke imnandi emoyeni ecacileyo, ebandayo. Iinduli ezinkulu kunye neentaba ze-casks kwimibane zafakwa kwimibane yakhe, ecaleni kwehlabathi-inqanawa ebhadula i-while ithe cwaka kwaye ikhuselekile ngokukhuselekileyo nangokukhuselekileyo; Ngelixa abanye bevela kwabanye beza nesandibazili kunye nabaphathi, ngengxolo yomlilo kwaye beyinyibilika i-pitch, konke ukubekwa inkqonkqo into eqaqambileyo; Esona siphelo sibe semngciphekweni omkhulu kunye nohambo olude, liqala kasibini; Kwaye okwesibini kwaphela, iqala kathathu, njalo njalo, ngonaphakade nangakumbi. Kukuphela kokuphele, ewe, ukulunga kwawo onke umgudu wasemhlabeni.

       Ukufumana amanzi avulekileyo, umoya ovuthuzayo ovuthuzayo omtsha; I-MOSS encinci yaphosa igwebu ngokukhawuleza kwiqubuliso, njengethole lenkohliso yakhe. Njani ukuba ndicaphukise indlela yeTartar! Ndiguqule ndiwuncome ubungangamsha bolwandle oluya kuvumela iirekhodi.

       Kula mfo-mboleko-mthobeni, iQeeequequeg labonakala ngathi lisela kwaye lindele kunye nam. Iimpumlo zakhe ezimnyama zadumba zahlukana; Wabonisa ifayile yakhe kunye namazinyo akhoyo. Ngaphezu koko, ndabaleka; nokwahlwaya kwethu, uMods waqubuda ekuqhubaneni; Phakanya kwaye sakhwela izaphetha sakhe njengekhoboka phambi kwecultan. Indlela yokuvala ikhompyutha, thina besecaleni sibodwa; zonke iintsontelo zikhenkceza njengocingo; Iimaski ezimbini ezinde zinebhotile njengee-Canes zase-India e-Indian kwi-Hornadoes. Ke ngokugcwele le meko ibanje, njengoko sasimi kwi-birrit yokufaka, ukuba kangangexesha elithile asizange siqaphele ukuba sibe semngciphekweni wabakhweli, i-LEBBER-i-LUBBER-efana nokuba babini banokuba neqabane; ngokungathi umntu omhlophe unento enesidima ukogqitha umntu olilungu elicakwe mhlophe. Kodwa kukho iibhobi kunye ne-bumpkins apho, ongubani, eluhlaza kakhulu, kumele ukuba ubuvela entliziyweni kunye neziko layo yonke i-verdare. I-Queequeg ibanjiwe enye yezi samba ezincinci zimlinganisa ngasemva. Ndacinga ukuba ilixa likaBumpkin lalifikile. Ukuhla i-harepoon yakhe, isijwili se-brawny simphathe ezingalweni saKhe, kwaye ngokuphefumla ngokungummangaliso kunye namandla, wamthumela phezulu emoyeni; Emva koko kancinane empomposani i-sterrset yayo, amanye amazwe ahamba ngemiphunga ezinyaweni zakhe, ngelixa umphezulu we-queequet, wasusa umbhobho wakhe waseTmahaw kwaye wandidlulisela kum.

       mnumzana,&quot; wakhala umphathi-ntsapho, umbambo wolwandle, ethanda ukuya kwi-Queequeg, &quot;uthetha ukuthini kwiindudumo? Anazi na ukuba ungayixhela le nto?
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Ithetha ntoni?&quot; uthe queequeg, njengoko waguqukela kum.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ithi,” ndatsho, “ukuba usondele ukubulala-e kulaa ndoda ilapho,” ndisalatha kuphondo oluluhlaza olusangcangcazelayo.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Bulala-e,&quot; wakhala-queeequeg, ejija ubuso bakhe ngetyhefu kwintetho engafunekiyo yokungakhathali, &quot;Ah! I-Besty Heay-Yintlanzi-K NE; I-Qieeequeg No Bade-e kancinane-e ntlanzi - e; I-Qieeequeg Babulala-E Big! &quot;

       kubulala-i-cannibal, ukuba uthe wazama ezinye zeefutha zakho apha; ndiyabona iliso lakho. &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa kwenzeke kanye, ukuba lilixesha lokuba umphathikazi uya khumbula iliso lakhe. Uxinzelelo lwe-prodigaus kumkhenkce ophambili lwahlukana nephepha lemozulu, kwaye i-boom enkulu ngoku yayiphaphazela ukusuka kwelinye icala, iphela ngokupheleleyo emva kwenxalenye yendawo yomgangatho. Umntu olihlwempu umntu olihlwempu ophethe i-queeeeg wayesingathelela rhabaxa, watshintshwa ngaphezulu kwebhodi; Zonke izandla zazinoloyiko; kunye nokuzama ukungqubana kwi-boom ukuhlala, kwabonakala ukuba ngqokelela. Ibaleka isuka ekunene ukuya ngasekhohlo, kwaye ibuye kwakhona, phantse emva kwewotshi yewotshi, kwaye zonke iimoto zabonakala zikwindawo yokutshiswa. Akukho nto yenziwayo, kwaye akukho nto ibonakala ngathi yenziwe; Abo bakwidesika bakhawuleza ukuya kwiiphenyane, kwaye bema ngokujonga ngokungathi ngumhlathi ongezantsi womnenga obangela umdla. Ephakathi kwesi sishwabi, i-Queeequet iphosa ngokungapheliyo emadolweni, kwaye ihamba phantsi kwentambo, ikhuphe enye i-rope, ikhuseleke enye njenge-lasso, ibanjiwe ijikeleze i-LOOM njengoko yayitshayela phezu kwentloko yakhe, kwaye kwijerk elandelayo, i-spar yayivaleleke ngaloo ndlela, kwaye konke kwakukhuselekile. I-Schoneko yaqhutywa emoyeni, kwaye ngelixa izandla zicima isikhephe, i-Qieeequeg, zihluthwe esinqeni, ezihamba ecaleni kwe-arc ende. Kwimizuzu emithathu okanye ngaphezulu wabonwa ukuqubha njengenja, ephosa iingalo zakhe ezinde phambi kwakhe, kwaye ngokucothisa i-brawny yakhe ngamaqhina akhe. Ndakhangela umfo ozukileyo nozukileyo, kodwa akuboni mntu ukuba usindiswe. IGreyhorn yayihla. Ukudubula ngokwakho emanzini, kwi-Queeequeueg, ngoku kuthathe ukuqaqamba kwangoko, kwaye kubonakala ngathi kubaluleke kangakanani na ukuba ziphantsi. Kaninzi imizuzu embalwa, kwaye wavuka kwakhona, ingalo enye isanda, kwaye enye itsalela ifom engenabomi. Kungekudala isikhephe sazikhupha. I-gompkin ihlwempu ibuyiselwe. Zonke izandla zivotelwe i-queeeeeg ixilongo; Umphathi wacela uxolo. Ukusuka kwelo lixa ndinamathela eQeeeequeg njengombambano; ewe, kude kube yi-queeeeeg ithathe i-dive yokugqibela yakhe ende.

       Ngaba lwalukho nje olungaqondakaliyo? Wayengabonakali ngathi ucinga ukuba konke konke ekuthethwe ngembasa ukusuka kubuntu obunobuntu nobukhuni. Wacela kuphela amanzi amatsha amanzi-into yokusula i-brine; Oko kwenjenjalo, wanxiba umbhobho weengubo, wawusombhobho, wagqobhoza iinqaba ezingqonge iingqongqo, ukuba uthethe naye, &#39;yilizwe liphela, kuyo yonke i-medotion. Iibhanti kufuneka zincede la maKristu. &quot;

       Ayikho into eyenzekayo kwisiqendu esifanelekileyo ukuchaza; Ke, emva kokuba abalekayo, sifike ngokukhuselekileyo eNantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
       I-NANECKET! Thatha imephu yakho kwaye uyijonge. Bona ukuba injani ikwindawo yehlabathi yehlabathi; Iphumile njani apho, kude nonxweme, aloloni ngakumbi kunendlu ye-Eddystone. Khangela, intaba, nengqiniba yentlabathi; lonke unxweme, ngaphandle kwemvelaphi. Kukho isanti engaphezulu apho ubuya kuyisebenzisa kwiminyaka engamashumi amabini njengendawo yokufaka iphepha lokucoca iphepha. Ezinye iintsilelo ezibalaseleyo ziya kukuxelela ukuba batyale ukhula apho, abakhuli ngokwemvelo; ukuba bangenisa iikonda zeCanada; ukuba kufuneka bathumele ngaphaya kweelwandle ukuze bayeke ukuvuza kwi-task yeoyile; ukuba iziqwenga zomthi eNantucket zithwalwa njengamasuntswana omnqamlezo wokwenyani eRoma; Abantu batya i-toadstosstosssssss phambi kwezindlu, bangene phantsi komthunzi ngehlobo lehlobo; I-blade enye yengca yenza i-oasis, amabala amathathu ngemini ahamba i-promorie; ukuba banxibe izihlangu eziphindayo, into efana ne-lapiker-izihlangu; ukuba bavalelwe, bavalelwa, zonke iindlela ezijikelezileyo, ezijikelezwe, kwaye zenza isiqithi solwandle, ukuze sifumane izitulo ezinamava, ngokungathi sisemva kwe-turtles saselwandle. Kodwa ezi roughvaganzas zibonisa kuphela ukuba i-nantucket ayizizo ze-illinois.

Kumaxesha ka-Amnan Times I-Englea ifunyazwe kwi-England entsha, yaza yathwala i-mindian yesana kwiitalene zakhe. Ngokuzila ngokuvakalayo abazali bambone umntwana wabo ukuba athathwe emanzini omninzi. Bazimisela ukulandela kwicala elinye. Ukuzibeka kwi-canoes yabo, emva kwesicatshulwa esiyingozi basifumana isiqithi, kwaye apho bafumana i-idati ye-Ivorry engenanto, -I-India Anindaba.
    </p>
    <p>
       Hayi indlela ekumangalisa ngayo ke, ukuba aba bantu baseNantucketer, bazalelwe elunxwemeni, befanele baye elwandle ukuze baziphilise! Baqala babamba i-crabs kunye neengqokelela kwisanti; balishumi elikhulileyo, baphuma ngomnatha weMackerel; abanamava ngakumbi, batyhala ngezikhephe baza babamba intlanzi yeentlanzi; Kwaye ekugqibeleni, ukuqalisa inqanawa yeenqanawa ezinkulu elwandle, kwakuphonononga eli lizwe lisenziyo; Beka ibhanti engaguqukiyo yokujikeleza ngeenxa zonke; ifakwe kwi-Berering yeBererin; kwaye kuwo onke amaxesha onyaka nakuzo zonke iilwandle zabhengeza imfazwe yanaphakade ngesona sihlwele sinamandla siphilayo esiye sasinda kumkhukula; kakhulu kakhulu kwaye uninzi lweentaba! Ukuba i-Mastodan, iMastodon-Wattodon, inxibe ezona zinto zinamandla zokungazi, ukuba iipawusi zakhe zizoyike ngakumbi kunoyolo olungenaloyiko kwaye luhlaselo olubi kakhulu lungoyiki.

Vumela iMelika yongeze iMexico eTexas, kwaye ifumbe iCuba phezu kweCanada; Vumela isiNgesi i-Overdorm yonke i-India, kwaye ixhoma isibhengezo sabo esivuthayo elangeni; Isibini kwisithathu seli jiko ye-terraequed yi-nanticketer&#39;s. Ngokuba ngowakhe ulwandle, unetyala, njengabalawuli bakho. enye ityheli ukuba inelungelo ngaphaya koko. Iinqanawa zomthengisi ziyibhulorho; Abaxhobileyo kodwa badlala iinqaba; Nokuba bathabathele ipirates nabathengi, nakuba belandela ulwandle, babe ngakwindlela, baphanga ezinye iinqanawa, ezinye iziqwenga zelizwe zifana nabo, zingafuni nokutsala abantu abangenasiphelo.

      <i>

       lies his business, which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of

       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”

       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
