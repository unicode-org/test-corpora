       Kwindawo yokuqala, iiwindows ezinkulu zokusika, phakathi kwezinye izinto zexabiso ezibandakanya iqela leebhloko ezibandakanya uluhlaza luhlaza, kwaye akukho mntu ungatshatanga onokuthi aphakanyiswe ukuya kuthi ga kwi-TOP ephezulu kwaye athambekele kwi Intloko ye-SEAD ye-SOST, inqaku elinamandla naphi na ngaphezulu kwenqanawa yenqanawa. Ukuphela kwe-hawser-njengokutsala umoya ngolu hlobo lwentsundu, emva koko kwenziwa kwi-windows, kwaye ibhloko enkulu ye-tackles yaxutywa ngaphezulu komnenga; Kule bhloko i-blubber enkulu ye-blubber, enobunzima obunye beepawundi, kuqhotyoshelwe. Kwaye ngoku unqunyanyisiwe kumanqanaba ngaphezulu kwecala, i-stubble kunye ne-stubb, amaqabane, axhobise imingxunya yabo, aqalisa ukusika umngxunya womzimba we-Hought ngaphezulu kwecala eliphezulu. Oku kwenziwe, umgca ebanzi, i-semicircular unqunyulwe umngxunya, igwegwe ifakwe, kunye nomzimba ophambili weqela elibeka ikwayara yasendle, ngoku iqalisa ukuphosa isihlwele esinye esinemimoya. Ke ngoko nangoko, wonke umkhwenyana ujikeleza ecaleni kwakhe; Yonke i-bolt xa iqala njengeentloko zendlu yendlu kwimozulu yemozulu; Uyanyikima, nemiphefumlo etyhafileyo, Ngakumbi nangakumbi esenza iminenga, ngelixa yonke loo nto ijijekile imbambano iphendulwa ngumnikelo wokuzalwa ovela kunxweme; Kude kube sekupheleni, i-snap ekhawulezayo, iviwe i-snap iviwe; Ngenqanawa enkulu jika inqanawa ihamba phezulu nasemva komnenga, kwaye i-Triumbant inyuka iye kwi-semicircular yokutsala emva komtya wokuqala we-bebber. Ngoku njengemvulophu e-blubber i-whale ngokuchanekileyo njengoko i-rind yenza i-orenji, kunjalo, isuswe emzimbeni njengoko i-orenji ngamanye amaxesha ihluthiwe ngokuchitha. Kuba i-trin ihleli iqhubeka ngumthombo womoya rhoqo igcina umnenga uqengqeleka phezu kwamanzi, kwaye njenge-blubber kwi-bils enye ye-dismilt ebizwa ngokuba yi-scades enye ye-starbuck kunye ne-stubb, amaqabane; kwaye ngokukhawuleza njengokuba kunjalo, kwaye ngenxa yoko, ngenxa yoko, ngalo lonke ixesha lixhonywe ngaphezulu kwaye liphezulu kakhulu de kuphele ngaphezulu; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it Inokuba ibhokisi iindlebe zakhe kwaye ikhuphe intloko engaphezulu.

       Omnye wabaHarponey abaya kwiHarponers ngoku baqhubela phambili, besithi, besengozini ebizwa ngokuba yikrele, kwaye bebukele ithuba lakhe, besenza umngxunya obonakalayo kwinxalenye esezantsi. Kulomngxunya, ukuphela kwento yesibini yokutshintsha i-teckle ikhutshiwe ukuze igcinwe i-Blubber, ukuze ilungiselele okulandelayo. I-Firesmman yeqhina, isilumkiso sezandla ezifezekileyo, xa sele senze i-dash yesayensi ngobunzima, kwaye eneembophelelo ezimbalwa, zinqweneleka, zityale i-Teriin; Ukuze ukuba inxenye yenxalenye engezantsi isakhawuleza, umtya omde ophambili, obizwa ngokuba yingubo yengubo, kwaye ulungele ukuthoba. Umrhumo ngaphambili ngoku qalisa kwakhona ingoma yabo, kwaye ngelixa enye iwile kwaye ithe theka umtya wesibini ukusuka kumnenga, enye ihamba kancinci, ihamba i-hatch yokuqala ye-hatflor ebizwa ngokuba yiyo igumbi le-blubber. Kwezi freyment futry sundry sundry zezandla ziqhubeka ziyiqeshele ingubo ende-i-biby-pire ngokungathi yinto enkulu ephilayo yeenyoka ezibekiweyo. Kwaye ke umsebenzi uqhubeka; Iiwindows ezimbini zithetha nokuthoba ngaxeshanye; Zombini zomnenga nomoya, umrhumo oculayo, igumbi le-Blubber-igumbi lokuthoba, amaqabane athambileyo, kwaye zonke izandla zityhafisa ngamaxesha athile, ngendlela yokuphambana ngokubanzi.

       Andikhange ndinike ingqwalasela encinci kweso sifundo singenakuguqulwa, isikhumba somnenga. Ndinempikiswano ngayo kunye ne-Whalemen enamava e-faleloat, kwaye wafunda indalo elunxwemeni. Uluvo lwam lwantlandlolo luhlala luguqukile; Kodwa lumvo kuphela.
    </p>
    <p>
       Umbuzo ngulo, yintoni kwaye luphi ulusu lomnenga? Sele uyazi ukuba i-blubber yakhe. Laa blubha yinto yokuhambelana kwenyama yenkomo eqinileyo, esondeleleneyo, kodwa yomelele, inwebeka ngakumbi kwaye ixinene, kwaye isuka kwisibhozo okanye ishumi ukuya kwishumi elinesibini kunye neshumi elinesihlanu i-intshi ubukhulu.
    </p>

       Ngoku, nokuba ibubuvuvu kangakanani na ekuqaleni isenokubonakala ithetha ngalo nasiphi na isidalwa solusu njengolo hlobo lokungqinelana nobukhulu, kanti enyanisweni ezi ayizizo iingxoxo ezichasene nentelekelelo enjalo; Kuba awukwazi ukuphakamisa nayiphi na into egqubutheleyo emzimbeni womnenga womnenga kodwa ibleber enye; Kwaye eyona nto iphambili emthunzini waso nasiphi na isilwanyana, ukuba sinengqondo, inokuba yintoni le nto kodwa ulusu? Kuyinyani, ukusuka kwi-Nouse engatshatanga yomnenga, unokuzikhupha ngesandla sakho umntu ophantsi kakhulu, obonakalayo, ngandlela ithile efana ne-onreds ecekeceke, kuphela eguqukayo kwaye uthambile njengoko i-satin; Oko kukuthi, ngaphambili ukomiswa, xa kungabikho kuphela izivumelwano kunye neebhulukhwe, kodwa ziya kuba nzima. Ndineqela elinemilo eyomileyo elomileyo, endiyisebenzisayo kumanqaku kwincwadi yam ye-Whale.

Ngalo naliphi na ixesha, kuyathandeka ukufunda malunga neminenga ngokwabo imingxunya, njengoko unokuthi. Kodwa into endiqhuba ngayo apha yile. Le nto incinci icekeceke, i-Illinglass into, ethi, ndiyavuma, ingenisa wonke umzimba womnenga, akunjalo ulusu lwesidalwa, ukuze sithethe; Kuba yayihlekisa nje ukuthi, ukuba ulusu olufanelekileyo lwe-qulesturl lube mncinci kwaye lunethamsanqa ngaphezu kolusu lomntwana osakulwelwe. Kodwa akusekho koku.

       Ebomini, umphezulu obonakalayo we-Spele Whale ayisiyeyona mincinane phakathi kwabamangalisayo abaninzi abazinikezela. Phantse ngokungaguqukiyo konke kukufuphi nokuwela ngokufihlakeleyo kwaye uwele amanqaku athe tye engenamagama, into efana nezo kwezona zibalaseleyo zomgca we-Itali. Kodwa la manqaku abonakali ngathi achukunyiswe kwinto esetyenziswayo ichazwe ngasentla, kodwa kubonakala ngathi uyabonakala ngayo, ngokungathi bakrolwe emzimbeni. Kwaye ayisiyiyo yonke le nto. Kwezinye iimeko, kwiliso elikhawulezayo, elinoqwalaselo, loo manqaku angqameneyo, njengakwimikrolo yokwenyani, kodwa anike umhlaba kwezinye iinkcazelo ezikude. Ezi yi-hieroglyphical; Oko kukuthi, ukuba ubiza loo cyphe yabo abangaqhelekanga kwiindonga zephiramidi hieroglyphics, ke elo liLizwi elifanelekileyo lokusebenzisa kwi-qubionsion yangoku.

Njengaloo mpahla yemfihlakalo, nayo, umnenga ophawulekileyo ophawulelwe ungafezeki. Olu tshintsho kumatye aseIndiya abakhumbuza ngenye into. Ngaphandle kwayo yonke enye into engaphandle ye-Speile Sures, akafane abonakalise umva, ngakumbi inxenye yakhe ebonakalayo, ngenxa ye-scratct ye-rude eqhelekileyo, iphela engaqhelekanga, iphela Inqaku. Kufanele ukuba nditsho ukuba la matye amatsha eNgilane kunxweme lolwandle, apho iingcinga zeAgassiz zinokuthwala uphawu lokudibana nonxibelelwano oluvuthayo-kufuneka, ukuba amatye angabi nakufana ne-spele shale incinci. Kwakhona kubonakala kum ukuba imikrwelo enjalo kwi-whale mhlawumbi yenziwa kukudibana okuchasayo kunye neminye iminenga; kuba ndiye ndaphawula kubo kwiinkunzi ezinkulu, ezikhule ngokupheleleyo zodidi.

I-whale ingenisa i-blubber yakhe njengengubo okanye i-overpane; Okanye, isenokubangcono, i-Indian Ponho Slip kwintloko yakhe, kwaye inomtsalane isiphelo sakhe.

Ngelixa, njengomntu, umnenga unemiphunga kunye negazi elifudumeleyo. Yikhulule igazi lakhe, kwaye uyafa. Hayi indlela emnandi ngayo ke ngaphandle kwengcaciso - ukuba le monster inkulu, leyo ifudumeleyo efudumeleyo ibalulekile njengoko kunjalo emntwini; Hayi indlela emangalisa ngayo ukuba afumaneke ekhaya, abhaptize emilebeni yakhe ebomini kula manzi iArctic! apho, xa oomatiloshe bewela phezu kwenqanawa, maxa wambi bafunyanwa, kwiinyanga emva koko, bekhenkceke ngokuthe ngqo kwiintliziyo zamasimi omkhenkce, njengoko impukane ifunyanwa incamathele kwi-amber. Kodwa kuyamangalisa ngakumbi ukuba ukwazi, njengoko kungqinelwa luvavanyo, ukuba igazi lomnenga onesiporho lishushu kunelo ye-borneo ehlotyeni.

       &quot;Aye? Ewe, ngoku, oko kukukhahlile, &#39;wakhalaza ngequbuliso uAhabhi, ngelixa egcwele amafu egalelekile ebusweni bakhe. &quot;Oko kukhala ngokuDlala ekuthethelweni okubulalayo kunokutshintsha indoda engcono. - Apho phi?

       &quot;Amanqaku amathathu kwibhonde yebhodi yebhodi eqhekezayo, Mnumzana, kunye nomoya ovuthuzayo!

       &quot;Kungcono kwaye ungcono, umntu. Bekuya kuza ngoku, ukungavuzwa kwam kuzisa umoya wam ovuthuzayo. O Imvelo, kwaye o umphefumlo womntu! Kukungabikho ngaphaya kwayo yonke i-chaidalogues yakho! Ayisiyo i-atom encinci okanye ubomi, kodwa ngaba ubuqili bayo buphindezela engqondweni. &quot;

       ISAHLUKO 71. Ibali likaYerobhoham.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Isandla sibambene, kwavuthuza inqanawa nomoya; Kodwa umoya ovuthuzayo weza ngokukhawuleza kunomkhombe, kwaye kungekudala i-pequod yaqala ukrolwa.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngomgama weglasi yezikhephe zomntu wasemzini kunye neentloko ezingumntu zibonisa ukuba zihamba ngomnenga. Kodwa njengoko wayeneminyaka elikhulu kakhulu, edubula ngokuthi, ngokubonakala esenza indinyana emntwini othile, iPequed yayingenathemba lokufikelela kuye. Ke umqondiso wawusekelwe ukuze ubone ukuba iyakwenziwa njani impendulo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nantsi loo nto, ngathi ziinqanawa zemikhosi yasemkhosini, iinqanawa zezindlu ze-Whale zaseMelika zinomqondiso wabucala; Zonke izinto ezibonisa ukuba zibhalwe kwincwadi kunye namagama eenqanawa ezahlukeneyo eziqhotyoshelweyo, wonke umphathi unikiwe kuyo. Ngale ndlela, amagosa omnenga anikwe amandla ukuba aqonde ulwandle, nkqu nakumgama omfutshane kwaye akukho ndawo incinci.
    </p>
    <p>
       Umqondiso kaPequeod wawokugqibela wasabela ngowasemzini wakhe; engqine inqanawa ukuba ibe nguJerobhoham yeNantucket. Ukugrumba iiyadi zakhe, wehla, wajikeleza ngaphantsi kwe-Pequod&#39;s lee, wehlisa isikhephe; Kungekudala basondela; Kodwa, njengoko ileli esecaleni yayingqongwe ngu-odolo lwe-starbuck ukulungiselela umphathi-ntsapho wokundwendwela, owasemzini ekuthiwa wasibeka isandla sakhe emngxunyeni wesikhephe. Kwavela ukuba uYerobhoham wayenegumbi elinamanga elingenayo ebhodini, kwaye loo mfazi, wayoyika ukomeleza inkampani yePequed. Kuba, nangona wayekho kunye nabasebenzi abahamba ngenqanawa engazange bahlale bengabolukakanga. Ukanti xambelela ngokungathandabuzekiyo ukuba nengxaki yomhlaba, wayengazange avume ukuba adibane ne-pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa oku akwenziwanga ngaphandle kokuthintela lonke unxibelelwano. Ukugcina ixesha lokuphumla kweeyadi ezimbalwa phakathi kwalo kunye nenqanawa kaJerobhoham ngokusetyenziswa kwamaxesha athile okuqhutywa kwi-pequons, njengoko kunjalo nangoku ngelo xesha kuvuthulula kakhulu), I-top-tosack engaqhelekanga; nangona, eneneni, ngamanye amaxesha ngokuqalisa ngequbuliso kwamaza amakhulu aqengqelekayo, isikhephe sasiya kutyhalelwa phambili ngandlel’ ithile; Kodwa kungekudala ngekaziswe ngobuchule kwiibhere zayo ngokufanelekileyo. Ngokuxhomekeke koku, kunye nezinye iziphazamiso ezifanayo ngoku kwaye, incoko yaxhaswa phakathi kwala maqela mabini; kodwa ngezithuba ngaphandle kolunye uphazamiseko lolunye uhlobo olwahluke kakhulu.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ukutsala isikhephe sikaJerobhowam, wayeyindoda ebonakala emzimbeni, kwangabo bonke ubomi obusendle apho ubugqwirha buphi na. Wayengumntu omncinci, omfutshane, oselula, wafafazwa ebusweni bakhe kunye ne-freckles, kwaye unxibe iinwele ezityhefu. Idyasi eneskirt eside, esikwe ngokwecabalistic ye-walnut tinge efileyo yamgquma; Imikhono esemagqabini ehamba ngeenyawo. Inzululwazi enzulu, ihleli, i-faticic delirium yayisekupheleni kwakhe.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kungekudala eli nani lalifudula lifunekile, i-Stubb yakhwaza- &quot;nguYe! Yiyo! -I-scarmomo enesidima ende inkampani yedolophu yasixelela yona! &quot; Phantse apha kubhekiswa kwibali elingaqhelekanga elixelwe nguYarobheham, nomntu othile phakathi kwabasebenzi bakhe, xa kwakusandulela idolophu yasePequen, yathetha idolophu yasePeque. Ngokwale ngxelo kwaye kwakufuneka emva koko kwakufundwa kamva, kwabonakala ngathi i-scaramomac ekufumaneni inyhweba enomdla kakhulu kuyo wonke umntu kwiJerobhoham. Ibali lakhe le:
    </p>
    <p>
       Wayekhuliswe ekuqaleni phakathi koluntu oluphambeneyo lweNeskyeuna Shakers, apho wayengumprofeti omkhulu; Kwiintlanganiso zabo eziqhekekileyo, ezifihlakeleyo ukuba uninzi lwehla ukusuka ezulwini ngendlela yomgibe wegini, evakalisa ukuvulwa ngokukhawuleza kwe-vial yeshumi lesixhenxe, awayeyiphethe ipokotho; kodwa, endaweni yokuba iqulethe umpu, kwakufanele ukuba ihlawuliswe ngelaudanum. Wambatha umntu omangalisayo, wabapostile whim, wayemkile eNekyeuuna yeNantuncket, apho engaphandle, eqinile, waza wazinikela njengohambo oluhlaza lweJeroboham. Bambambile; kodwa kwaoko inqanawa yakuba isuke emhlabeni, kwasuka impambano yakhe. Wazixela njengengelosi enkulu kaGabliyeli, walela umphathi ukuba atsibe ngaphezulu. Wapapasha i-Intelostoto, apho wazibeka khona njengoMhlanguli weziqithi zolwandle ne-vist-gesticarga. Ukunyaniseka okungafunekiyo, awazenzayo; Imo yengqondo yobungcwele. Ngapha koko, babemoyika. Njengokuba indoda enjalo, nangona kunjalo, ayizange isebenziseke kakhulu emkhombeni, ngakumbi njengoko wayengavumiyo ukusebenza ngaphandle kokuba ethandana, babengazange baphelelwe nguye. kodwa yafumanisa ukuba injongo yaloo mntu yayikukumbeka kwizibuko lokuqala elimlungeleyo, isiphatha-zingelosi ngoko nangoko savula onke amatywina neengqayi zaso—sinikela inqanawa nazo zonke izandla ekutshatyalalisweni ngokungenamiqathango, ukuba kunokwenzeka oko kufezwe. Wabasebenza ngokophula elowo phakathi kwabasebenzi, ukuba ekugqibeleni, baya emzimbeni, baya emqayilweni, baya emqambini, emfuneni, ukuba uGabriyeli wathunyelwa emkhombeni, kodwa ingenguye umntu wabo. Wanyanzelwa ukuba arhoxile icebo lakhe. Bengayi kuvumela uGabriel ukuba abe yindlela egxile kuyo, athi okanye enze into awayeya kwenza; Yathi iGabriyeli yayinenkululeko epheleleyo yenqanawa. Isiphumo sayo yonke le nto, ukuba isiphatha-siPhakali sikhathazekile sincinci okanye akukho nto yomphathi kunye namaqabane; Kwaye ekubeni iqhekezwe ngubhubhane, waphatha isandla kunangaphambili; ivakalisa ukuba isibetho, njengoko wasibizayo, waye myalelo. kananjalo ayigcini, kodwa eyonwabileyo yakhe. Oomatiloshe, ubukhulu becala ziidemon zihlwempu, ezinye zazo, ezinye zazo zabeleka phambi kwakhe; Ngokuthobela imiyalelo yakhe, ngamanye amaxesha bamnikela ngembeko, njengoThixo. Ezo zinto zisenokubonakala ngathi ziyamangalisa; Kodwa, nangona kunjalo, nangona kunjalo, nangona yamangalisa, iyinyani. Kananjalo ayisiyo imbali ye-ntliziyo esisiqingatha sokubetha ngenxa yokuzithobela ngokungazenzisiyo kwiintliziyo ezingezela, njengamandla akhe okulahlekisa kunye nokugungqa kwabanye. Kodwa lixesha lokubuyela ePequod.
    </p>
    <p>
       Andindoyiki u-Ahabhi, kwathiwa, U-Ahabhi, engazange angoyiki u-Ahabhi. &quot;Yiza ebhodini.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Kodwa ngoku uGabriyeli waqala iinyawo zakhe.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Cinga, cinga ngodonga, tyheli kwaye ungonwabanga! Lulumkele isibetho esoyikisayo! &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;UGabriel! UGabriel! &quot; I-Capten yakhala itshoyo, &quot;Nakufuneka&quot; kodwa kwangoko umkhombe wasityela isikhephe esihamba phambili, kwaye ukufika kwayo kuhamba intetho yonke.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Uyibonile i-whale emhlophe?&quot; wacela uAhabhi, xa isikhephe sibuyile.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Cinga, cinga ngesikhephe sakho somnenga, esigculelwe kwaye sitshonile! Wulumkele lo msila umbi!”
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Ndikuxelela kwakhona, uGabriel, lowo-&quot; Kodwa kwakhona isikhephe esiya kutsalwa ngaphambi kokuba kutshelwe ngamafutha. Akukho nto yayithethwa ngamanye amaxesha, ngelixa ukulandelelana kwamaza e-riotous eqengqeleka, engomnye wabapapashi omalunga namaxesha athile olwandle babekhusela. Ngeli xesha, intloko ye-Wihla yeHomer Shale yagxeka ngogonyamelo, kwaye uGabriel wabonakala etshisekile ngakumbi ukuba esonakeleyo ngakumbi kunendalo ye-Archangel kwabonakala ngathi yimvume.
    </p>
    <p>
       Xa le ngxowa-mali yayiphezulu, uKapteni wama-Captan wamanye waqala ibali elimnyama malunga ne-moby dick; Akunjalo, nangona kunjalo, ngaphandle kokuphazamiseka rhoqo kuGabriel, xa igama lakhe lakhankanywa, kwaye ulwandle oluhlekisayo olubonakala luye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kwabonakala ngathi uYerobhoham akazange abuyele kude nekhaya, xa ekuthetheni umkhombe-nqanawa, abantu bakhe baphulukana nobukho be-moby dick, kwaye unesiphako awayelwenzile. Ukuncancisa kakhulu kobu bukhali, uGabriel walumkisa umphathi nxamnye nomnenga omhlophe, nokuba inyamakazi ibonakale; Kwibandlakala yakhe ebambeleyo, ukubiza umkhomo omhlophe ukuba ungabi ngaphantsi komthumeli uThixo obekiwe; Abafazi bafumana iBhayibhile. Kodwa nini, unyaka okanye ezimbini emva koko, uMickick Dick wayejongiswene kakuhle kwintloko engathunyelwanga, i-macey, iqabane eliyintloko, latshisa nge-Ardor ukuya kumkhawulela; Kwaye abaKapa babengakholelwa kuye ukuba bamyeke ukuba afumane ithuba, ngaphandle kwako konke ukuphelisa izinto zakudala kunye nabangasekhoyo, u-Macey waphumelela ekuphembelelani amahlanu kwisikhephe esimashumi mahlanu esikhepheni sakhe. Watyhalela nabo; Kwaye, emva kokutsala okuninzi, kwaye uninzi lwezinto eziyingozi, olungaphumelelanga, ekugqibeleni waphumelela ukufumana isinyithi esinye ngokukhawuleza. Okwangoku, uGabriel, wenyuka ukuya kwiNtloko eyintloko yasebukhosini, wayephosa inkulu kwi-Royal Somast, wayephosa engalo kwi-mormas ephambili kwizimbo zomzimba onamandla, kwaye akhangele iziprofetho zokungabinamsebenzi ongonwabanga. Ngoku, ngelixa i-macey, iqabane, laliphakamile isaphetha sakhe esiphelweni, kwaye onke amandla aphesheya kwesizwe sakhe yayivelela kwiminenga yakhe ebonakalayo, yabona! isithunzi esimhlophe esimhlophe esivela elwandle; Ngokukhawuleza, ukushukuma kwayo, ukuphefumla okwethutyana kwimizimba yeaarmen. Ngokulandelayo, iqabane elingenayo iqabane, lizaliswe ngobomi bomsindo, laxabana emzimbeni, kwaye wenza i-Arc emdelini, wawa elwandle kumgama omalunga namashumi amahlanu eeyadi ezingamashumi amahlanu. Hayi i-chip yesikhephe ihonjiswe, okanye nonwele lwalo naliphi na intloko ye-ongu; Kodwa iqabane lakhe liphelile.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kukulunga ukuba ngumzali apha, ezona zengozi ezibulalayo kwishishini lokuloba iSpem-Whale, olu hlobo mhlawumbi mhlawumbi lungasoloko lusenziwa rhoqo. Ngamanye amaxesha, akukho nto indenzakeleyo kodwa umntu obhubhiswayo ngenxa yoko; Kananjalo isaphetha sesaphetha somkhombe inkqonkqoze, okanye igumbi lendlu yasethanga, apho umntu wasethanga limi khona, iqwengile endaweni yayo kwaye ihamba nomzimba. Kodwa ukuqiqa kwayo yonke imeko, ukuba kwiimeko ezingakumbi kunoko, xa sele umzimba uphoswe, akukho phawu lube lulukhuni; indoda ifile ngoku.
    </p>
    <p>
       Yonke intlekele, ngohlobo lokuwa kwe-macey, yayikufuphi ngokucacileyo kwinqanawa. Ukukhulisa ukubhoboza- &quot;i-vial! Vial! &quot; UGabriel wakhupha abasebenzi abangamaqela enzonzobila ukusuka ekuzingelweni komnenga. Lo msitho ombi wambesa ingelosi enkulu ngempembelelo eyongeziweyo; Ngenxa yokuba abafundi bakhe abathembekileyo bekholelwa ukuba uxele ngokuthe ngqo, endaweni yokuba siphilise kuphela isiprofetho ngokubanzi, nto leyo enokuba yenze omnye, kwaye ke kuhamba inqaku elinye kwi-maspgin ebanzi evunyelwe. Waba yisothuso esingenagama kwinqanawa.
    </p>
    <p>
       U-Wabhi wagqiba kwelokuba aqhumisele kuye, uAhabhi wayibeka kuye loo mibuzo, ukuba lowo wasebukhosini akakwazanga ukucela ukubuza ukuba ufuna ukulingela i-Whinele MWO, ukuba ithuba kufuneka linikezele. UAhabhi waphendula wathi, “Ewe.” Kwangoko ke ke, uGabriel waphinda waqalisa iinyawo zakhe, waza wancuma kwixhego, enomnwe ongezantsi- &quot;Cinga, cinga, cinga khona!&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Watyibilika uAhabhi; Wathi ke uBhareya, Ndizicikize ngengxowa yam; Kukho ileta yelinye lamagosa akho, ukuba andikuphoxekanga. Starbuck, jonga ngaphezulu kwebhegi. &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Yonke inqanawa yenqanawa ikhupha inani elilungileyo lonobumba kwiinqanawa ezahlukeneyo, ezinikezela kubantu abanokuthi babhekiswe kuzo, kuxhomekeka kwithuba lokuhlangana Ngenxa yoko, uninzi lweeleta alufumaneni uphawu lwazo; kwaye uninzi lufunyenwe kuphela emva kokufumana iminyaka emibini okanye emithathu okanye ngaphezulu.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kungekudala i-Starbuck ibuyele ngoonobumba esandleni sakhe. Kwakuqhekezwa kakhulu, kuthotywa, kwaye igutyungelwe sisidenge, ibala, eluhlaza, isiphumo sokugcinwa kwilokhi emnyama yekhabhathi. Ngeleta enjalo, ukufa kwakhe kusenokuba yayingumfana emva kwenkwenkwe.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Awukwazi ukuyifunda?” UAhabhi wakhalaza. &quot;Ndinike, mntu. I-Aye, i-AYE, yi-scrawl ye-dim;--Yintoni le? Njengoko wayeyifunda, i-Starbuck yathatha isibonda esincinci sokusika-spade, kwaye ngempuphu yakhe iqhekekile isiphelo, ukufaka ileta apho, kwaye ngaloo ndlela, yiza nakwesikhephe kwinqanawa .
    </p>
    <p>
       Ngeli xesha uAhabhi ephethe ileta, &quot;Mnu. Har-Ewe, Mnu. Harry- (isandla somfazi, inkosikazi yendoda, ndiza kuyifumana) -ee-MR. UHarry Macey, nqanawa uYarobheham; -kukiswa yi-macey, kwaye ufile! &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Msgstr &quot;&quot; &quot;Umntu olihlwempu! Umntu osweleyo! Nasemka naye, wathi: Kodwa mandibe nayo. &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Hayi, lungiselela,&quot; wadanduluka uGabriyeli kuAhabhi; “thou art soon going that way.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck&#39;s hands, he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship&#39;s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel&#39;s eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab&#39;s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
       As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair.

       CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale&#39;s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster&#39;s back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Being the savage&#39;s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale&#39;s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the ship&#39;s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
       It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to Queequeg&#39;s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.
    </p>
    <p>
       So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another&#39;s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg&#39;s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*
    </p>
    <p>
       *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
    </p>
    <p>
       And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg&#39;s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
    </p>
    <p>
       Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
    </p>
    <p>
       But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. “Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you please.” Then watching the mate&#39;s countenance, he added, “The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we&#39;ll teach you to drug a harpooneer; none of your apothecary&#39;s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the captain&#39;s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a whale.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don&#39;t hit him again, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that sort; and this fellow&#39;s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity&#39;s gift, and that was freely given to the waves.

       CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk over Him.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale&#39;s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod&#39;s side. But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats, Stubb&#39;s and Flask&#39;s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel&#39;s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale&#39;s body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock.
    </p>
    <p>
       At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he turned upon his back a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
       While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation ensued between them.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat&#39;s bow, “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale&#39;s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale&#39;s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
       “I don&#39;t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he seems to know all about ships&#39; charms. But I sometimes think he&#39;ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don&#39;t half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake&#39;s head, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship? He&#39;s the devil, I say. The reason why you don&#39;t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he&#39;s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “He sleeps in his boots, don&#39;t he? He hasn&#39;t got any hammock; but I&#39;ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No doubt, and it&#39;s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye see, in the eye of the rigging.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bargain?—about what?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he&#39;ll surrender Moby Dick.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I don&#39;t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, &#39;I want John.&#39; &#39;What for?&#39; says the old governor. &#39;What business is that of yours,&#39; says the devil, getting mad,—&#39;I want to use him.&#39; &#39;Take him,&#39; says the governor—and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn&#39;t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I&#39;ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp—ain&#39;t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let&#39;s get the whale alongside.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship, “but I can&#39;t remember where.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn&#39;t the devil live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral&#39;s cabin, don&#39;t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that&#39;s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod&#39;s hold, and string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn&#39;t begin to be Fedallah&#39;s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn&#39;t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he&#39;s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me that?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But he&#39;d crawl back.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and drown you—what then?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I should like to see him try it; I&#39;d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn&#39;t dare to show his face in the admiral&#39;s cabin again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I&#39;m afraid of the devil? Who&#39;s afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn&#39;t catch him and put him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he&#39;d roast for him? There&#39;s a governor!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do I suppose it? You&#39;ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going on, I&#39;ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look here, Beelzebub, you don&#39;t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I&#39;ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he&#39;ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Didn&#39;t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you&#39;ll soon see this right whale&#39;s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti&#39;s.”
    </p>
    <p>
       In good time, Flask&#39;s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale&#39;s head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke&#39;s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant&#39;s and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.
    </p>
    <p>
       In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale&#39;s head, and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee&#39;s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab&#39;s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.
