Ergo gravis est corona quam porto? Corona Ferrea Lombardiae. Multis tamen splendet gemma; Velatos ego non videam fulgores ejus ; sed in aenigmate quod portem, obumbrat.

O dura! quod alios incendat, par ipsa pereat necesse est! Quod ausi, volui; et quod volui, faciam! Cogitant me insanum—Starbuck facit; sed daemoniacus sum, insanior insanio.

Finem impium videre videor; sed sentiet me illum adiuvandum esse. Nolo ego, ni ego, res ineffabilis illi me ligavit; tows me fune non habeo cultrum incidere. Horrendum senem!

       CAPITULUM 41. Moby Dick.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Ego Ismael unus ex turba illa; ascenderant clamores mei cum ceteris; iusiurandum cum illis iuncta est; et plus clamavi, et plus percutiebam et adstringebam prae timore animae meae. Horrida, mystica, compatiens in me fuit; Inimicibile Achab odium meum videbatur. Auis auribus didici historiam monstri parricidialis in quem ego et omnes alii violentiae et ultionis iuraverant.
    </p>
    <p>
       Aliquando antea, sed interiectis tantum, incomitatus balaenam albam seclusam occupaverat inhumana illa maria plerumque a Sperma ceti piscatoribus frequentata. Sed non omnes sciverunt esse; pauci ex iis compara- tione viderant; et parvus quidem numerus, qui nondum etiam et scienter proelium composuerat. Nam propter multitudinem lemborum; inordinate sparsi per totam aquosam circumferentiam, multi per solitudines latitudinum quaerentes audacter, raro vel numquam toto duodecimo vel amplius tractu, ut uno nuntio cuiuslibet veli occurrerent; longitudo cuiusque navigationis inordinata; irr tempora navigandi; Haec omnia, cum aliis adiunctis, directis et indirectis, diu diffusa per totum orbem balaenarum classem impediebant peculiaris nuntii singularis de Moby Dick. Vix dubitandum erat, vasa plura in tali vel tali tempore vel tali vel meridiano incidisse, sperma ceti singularis magnitudinis et malignitatis, quae balaena, cum invadunt magna pernicie; eos omnino effugerant; quibusdam mentibus non fuit iniqua praesumptio, inquam, balaenam in quaestionem non aliam esse quam Moby Dick necesse est. Nuper tamen sperma ceti piscationis variis et non infrequentibus instantiis notata erat immanis feritatis, astutiae, et malitiae in monstro aggressi; propterea factum est, ut qui imprudenter Moby Dick pugnarunt; venatores forte tales venatores plerumque contenti erant peculiarem terrorem, quam ad singularem causam piscationis sperma ceti magis quasi ad pericula tribuere. Sic fere inter Achab et balaenam perniciosos congressus hactenus in vulgus spectatus est.
    </p>
    <p>
       Illos autem, qui prius Albo Cete, forte eum conspexit; Initio rei se quisque eorum paene tam audacter ac sine metu deposuit quam ceterae eius generis cetus. Sed tandem in his incursibus tantae calamitates, non intortis manibus ac plantis, fractis membris, aut abscissionibus devorandis, sed fatalis ad ultimum fatale gradum. repetitae clades repulsas, terrores in Moby Dick cumulantes ac cumulantes; ea res longe processerat ut multorum venatorum fortium fortitudinem concuteret, ad quos tandem pervenit fabula balaenarum.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nec ulli liaec rumores exaggerabant, eoque magis exhorrebant veras historias funestorum certaminum. Non enim solum fabulosi rumores nascuntur ex ipso corpore omnium mirabilium eventuum mirabilium, percussa arbore fetus suos; sed in maritimis vita, longe plus quam in terra firma, ferae rumores abundant, ubi res ulla satis firma est. Et ut mare hac in re terram superat, sic cetus piscaria omnem aliam vitam maritimam, in admiratione et terrore rumorum, qui ibi interdum versantur, superat. Non enim solum balaenae corpus ab illa ignorantia et superstitiosa omnibus nautis haereditarium immunis sunt; sed inter omnes nautas, quidquid in mari admirabile est, ab omnibus dissident; concurrunt non modo maxima eius miracula, sed manus maxillae proelium committunt. Solus in tot ultimis aquis, ut mille passuum cum mille passis litoribus mille facias, non ad focum ullum adire vel hospitale sub ea parte solis; in his latitudinibus ac longi- tudinibus, nimis talem vocationem persequens, balaena involvitur influentiis omnibus, quae gravidam multiformem partum fingunt.
    </p>
    <p>
       Merito igitur semper volumen colligens ex solo transitu per latissima aquea spatia, effusos rumores de Albio balena in fine incorporavit sibi omne genus morbidorum suggestionum, ac semiformata foetalium suggestionum supernaturalium institutionum, quae tandem Moby Dick novis terroribus incommodatus ab omni quod visibiliter apparet investivit. Ita ut in multis tandem terrorem incuteret, ut pauci, qui ab iis saltem rumoribus de Albo ceto audierant, pauci venatores maxillæ pericula subire vellent.
    </p>
    <p>
       Erant autem adhuc aliae influentiae practicae et magis vitales ad opus faciendum. Ne hodie quidem sperma ceti pristinam dignitatem habet, quod ab omnibus aliis leviathan speciebus formidabiliter distinguitur, e mentibus balaenarum ut corpus exstinguitur. Sunt qui hodie inter eos sint, qui, licet ingeniosi ac fortiter pugnando ad Groenlandiam seu Cete, forte vel ab imperitia, vel imperitia, vel timiditate, certamen cum Sperma ceti detrectant; certe balaenae plurimae sunt, praesertim inter illas gentes balaenarum sub vexillo Americano non navigantes, qui numquam sperma ceti hostiliter congressi sunt, sed quorum sola leviathan cognitio ad ignobilem monstrum primum in septentrione persecutus restringitur; sedet in fossuris suis, Audient isti puerili foco et metu, feris et novis Australibus thalamis. Neque praecellens formidolosa sperma ceti magnius usquam comprehensa est, quam in iis proris quae eum obducunt.
    </p>
    <p>
       Et quasi nunc probata potentiae suae veritas, ante eam obumbravit prioribus fabulosis; Invenimus librum aliquem physici, Olassen et Povelson, qui sperma ceti non modo omni creaturae in mari consternatus esse, sed etiam tam incredibiliter feroces esse ut humano sanguine semper sitim esse. Neque etiam usque ad tantum tempus, ut Cuvier, hae vel fere similes impressiones abolentur. Nam in Naturali sua historia ipse baro affirmat omnes pisces (squales inclusos) vivacissimis terroribus perculsos esse adspectu Spermae, et saepe in praecipiti fugae se scopulos ita impingunt. violentiam ad causam instantaneae mortis. &quot; Et utcunque experientiae communes in piscaria emendant tales auditiones; tamen in plena horrore usque ad sanguinariam item de Povelson, superstitiosa fides in eis est, vocationis suae vicissitudine, in venatorum mentibus recreata.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ita ut rumoribus et prodigiis de eo exagitatus, piscatorum non pauci, in Moby Dick memorati, superioribus diebus Piscariam Sperma ceti, cum saepe difficile esset, longos balaenarum consuetudines ad pericula conscendenda, revocarunt. novae atque audaciae bellicae; tales protestantes, quamvis alii leviathani in spe persequeretur, tamen insequi et lanceam cusperunt, qualis sperma ceti mortalis non esset. Quod attentare possit, inevitabiliter divelli in celeri aeternitate. In hoc capite nonnulla sunt praeclara documenta quae consuli possunt.
    </p>
    <p>
       Fuerunt tamen nonnulli, qui etiam contra haec parati erant ad Moby Dick persequendum; pluresque, qui longius et vage, sine singulari aliqua calamitate, sine superstitiosis comitibus ad audiendum eum, satis difficilem pugnae oblatum non fugiunt.
    </p>
    <p>
       Una ex silvestribus suggestionibus commemorata, ut tandem ad coniunctionem cum Candida balena in animos superstitiosius inclinaret, moby Dick ubiquitous fuit, effusus fastus fuit; uno eodemque momento temporis in diversis latitudinibus se congressum fuisse.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nec credulus talis animi fuisse, sine aliqua superstitiosi probabilitatis specie prorsus haec opinio fuit. Nam ut cursus marium secreta usque ad eruditissimam inquisitionem nondum sunt divulgata; ita abditae viae Sperma ceti, cum sub aequore manent, magna ex parte inexplicabiles suis persequentibus; ac subinde speculationes illas curiosissimas et contradictorias, maxime de modis mysticis exortas, quibus se in profundissimam sonans tanta celeritate ad extrema quaeque transvexit.
    </p>
    <p>
       Res notissima est tam Americanis quam Anglicis navibus balaenarum, et res in auctoritate ante annos a Scoresby positas, quosdam balaenas longe septentrionales in Pacifico captas esse, in quorum corpora spicula inventa sunt. harpagones in Groenlandiae maria iaculantes. Neque dubitandum est, quin in quibusdam exemplis declaratum sit intervallum temporis inter utrumque oppugnationem complures dies excedere non posse. Unde per consequentiam creditum est a nonnullis balaenis, quod Transitus Nor&#39; Occidentalis, tamdiu homini problema, numquam balaeno problema est. Ut hic, in vera viva experientia hominum viventium, prodigia olim in Lusitania mediterranea Strello montis narrantur (prope cuius cacumen lacus esse dicebatur in quo naufragia navium usque ad superficiem natabant); et adhuc mirabiliorem fabulam de Arethusa fonte prope Syracusas, cuius aquae e terra sancta sub terra venisse creduntur; Narrationes istae fabulosae paene res cetorum adaequatae sunt.
    </p>
    <p>
       Coactus igitur adsuefactus his prodigiis ; ignarusque post crebras impetus intrepidas, balena alba vivus evaserat; quod mirum non est, quosdam balaenos in superstitionibus suis ulterius progredi; adnuntians Moby Dick non solum ubiquitous sed immortalis (nam immortalitas est sed ubiquitas in tempore); cum nemora hastarum in latera transmitterent, incolumes tamen adnataret; aut si semper effusus est sanguis, talis visio non nisi luridae erroris est; nam rursus insanguis undarum centenos leucas, intemerata iterum visura gagates.
    </p>
    <p>
       Sed etiam his supernaturalibus suspicionibus exutus, satis erat in terrenis monstri faciendis et inconsuebilibus ingenii vi imaginationem ferire insolita. Erat enim non tam inusitatae molis, ut tantum ab aliis belluarum sperma discerneret, sed, ut alibi eiecta erat, peculiare nivis rugosa frons, alta pyramidica gibbo. Haec erant eminentia; quibus signis, etiam in inmenso et ignoto mari, identitatem suam a longe cognoscentibus se patefecit.
    </p>
    <p>
       Corpus reliquum ita maculosum, maculosum, marmoratum eodem colore obliquatum, ut ad extremum candoris balaenam appellationem adeptus sit. Nomen quidem proprium vivida specie, quum medium cernitur elapsus ad meridiem, per opaca caerulea maris, lactea evigilans spumae lactea, omnia fulgentibus aureis sparsa.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nec insueta eius magnitudo, nec praeclari coloris, nec deforme maxillae inferioris, quod tantum cetum naturali terrore circumdedit, quanta illa singularis et intellegens malignitas, quam ex certa ratione etiam atque etiam evincit. eius insultus. Prae omnibus insidiosa fuga plus pavoris quam forte alia res perculit. Nam cum ante exsultantem omni terrore omni apparens signum terroris innuisset, aliquoties circumire repente notum est, ac deprimere, aut assulis substernere aut perterritos navem agere in navem. .
    </p>
    <p>
       Plures iam caedes eius insequutus est. Sed quamquam similia clades, quamvis parum eiectae, in piscando minime inusitatae fuerunt; plerunque tamen tale visum est ceti infernalis praemeditatione feritatis, ut omnis laceratio, aut mors, quam faciebat, ab imprudenti agente non omnino inflicta reputaretur.
    </p>
    <p>
       Judica igitur, quibus incensa fremant mentes furiosorum venatorum inpulsos, cum per ramenta navigia mandantur, et lacerae comitum demersae membra natant albis irae vittis ceti diram. in sereno exacerbato lumine, quod arridebat, tanquam nascenti aut sponsali.

       Tres circum se clypeus navigia, remis Viribusque gyro volvitur ; dux unus, arrepto e prora recta cultro, ad arkansas duellis in hostem balaena pessumdatus, sex unciarum mucrone temere quaerens, ad balaenam vitam perveniat. Fuit dux ille Achab. Ac deinde, ut subito falcem suam sub se maxillam volvens, Moby Dick Achab crus velut herbam in agro metit. Nullus turbatus Turcus, nullus Venetus vel Malaius conductus, maiore malitia eum ferire potuit. Minima igitur causa fuit dubitandi, quod Achab ex illo prope fatale congressu indomitum adversus balanam vindictam fovisset, eo magis cecidisset, quod in rabiem suam tandem cum eo, non modo omnis, concidisset. corporales aerumnas, sed omnes ejus intellectuales et spirituales iras. Balena alba ante eum natavit monomaniacam incarnationem omnium malignarum institutionum quas quidam profundi homines in eis comedere sentiunt, donec cum dimidio corde et dimidio pulmone viventes relinquantur. Immaculata illa malignitas, quae ab initio fuit; cuius dominio etiam moderni Christiani medietatem mundorum adscribunt; quam coluerunt orientales Ophitae antiqui in statua sua diabolum. sed in execrabilem balaenam suam ideam delirante transferens, se totum mutilum contra ipsum comparet. Omnia furiosissima atque tormenta; omnia turbat rerum; omne verum cum malitia; quidquid nervos ac liba cerebro findit; omnes subtiles daemones vitae et cogitationis; omne malum, insanus Achab, visibiliter personificatae sunt, et in Moby Dick paene impugnatae sunt. Congessit in ceti album gibbum summam omnium generalium furorem, et odium sensit ab Adamo per omne genus suum descensum; deinde, quasi pilae praecordius fuisset, calidam cordis testam in eo prorumperet.
    </p>
    <p>
       Non est verisimile quod haec monomania in ipso instanti tempore sui corporis discerptionis suae instanti ortum sumpserunt. Tum monstrum vibrans, gladium in manu habebat, sed immissam subito iracundos et iras; et cum accepisset ictum, quod scidit, verisimile est, sed atrocem corporis lacerationem sensit, sed nihil amplius. Cum tamen hoc collisione ad domum reverti cogeretur, et per longos dies et hebdomades menses, Achab et angores jacebant in uno hamo, media hyeme volvens triste patagonium promunturium ululans; tunc laceratum corpus et animam in se fudit; eoque interjecto insanire fecit. Tum demum in insciente navigatione, post congressum quod ultima monomania eum comprehenderit, propemodum certum videtur ex eo, quod per intervalla in transitu furiosus fuit; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun&#39;sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man&#39;s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab&#39;s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab&#39;s broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.
    </p>
    <p>
       This is much; yet Ahab&#39;s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man&#39;s upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him.
    </p>
    <p>
       The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
       Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a Job&#39;s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man&#39;s ire—by what evil magic their souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.

       CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.
    </h2>
    <p>
       What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.
    </p>
    <p>
       Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any man&#39;s soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.
    </p>
    <p>
       Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants” above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble things—the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.
    </p>
    <p>
       This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*
    </p>
    <p>
       *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified terror.
    </p>
    <p>
       As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence 
      <i>
        Requiem
      </i>
       denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him 
      <i>
        Requin
      </i>
       .
    </p>
    <p>
       Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God&#39;s great, unflattering laureate, Nature.*
    </p>
    <p>
       *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king&#39;s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman&#39;s name for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge&#39;s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
       I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round its neck, with the ship&#39;s time and place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!
    </p>
    <p>
       Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.
    </p>
    <p>
       But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross.
    </p>
    <p>
       What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears. The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive deformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place!
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.
    </p>
    <p>
       Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
       But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness—though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?
    </p>
    <p>
       Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to recall them now.
    </p>
    <p>
       Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
    </p>
    <p>
       Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its neighbors—the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia&#39;s Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “the tall pale man” of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can&#39;st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.
    </p>
    <p>
       I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples.
    </p>
    <p>
       First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.
    </p>
    <p>
       But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?
    </p>
    <p>
       No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.
    </p>
    <p>
       Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
    </p>
    <p>
       Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
    </p>
    <p>
       But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian&#39;s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
       Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?
