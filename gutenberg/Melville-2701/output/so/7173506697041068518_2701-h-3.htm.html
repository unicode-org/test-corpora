       CUTUBKA 10aad. Saaxiib laabta ah.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Ku soo noqoshada Spouter-Inn ee Chapel, waxaan ka helay Queequeg halkaas kaligeed; Waxa uu ka tagay Chapel ka hor ducadii in muddo ah. Wuxuu ku fadhiistay kursi dabka hortiisa yaal, cagihiisana waxay saaran yihiin foornada dabka lagu shido, gacantana wuxuu ku hayaa wejigaas sanamkii negro ee yaraa; isagoo si adag u eegaya wejigiisa, oo mindi dawac ah si tartiib ah sanka uga fayday, isla markaana uu isula muquuninayo dariiqii gaalnimadiisa.
    </p>
    <p>
       Laakiin hadda waa laga gooyay, oo wuxuu taagay masawir; oo aad u dhaqso badan, oo miiskii aaday, ayaa halkaas ku soo qaatay buug weyn, oo inta uu dhabta saaray waxa uu bilaabay tirinta boggaga si ula kac ah; bog kasta oo kontonaad ah—sida aan u hanqal taagayo—in aan cabbaar joogsado, oo aan hareerihiisa ka eego meel bannaan, oo aan odhaah dheer ka bixinayo foori fajac ah oo yaab leh. Waxa uu mar kale bilaabi lahaa kontanka soo socda; oo aad mooddo inuu marba lambar kow ka bilaabayo, sidii isagoon tirin karin wax ka badan konton, oo waxaa la wada helay tiro intaa le&#39;eg oo kontonaad ah, in uu yaabban bogag badan.
    </p>
    <p>
       Anigoo xiise badan ayaan iska fadhiistay daawashada isaga. Inkastuu ahaa bahalnimo, oo si qarsoon wejiga uga xumaaday — ugu yaraan dhadhankayga — wejigiisa ayaa haddana wax ku dhex lahaa oo aan sinaba la isku raacsanayn. Nafta ma qarin kartid. Iyada oo dhammaan tattooing-kiisa aan qarsooneyn, waxaan u maleeyay inaan arkay raadadka qalbi daacad ah oo fudud; Indhihiisa waaweyn ee moolka dheer, madowga ololaya iyo geesinimada, waxaa ka muuqday calaamo ruux oo ku dhiiran kara kun shaydaan. Waxyaalahan oo dhan mooyaane, waxaa jiray dareen weyn oo ku saabsan jaahilka, kaas oo xataa caqli-la&#39;aantiisu aanay gebi ahaanba naafoobi karin. Waxa uu u ekaa nin aan waligii nixin oo aan lahayn cid dayn ku leh. Hadday ahaan lahayd, in madaxa la xiiro, oo foolkiisa uu ka soo baxay si xor ah oo nasasho leh, oo uu u ekaaday ka sii ballaadhsanaantiisa haddii kale, tani ma go&#39;aansan doono; laakiin waxaa hubaal ah in madaxiisu uu ahaa phrenologically mid aad u wanaagsan. Waxay u ekaan kartaa wax lagu qoslo, laakiin waxay i xasuusisay madaxa General Washington, sida lagu arkay basaska caanka ah ee isaga. Waxay lahayd isla dheer oo si joogto ah loo darajeeyey jiidhida dib-u-gurashada ee ka korreeya cidhifyada, kuwaas oo sidoo kale aad u saadaalinaya, sida laba dhismo oo dhaadheer oo qoryo leh oo korka ka ah. Queequeg wuxuu ahaa George Washington si dad-cuni ah u horumaray.
    </p>
    <p>
       In kasta oo aan si dhow u sawiranayay, oo badh iska dhigaya in aan eegayo duufaanka ka imanaya galka, waligiis dheg jalaq uma siin joogitaankayga, waligiis iskuma dhibin ilaa hal jaleeco; laakiin waxay u muuqdeen kuwo ku mashquulsan tirinta boggaga buugga yaabka leh. Anigoo tixgalinaya sida bulsho ahaan aan u wada seexan jirnay habeen hore, gaar ahaanna tixgalinaya cududdii kalgacalka lahayd ee aan helay oo la igu soo tuuray markii aan subixii soo toosay, waxa aan u malaynayay in aan dan ka lahayn isaga oo aad yaab leh. Laakiin dugaaggu waa noole yaab leh; mararka qaarkood ma garanaysid sida saxda ah ee loo qaado. Marka hore waxay si xad dhaaf ah u korayaan; is-ururintooda deggan ee fududaynta waxay u muuqataa xigmad Socratic ah. Waxaan sidoo kale ogaaday in Queequeg aanu waligiis wada shaqayn, ama aad u yar, iyada oo ay la socdaan badmareenada kale ee hudheelka. Wax horumar ah ma uu samaynin; wuxuu u muuqday mid aan lahayn rabitaan ah inuu ballaariyo goobada dadka uu yaqaan. Waxyaalahan oo dhammu waxay igu dhufteen sidii mid xoog badan; haddana, marka la eego fikradaha labaad, waxaa jiray wax ku dhow dhow. Halkan waxaa joogay nin gurigiisa u jira labaatan kun oo mayl, jidka Cape Horn, oo ah — taas oo ahayd dariiqa kaliya ee uu halkaas ku tagi karo — lagu dhex tuuray dad la yaab leh isaga oo aad mooddo inuu joogo meeraha Jupiter; haddana wuxuu u ekaa mid si fudud u deggan; ilaalinta xasiloonida ugu badan; ku qanacsan yahay wehelkiisa; had iyo jeer waa la siman yahay naftiisa. Hubaal tani waxay ahayd taabashada falsafada wanaagsan; inkasta oo aanu shaki ku jirin in aanu waligii maqlin waxaa jiray wax la mid ah. Laakiin, laga yaabee, si aan u noqonno faylasuufyo run ah, innagoo dhimanaya waa in aynaan ku baraarugsanayn in ay sidaas u noolaadaan ama u dadaalaan. Marka ugu dhakhsaha badan ee aan maqlo in nin noocaas ah ama sidaas oo kale ah uu naftiisa u dhiibo falsafada, waxaan ku soo gabagabeynayaa, sida haweeneydii hore ee dyspeptic, waa inuu &quot;jabiyey dheef-shiid kiimikaad.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Sidaan meeshaas u fadhiistay qolkaas cidlada ah hadda; Dabka oo si hoose u gubanaya, marxaladdaas qafiifka ah marka, ka dib markii uu xooggiisa ugu horreeya hawada kululeeyo, ka dibna kaliya ayaa dhalaalaya in la eego; hadhkii fiidnimada iyo muuqalada ayaa ku soo ururay daasadaha, oo innagu soo dhex eegayay aamusnaan, laba keliyi; Duufaanta kor u kacda iyada oo aan lahayn barar adag; Waxaan bilaabay in aan dareemo dareen yaab leh. Waxaan dareemay dhalaal igu jira. Mar dambe qalbigeyga ka go&#39;ay iyo gacanta aan xanaaqsanahay uma soo jeedin dunidii yeyda. Duurjoogtan nasteexo ayaa soo furtay. Halkaas ayuu fadhiistay, isagoo aad u danaysan oo ka hadlaya dabeecad aan ku gabbanayn munaafaqnimo ilbaxnimo iyo khiyaano qaawan. Wild wuxuu ahaa; muuqaal aad u badan oo la arko; haddana waxaan bilaabay inaan dareemo naftayda si qarsoodi ah oo xaggiisa loo soo jiitay. Iyo waxyaalahaas isku midka ah ee ka celin lahaa inta badan kuwa kale, waxay ahaayeen magnets-ka sidaas igu soo jiiday. Waxaan isku dayi doonaa saaxiib jaahilka ah, waxay ila tahay, mar haddii naxariista Masiixiyiinta la caddeeyey laakiin ixtiraam bannaan. Kursigayga ayaan agtiisa soo dhigay, waxaanan sameeyay calaamado saaxiibtinimo iyo tilmaamo, anigoo ku dadaalaya inaan la hadlo isaga. Markii hore waxa uu yara dareemay horumarkan; laakiin hadda, markii aan tixraacay martigelintiisii ​​habeen hore, wuxuu iga codsaday inuu i weydiiyo inaan mar kale noqon doonno saaxiibo. Waxaan ku idhi haa; Halka aan u maleeyay inuu ku faraxsan yahay, laga yaabee in yar oo la ammaanay.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dabadeed buuggii ayaannu isla-rognay, waxaanan ku dadaalay inaan u sharraxo ujeeddada daabacaada iyo macnaha dhowrka sawir ee ku jira. Sidaas ayaan isla markiiba ku mashquulay dantiisa; Intaa ka dib waxa aanu u tagnay in aanu jabbeerno sida ugu wanaagsan ee aanu ka heli karnay muuqaalada kala duwan ee dibadda ee lagu arko magaaladan caanka ah. Wax yar ka dib waxaan soo jeediyay qiiq bulsho; iyo, isagoo soo saaray shandadkiisii ​​iyo tomahawk, ayuu si aamusnaan ah ii soo bandhigay puff. Dabadeedna waannu fadhiisannay, annaga oo tubooyinkaas duurjoogta ah ku beddelanayna, oo si joogto ah u ilaalinaynay na dhexdayada.
    </p>
    <p>
       Haddii uu weli baraf danayn la&#39;aan ah igu soo dhex qariyay naaska Jaahiliga, qiiqan macaan ee aan haysannay, isla markiiba wuu dhalaalay, oo naga tagay saaxiibo. Waxa uu u ekaa in uu ii qaadanayo si dabiici ah oo aan qarsoodi ahayn sida aniga oo kale; oo markii uu qiiqayadii dhammaatay ayuu foodda iga saaray, oo uu dhexda igu xidhay, oo uu yidhi hadda ka dib ayaannu is guursannay; Macnaha, odhaahda waddankiisa, waxaanu ahayn saaxiibbo laabta ah; isagoo faraxsan ayuu ii dhiman lahaa, haddii loo baahdo. Wadankii, ololka saaxiibtinimada degdega ah wuxuu u ekaan lahaa mid aad u degdeg badan, wax badan oo la aamini karo; laakiin arxan-darradan fudud xeerarkaas hore ma khuseeyaan.
    </p>
    <p>
       Casho ka dib, iyo sheeko bulsheed iyo qiiq kale, waxaan wada galnay qolkeena. Madaxiisii ​​oo la mariyey ayuu hadiyad iga dhigay; Wuxuu soo baxay boorsada tubaakada oo aad u weyn, oo intuu tubaakada hoostiisa ku taabtay, wuxuu soo bixiyey soddon dollar oo lacag ah; dabadeed inta miiska ku kala fidisay, oo si farsamaysan u kala qaybiyay laba qaybood oo isle&#39;eg, ayaa mid ka mid ah ii soo riixay, oo uu yidhi waa kaygii. Waxaan u socday inaan dib u eegno; laakiin wuu iga aamusay isagoo ku shubay jeebabka surwaaladayda. Waan u ogolaaday inay joogaan. Dabadeed salaaddii maqrib buu soo aaday, sanamkiisii ​​ayuu la soo baxay, sabuuraddiina warqaddii buu ka saaray. Calaamado iyo astaamo gaar ah, waxaan u maleeyay inuu u muuqday mid iga welwelsan inaan ku biiro isaga; laakiin aniga oo si fiican u garanayay waxa raacaya, ayaan cabbaar ka tashaday in, haddii uu i casuumo, aan fulin doono iyo haddii kale.
    </p>
    <p>
       Waxaan ahaa Christian wanaagsan; ku dhashay kuna dhashay laabta Kaniisadda Presbyterian ee aan la khaldin. Haddaba sidee baan ula midoobi karaa sanamkan duurjoogta ah oo aan u caabudayo qorigiisa? Laakiin waa maxay cibaadadu? Ma waxaad u malaynaysaa, Ismaaciilow, in Ilaaha weyn ee samada iyo dhulka - jaahilka iyo dhammaanba - uu ka masayri karo qoryo madow oo aan macno lahayn? Macquul maaha! Laakiin waa maxay cibaadadu?-in la sameeyo doonista Ilaah - 
      <i>
        taasi
      </i>
       waa cibaadada. Oo waa maxay doonista Ilaah?- in uu ninkayga ku sameeyo wixii aan doonayo in ninkayga uu igu sameeyo - 
      <i>
        taasu
      </i>
       waa doonista Ilaah. Hadda, Queequeg waa nin ila wadaaga. Oo maxaan jeclaan lahaa in Queequeg-kani igu sameeyo? Waayo, igula midow cibaadadayda gaarka ah ee Presbyterian. Sidaa darteed, waa inaan markaas isaga ula midooba tiisa; ergo, waa inaan noqdaa sanam. Markaasaan xiiradihii shiday; waxay gacan ka gaysatay kor u qaadida sanamkii yaraa ee aan waxba galabsan; wuxuu u soo bandhigay buskud guban oo uu la socdo Queequeg; salaam ka hor laba jeer ama saddex jeer; dhunkaday sankiisa; Oo taas yeelnay, waannu iska qaawinnay oo seexannay annagoo nabdoon niyadayada iyo dunida oo dhan la nool. Laakiin ma aannu seexan in yar oo sheeko yar la&#39;aanteed.
    </p>
    <p>
       Siday tahay anigu garan maayo; laakiin ma jirto meel sariir la mid ah oo sirta sirta ah looga sheego saaxiibada dhexdooda. Nin iyo naag, waxay yiraahdeen, halkaas ayaa gunta hoose ee naftoodu isu furaan; iyo qaar ka mid ah lamaanayaasha hore waxay inta badan been sheegaan oo ku sheekeystaan ​​waqtiyo hore ilaa subaxda ku dhow. Haddaba, markaa, qalbiyadeenna &#39;moon moon&#39;, waxaan jiifsaday aniga iyo Queequeg - lamaane jacayl leh oo raaxo leh.

       CUTUBKA 11. Dharka habeenkii.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Sidaas ayaanu sariirta u jiifnay, innagoo sheekaysanayna oo seexanaynay wakhtiyo gaaban, Queequeg hadda iyo ka dib waxa aanu si kalgacal leh lugihiisa ii sawiran u soo tuuray, ka dibna dib u soo jiiday; si gebi ahaanba bulsho iyo xor iyo fudayd ayaanu ahayn; Markii, ugu dambeyntii, jaahwareerkayada awgiis, wixii yaraa ee xafisadii yaraa ee nagu hadhay ay wada tageen, oo aanu dareennay inaan mar kale kacno, in kasta oo nasasho maalmeedku uu weli hoos u sii dhacayo mustaqbalka.
    </p>
    <p>
       Haa, aad baannu u soo jeednay; sidaa awgeed mawqifkayadii aan is-daba joognay waxa uu bilaabay in aanu daalno, in yar iyo in yarba waxa aanu is aragnay in aanu fadhino; Dharka ayaa si fiican noogu xidhnaa, annagoo ku tiirsan sabuuradda madaxa iyadoo afartayada jilib isku soo wada jeedaan, labadayada sanna ay korkooda ku foorarsanayaan, sidii jilbahayagii oo diirran. Waxaan dareennay mid aad u fiican oo dhuuban, si ka sii badan maadaama ay aad u qabow ahayd albaabbada; Weliba dharkii sariirta waa laga soo baxay, anigoo arkaya inaan dab ka jirin qolka. Si kastaba ha ahaatee, waxaan leeyahay, maxaa yeelay, si aad ugu raaxaysataan diirimaadka jidhka, qayb yar oo idinka mid ah waa inay qabowdaan, waayo, dunidan wax tayo ah oo aan ka duwanayn ma jiraan. Waxba iskama jiraan. Haddii aad naftaada u sheegto in aad dhammaantiis ku raaxaysatay, oo aad muddo dheer jirtay, markaa laguma odhan karo raaxo dambe. Laakiin haddii, sida Queequeg iyo aniga oo sariirta ku jira, cidhifka sankaaga ama taajka madaxaagu wax yar ayuu qaboojin doonaa, sababta markaa, runtii, miyir-qabka guud waxaad dareemaysaa diirimaad aad u faraxsan oo aan qarsoodi ahayn. Sababtaas awgeed guriga hurdada waa in aan waligiis lagu dhejin dab, taas oo ah mid ka mid ah raaxo-darrada raaxada leh ee taajiriinta. Waayo, dhererka noocan oo kale ah ee dhadhanka waa inaadan haysan wax aan ahayn buste u dhexeeya adiga iyo jilicsanaantaada iyo qabowga hawada sare. Markaa halkaas waxaad jiiftaa sida dhimbiil diirran oo ku dhex yaal wadnaha crystal arctic.
    </p>
    <p>
       In muddo ah ayaanu sidan u fadhinay, markii aan is idhi indhahayga kala qaadi; Waayo, markaan go&#39;yaal u dhexeeyo, hadday tahay maalin iyo hadday tahay habeennimo, iyo hadday seexato iyo hadday soo jeedoba, waxaan haystaa hab aan mar walba indhahayga ku dhawro, si aan u yeesho dareen aan sariirta seexdo. Sababtoo ah ma jiro nin waligiis si sax ah u dareemi karo aqoonsigiisa marka laga reebo indhihiisa oo xiran; sida haddii gudcurku runtii ahaa qaybta saxda ah ee nuxurkayaga, in kastoo iftiinku uu aad ugu habboon yahay qaybtayada dhoobada ah. Markaan indhahayga furay, oo aan ka soo baxay gudcurkaygii quruxda badnaa ee is-abuuray oo galay gudcurka bannaan ee mugdiga ah ee laba-iyo-toban-saacnimo-habeennimo, waxaan la kulmay nacayb aan la aqbali karin. Sinaba kama aan diidin tilmaanta Queequeg ee ahayd in laga yaabo inay ugu wacnayd in la garaaco iftiinka, anagoo arkaynay inaan aad u soo jeednay; oo ka sokow wuxuu dareemay rabitaan xoog leh si uu u helo dhawr xabbo oo aamusan oo ka soo baxa Tomahawk. Ha ahaado, in kastoo aan dareemay nacayb xoog leh oo ku saabsan sigaarkiisa sariirta habeenkii ka hor, haddana bal eeg sida ay cuqdadyada adagi u koraan marka jacaylku mar u yimaado inuu soo laabo. Hadda maan jeclayn wax ka wanaagsan in aan sigaar cabbo Queequeg aniga, xitaa sariirta, sababtoo ah wuxuu u muuqday mid ay ka buuxdo farxad guri oo deggan. Mar dambe ma dareemin walaac aan fiicneyn oo ku saabsan siyaasadda caymiska mulkiilaha. Waxa aan noolahay oo kaliya raaxada qarsoodiga ah ee la wadaaga tuubo iyo buste saaxiib dhab ah. Iyada oo jaakadayada xiiqsan ee garbaha lagu sawiray, ayaannu hadda Tomahawk ka gudubnay midba midka kale, ilaa aayar aayar korkayada waxaa ka soo baxay tijaabiye buluug ah oo qiiq ah, oo uu iftiimiyay ololka laambada cusub.
    </p>
    <p>
       In ay ahayd in tijaabiyahan aan daah-furnayn uu duurjoogta u rogay muuqaallo fog, ma garanayo, laakiin hadda waxa uu ka hadlay jasiiradda uu u dhashay; aniga oo aad u xiiseeya in aan taariikhdiisa maqlo ayaan ka baryay in uu sii wado oo uu sheego. Isaga oo faraxsan ayuu u hoggaansamay. In kasta oo aan wakhtigaas aan yara fahmin ereyadiisa, haddana daah-furka xigay, markii aan aad u bartay weedh-sheeggiisa jaban, haddana ii suurto geliya in aan soo bandhigo sheekada oo dhan sida ay ku caddayn karto qalfoofka aan bixiyo.

       CUTUBKA 12. Taariikh nololeedka.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Queequeg wuxuu u dhashay Rokovoko, jasiirad aad uga fog Galbeedka iyo Koonfurta. Ma aha hoos in khariidad kasta; meelaha runta ah weligood maaha.
    </p>
    <p>
       Marka uu bahal cusub oo bahalnimo ah ku ordayo dhirtii uu u dhashay ee caws-cawska ah, oo ay orgiga koolkoolinta ka daba-socdo, sidii uu geed-cagaaran yahay; xataa markaas, Queequeg nafteeda hamiga leh, waxay ku gabbanaysay rabitaan xoog leh oo ah inay aragto wax ka badan Masiixiyadda marka loo eego muunad whaler ama laba. Aabihiis wuxuu ahaa Chief Chief, Boqor; adeerkiis wadaad sare; dhanka hooyadana wuxuu ku faani jiray habaryar oo ahaa xaasaska halgamayaasha aan la guulaysan. Dhiig aad u wanaagsan baa xididkiisa ku jiray - walxihii boqornimada; In kasta oo uu murugaysan yahay, haddana, waxa aan ka baqayaa, cunista cunnada ee uu ku nafaqeeyay dhallinyarnimadiisii.
    </p>
    <p>
       Markab Sag Harbor ah ayaa booqday gacanka aabbihii, Queequeg-na waxa uu raadiyay marin uu u maro dhulalka Masiixiyiinta. Laakiin doonnidii oo haysata nimankii nimankii badmaaxiinta ahaa, ayaa dharkiisii ​​ka jeestay; Boqorka aabbihiis saamayntiisa oo dhanna ma guulaysan. Laakiin Queequeg ayaa nidar galay. Isaga oo keligiis saaran doonnida, waxa uu ku koolkooliyey meel fog, taas oo uu ogaa in markabku ay qasab tahay in uu soo maro marka ay jasiiradda ka baxdo. Dhinacna waxaa ku yiil geed shacaab ah; dhanka kale carrab hoose oo dhul ah, oo ay ka buuxaan kayn geedo geedo ah oo ka soo baxay biyaha. Intuu doonnidiisii ​​qariyey, oo weli sabbaynaysay, oo jiqyadaas dhexdooda, oo biqilkeedii baddu u sii jeedday, ayuu fadhiistay xaggii dambe ee dambe, isagoo gacanta ku koolkoolinaya; markuu doonnidii simbiriirixayay ayuu sidii biqil u soo baxay; helay dhinaceeda; isagoo hal daboc oo cagtiisa ah gadoontay oo quustay doonnidii; kor u fuulay silsiladaha; oo intuu dhererka isku tuuray ayuu sagxaddii dul saaray, oo intuu giraantii ku dhegay, wuxuu ku dhaartay inaanu sii dayn, in kastoo la jabsaday.
    </p>
    <p>
       Wax aan waxba tarayn ayaa naakhuudihii ugu hanjabay inuu badda ku tuuri doono; laalaad ka saaray cududihiisa qaawan; Queequeg wuxuu ahaa wiil uu dhalay Boqor, Queequegna ma kicin. Waxaa ku dhacay niyad-xumadiisa quusta ah, iyo rabitaankiisa duurjoogta ah ee uu ku doonayo inuu ku booqdo Kirishtaanka, naakhuudihii ayaa ugu dambayntii ka soo noqday, oo u sheegay inuu iska dhigi karo guriga. Laakin da&#39;yarkan quruxda badan - baddan Amiirka Wales, waligiis ma arkin qolka Kabtanka. Markaasay dejiyeen naakhuudihii, oo waxay samaysteen nibiriyo. Laakiin sida Czar Peter oo kale oo ku qanacsan inuu ku shaqeeyo maraakiibta magaalooyinka shisheeye, Queequeg ma quudhsaneyn wax ceeb ah, haddii uu sidaas darteed si farxad leh u heli karo awoodda iftiiminta waddankiisa aan la baran. Waayo, xagga hoose -sidaa darteed wuxuu ii sheegay - waxaa ku kallifay rabitaan qotodheer oo ah inuu wax ka barto Masiixiyiinta dhexdooda, farshaxanka uu dadkiisa uga dhigo kuwo ka farxad badan sidii ay ahaan jireen; iyo in ka badan, weli way ka fiicnaayeen. Laakiin, hoogay! Dhaqamada nibiriga ayaa isla markiiba ku qanciyay in xitaa Masiixiyiintu ay noqon karaan kuwo xun iyo kuwa shar leh; Aad iyo aad buu uga sii badan yahay quruumaha aabbihiis oo dhan. Yimid ugu dambayntii hore ee Sag Harbor; oo markuu arkay wixii ay naakhuudihii halkaas ku sameeyeen; ka dibna u sii socday Nantucket, oo ay arkeen sida ay ugu kharash gareeyeen 
      <i>
        meeshaas
      </i>
       sidoo kale, Queequeg miskiin ah ayaa u dhiibay khasaare. Wuxuu u maleeyay, inay tahay duni shar leh dhammaan meerisyada; Waxaan dhiman doonaa jaahili.
    </p>
    <p>
       Oo sidaas daraaddeed sanam jir ah oo qalbiga ku jira, wuxuu weli ku dhex noolaa Masiixiyiintan, oo dharkooda xidhay, oo isku dayay inuu ku hadlo gibberishkooda. Sidaa darteed siyaabaha qallafsan ee isaga ku saabsan, in kasta oo hadda wakhti laga joogo guriga.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tibaaxo, waxaan ku waydiiyay in uusan soo jeedin in dib loo noqdo, iyo in la sameeyo carshiga; waayo, wuxuu u malaynayay inuu aabbihiis dhintay oo uu baxay, isagoo aad u da&#39; weyn, oo ugu dambaysta. Wuxuu ugu jawaabay maya, weli; oo ku daray inuu ahaa Masiixi cabsi badan, ama halkii Masiixiyiin, ayaa isaga aan ku habboonayn inuu fuulo carshi daahir ah oo aan nijaas lahayn oo soddon Boqor oo jaahilka ah hortiisa. Laakiin mar iyo marba, ayuu yidhi, wuu soo noqon doonaa,- kolkuu dareemay inuu mar kale baabtiisay. Si kastaba ha ahaatee, si aan qarsoodi ahayn, si kastaba ha ahaatee, wuxuu soo jeediyay inuu ku dhoofo, oo uu ku beero miraha duurjoogta ah dhammaan afarta badood. Waxay u sameeyeen kataliye, oo birta birta ah waxay u ahayd ushii boqornimada hadda.
    </p>
    <p>
       Waxaan weydiiyay waxa laga yaabo inay tahay ujeedadiisa dhow, taabashada dhaqdhaqaaqiisa mustaqbalka. Wuxuu ugu jawaabay, inuu mar kale badda aado, isagoo ku jira xirfaddiisii ​​hore. Intaa ka dib, waxaan u sheegay in nibiriga uu yahay naqshad aniga ii gaar ah, waxaanan ku wargaliyay in aan doonayo in aan ka dhoofo Nantucket, maadaama ay tahay dekedda ugu rajo-gelinta badan ee nibiri-jileec ka soo degi karo. Isla markiiba waxa uu go’aan ku gaadhay in uu ii raaco jasiiradaas, markab isla markab wada fuulo, isla saacada, isla doontii, isku qas, gaabnina aan la wadaago hap kasta; Aniga oo labadayda gacmood ku haya, si geesinnimo leh u dhex gal Potluck ee labada adduun. Waxaas oo dhan waxaan si farxad leh ugu sheegay; Waayo, kalgacalka aan hadda u qabo Queequeg ka sokow, waxa uu ahaa harpooneer waayo-arag ah, sidaas oo kale, waxa aanu ku fashilmi karin in uu faa&#39;iido weyn u yeesho mid ka mid ah, kaas oo, aniga oo kale, aan si buuxda u aqoon siraha nibiriga, inkasta oo uu si fiican u yaqaan badda, sida ay u yaqaanaan baayacmushtarleyda.
    </p>
    <p>
       Sheekadiisii ​​oo ay ku dhammaatay buunbuuntiisii ​​u dambaysay ee bakhtiday, Queequeg ayaa igu laab-qabtay, oo foodda igaga soo riixday, oo iftiinkii damisay, waannu iska rogrogay, sidaas iyo sidaas, oo in yar ayaanu hurudnay.

       CUTUBKA 13. Garaash.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Subaxdii xigtay, Isniintii, ka dib, markii aan madaxii duugoobay u tuuray timo-jare, si loo xiro, waxaan xaliyay biil aniga iyo saaxiibkay; anigoo isticmaalaya, si kastaba ha ahaatee, lacagta saaxiibkay. Milkiilaha qoslaya, iyo sidoo kale dadkii guriga joogay, waxay u muuqdeen kuwo la yaab leh saaxiibtinimada lama filaanka ah ee ka dhex dhalatay aniga iyo Queequeg - gaar ahaan sida Peter Coffin coffin iyo sheekooyin dibi isaga ku saabsan ayaa markii hore aad uga naxay qofka aan hadda la shaqayn jiray. leh.
    </p>
    <p>
       Waxa aanu soo amaahannay gaadhi-gacmeed, oo aanu fuulnay alaabtayada, oo ay ku jiraan shandad roogaga liita, iyo jawaannada shiraac ee Queequeg, waxaanu u sii dhaadhacnay “Moss,” baakidhkii yaraa ee Nantucket schooner ayaa ku dul dhegay xeebta. Markii aannu sii soconnay ayaa dadkii ku dhaygagay; Ma ahan Queequeg aad u badan - waayo waxay u baran jireen inay jidadka ku arkaan dad cuna isaga oo kale ah - laakiin waxay arkeen aniga iyo isaga shuruudo sir ah. Laakiin dheg uma aannu yeelanin, annagoo barrow-ka-wareejin ku wadnay, oo Queequeg hadda iyo ka dib u istaagaya si uu u hagaajiyo galka kastuunada. Waxaan weyddiiyey sababta uu wax sidan oo kale ah ugu sido xeebta, iyo in dhammaan maraakiibta nibiriga aanay helin habab u gaar ah. Si tan, nuxur ahaan, wuxuu ku jawaabay, in kasta oo waxa aan tilmaamay ay run tahay, haddana wuxuu lahaa jacayl gaar ah oo u gaar ah, sababtoo ah waxay ahayd walxo la hubo, oo si fiican loo tijaabiyey dagaal badan oo dhimasho ah, oo si qoto dheer ula socda quluubta. ee nibiriga. Marka la soo koobo, sida qaar badan oo ka mid ah beeralayda gudaha iyo kuwa jeexa, kuwaas oo gala seeraha beeralayda oo ku hubeysan masax-in kasta oo aan sinaba waajib ugu ahayn in ay qalabeeyaan-xitaa sidaas oo kale, Queequeg, sababo gaar ah oo u gaar ah, ayaa doorbiday hadhuudhkiisa.
    </p>
    <p>
       Isaga oo baarka gacantayda ka beddelaya, waxa uu iiga sheekeeyay sheeko qosol badan oo ku saabsan gaadhi-gacmeedkii ugu horreeyay ee uu abid arko. Waxay ku taal Sag Harbor. Milkiilayaasha markabkiisa, waxay u egtahay inay amaahiyeen mid, kaas oo uu ku qaado laabtiisa culculus oo uu ku geeyo gurigii uu ku jiray. Inuusan u muuqan mid jaahil ah oo ku saabsan shayga-in kasta oo run ahaantii uu si buuxda u ahaa, oo ku saabsan habka saxda ah ee loo maareeyo barrow-Queequeg ayaa laabtiisa saaray; si degdeg ah u garaaca; ka dibna garbaha barrow oo kor u qaado qulqulka. &quot;Sabab,&quot; waxaan idhi, &quot;Queequeg, waxaa laga yaabaa inaad si ka sii fiican taas u garanaysay, mid ayaa u malayn lahaa. Dadku miyaanay qoslin?
    </p>
    <p>
       Intaa ka dib, wuxuu ii sheegay sheeko kale. Dadka ku nool jasiiradda Rokovoko, waxay u egtahay, xafladaha arooskooda inay muujinayaan biyaha udgoon ee qumbaha yar yar ee calabash weyn oo wasakhaysan sida feerka; iyo feeradani had iyo jeer waxay samaysaa qurxinta dhexe ee weyn ee sariirta tidcan ee lagu qabto diyaafadda. Hadda markab ganacsi oo weyn ayaa mar taabtay Rokovoko, iyo taliyihii - dhammaan xisaabaadka, nin aad u sharaf badan, ugu yaraan kabtanka badda - taliyahan ayaa lagu martiqaaday xafladda arooska ee walaashii Queequeg, gabadh yar oo qurux badan oo hadda soo jeestay. toban ka mid ah. Waa hagaag; Markii dhammaan martidii arooska la isugu yimi guriga bambooga ee aroosadda, Kabtankan ayaa soo galay, waxaana loo dhiibay jagada maamuuska, isaga oo is dul taagay ka soo horjeedka feerka, iyo inta u dhaxaysa wadaadka sare iyo haybaddiisa Boqorka, Queequeg aabbihiis. Nimco ayaa la yidhi, - dadkaas waxay leeyihiin nimco sidoo kale annaguna - in kasta oo Queequeg ay ii sheegtay in naga duwan, kuwaas oo waqtiyadan oo kale hoos u eegaan saxannadayada, waxay, liddi ku ah, koobiyeynta shinbiraha, kor u eegaan Bixiyaha weyn. Iidyada oo dhan - Nimco, waxaan leeyahay, isagoo leh, Wadaadka sare wuxuu ku furaa martiqaadka xafladda xusuusta ee jasiiradda; taas oo ah, in uu farahiisa quduuska ah gelinayo oo uu daahirinayo baaquli ka hor inta aan cabitaanka barakeysan wareegin. Isaga oo arkaya in uu Wadaadka ku soo xigay, oo uu xusayay xafladda, oo uu isu haystay in uu yahay Kabtanka markab- in uu si cad uga horraynayo Boqorka jasiiradda ah, gaar ahaan guriga Boqorka, Kabtankii si qabow buu u bilaabay in uu gacmihiisii ​​ku maydho godka feerka. ;-qaadashada waxaan u malaynayaa muraayad-fareed weyn. “Hadda,” ayuu yidhi Queequeg, “maxaad hadda u malaynaysaa?-Dadkayagu miyaanay qoslin?
    </p>
    <p>
       Ugu dambayntii, marinkii oo lacag ah, iyo boorsooyinku badbaado, waxaanu dul istaagnay iskoolka. Shiraaca kor u qaadaya, waxa ay hoos ugu dhaadhacday webiga Acushnet. Dhinac, New Bedford waxay kor u kacday barxadaha waddooyinka, geedahooda barafku daboolan yahay dhamaantood waxay ku dhalaalayaan hawo cad oo qabow. Buuro waaweyn iyo buuro fasaxado ah ayaa ku dul shidnaa seeraheedii, oo ay is barbar socdeen maraakiibta nibiriga ee adduunku aamusan yihiin oo ugu dambayntii si ammaan ah u goglan; Halka kuwa kale ay ka soo baxeen dhawaqa nijaarro iyo iskaashato, oo leh sawaxan isku dhafan oo dab ah iyo alwaaxyo si ay u dhalaaliyaan garoonkii, dhammaan waxay ku macneeyeen in safarro cusub ay bilowdeen; in mid ka mid ah safarkii ugu halista badnaa uguna dheeraa uu dhamaaday, uu hal ilbidhiqsi kaliya bilaabo; iyo ilbiriqsi dhammaatay, oo kaliya ayaa bilaabmaya seddexaad, iyo wixii la mid ah, weligeed iyo weligeed. Taasi waa dhammaadka la&#39;aanta, haa, dulqaad la&#39;aanta dhammaan dadaalka dhulka.
    </p>
    <p>
       Helitaanka biyaha badan ee furan, neecawda xajinaysa ayaa noqotay mid cusub; Moss yari waxay ka tuurtay xumbo degdeg ah oo qaansadeeda ka soo baxday, sida qayl yar oo uu hinaasay. Sidee baan hawada Tartar u nuugay, oo sidee baan u quudhsaday dhulkii rogrogga ahaa! oo ii soo jeestay inaan u bogi karo weynaanta badda oo aan oggolaan doonin wax diiwaan ah.
    </p>
    <p>
       Isla goobtii xumbo-fountain, Queequeg waxay u muuqatay inay wax cabbayso oo ila rogrogto. Dulalka sankiisa gabbal-dhaca ayaa kala baray; Ilkihiisa faylsan iyo kuwa fiiqan ayuu tusay. Waanu duulnay; oo falkeenii waa la helay, Moss ayaa ixtiraamay qaraxa; intay koolkoolisay oo qaansooyinkeedii quustay sidii addoon oo Suldaanka hortiisa ah. Innaga oo dhinac u janjeersanay, ayaannu dhinac u foorarnay; Xadhig kasta oo sida silig u ruxruxo; labada darood ee dhaadheer ayaa u soo gurmanaya sida bakoorada Hindida ee duufaannada dhulka. Haddaba waxaa ka buuxa muuqaalkan gilgilanaya, annagoo garab istaagnay gacma-qaboojiskii, in muddo ah ma aynaan dareemin jalleecyada dadka rakaabka ah, shir-beeleed u eg, oo yaaban in laba qof oo saaxiib ah ay sidaa isu weheliyaan; sidii nin cadi wax ka sharaf badan yahay negro cad. Laakin waxaa meeshaas ku sugnaa xoogaa boobies iyo bumpkins, kuwaas oo, cagaarnimadooda aadka u daran, ay tahay in ay ka yimaadeen wadnaha iyo xudunta u ah dhammaan xayndaabka. Queequeg waxa ay qabsatay mid ka mid ah geedahaas da&#39;da yar ee dhabarkiisa kaga dayanaya isaga. Waxaan u maleeyay in saacaddii qiyaamaha ay timid. Inta uu harbuuskii soo tuuray, ayuu dugaaggii bahaloobay gacmihiisa ku qabtay, oo mucjiso ku dhowayd iyo xoog, ayaa isaga oo jidh ahaan hawada sare u qaaday; ka dibna xoogaa taabtay dhabarka dambe ee badhtamihii-someset, saaxiibkii ayaa soo degay isagoo sambabo ka dillaacay cagihiisa, halka Queequeg, oo dhabarka u jeediyay, uu shiday dhuuntiisa tomahawk oo uu ii sii gudbiyay si aan u bararsado.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Qabsashada! Qabashada!” qeylo dhaanta, oo u orday dhanka sarkaalkaas; &quot;Qabsashada, Qabashada, waa kan shaydaan.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hallo, 
      <i>
        mudane
      </i>
       ,” ayaa ku dhawaaqay Kabtankii, oo feedhaha badda ka muuqda, oo ilaa Queequeg la soo booday, “maxay onkod uga jeedaa taas? Miyaadan ogayn inaad dishay cutubkaas?
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Muxuu leeyahay?&quot; Ayuu yidhi Queequeg, intuu si tartiib ah iigu soo jeestay.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Wuxuu igu yidhi,&quot; waxaan idhi, &quot;waxaad u soo dhawaatay inaad ninkaas halkaas ku disho,&quot; anoo tilmaamaya gees cagaaran oo weli gariiraya.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Kill-e,” ayaa ku qayliyey Queequeg, isaga oo wejigiisa tattooed u rogaya hadal aan la arki karin oo nacayb ah, “ah! isaga bevy yar-e kalluunka-e; Queequeg no dil-e aad u yar-e kalluun-e; Queequeg dila-e nibiriga weyn!
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Adiga eeg,&quot; Kabtankii baa qayliyey, &quot;Waan 
      <i>
        ku
      </i>
       dili doonaa, kaaga cuntami, haddii aad isku daydo wax badan oo xeeladahaaga ah oo halkan ku yaal; ee ishaada u fiirso.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Laakiin waxa dhacday markaas, in la gaadhay waqtigii Kabtanku uu ishiisa maskaxda ku hayn lahaa. Cadaadiska xoogga leh ee saaran shiraaca-weyn ayaa kala qaybiyay xaashida-cimilada, kobaca baaxadda leh ayaa hadda u duulaysay dhinac ilaa dhinac, iyada oo gebi ahaanba xaaqaysa qayb ka mid ah sagxadda. Miskiinka ay Queequeg si qallafsan u maareysay, ayaa la xaaqay; Gacmaha oo dhan baa argagaxay; iyo in la isku dayo in la dafiyo boomka si uu u sii joogo, waxay u muuqatay waalli. Waxay ka soo duushay midig ilaa bidix, iyo dib u soo laabatay, ku dhawaad ​​hal saac oo saacad ah, oo isla markiiba waxay u ekayd barta ay ka dillaacdo. Waxba lama qaban, mana u muuqan wax awood ah in la sameeyo; Kuwii sagxadda saarnaa waxay u yaaceen xaggii qaansooyinka, waxayna istaageen iyagoo indhaha ku haya kor u kaca sidii haddii ay tahay daanka hoose ee nibiriga xanaaqsan. Isaga oo argagaxa ku dhex jira, Queequeg ayaa jilba jilba joogsaday, oo ku dul gurguuranaya waddadii boomka, oo uu xadhig karbaash ah ku qabtay, oo uu hal daraf ku hubsaday dhufeysyadii, ka dibna sidii laasso oo kale u rogrogay, oo uu ku qabsaday boomkii. intay madaxiisa ka dul marayso, iyo gariirkii xigay, spaarku sidaas buu ku xannibmay, dhammaanna nabad bay ahaayeen. Dabaylihii baa la orday, oo intay gacmihii ka nadiifinayeen doontii dambe, Queequeg, oo dhexda ka siibtay, ayaa dhinac ka soo booday iyada oo geed dheer oo boodbood ah wadata. Saddex daqiiqo iyo wax ka badan ayaa la arkayey isaga oo sida eey u dabbaalanaya, oo gacmihiisii ​​dhaadheeraa si toos ah hortiisa u tuuraya, isla markaana is-rog-rogaya oo muujinaya garbihiisa jahawareerka leh ee xumbo barafaysan. Waxaan eegay saaxiibka weyn ee sharafta leh, laakiin ma arag mid badbaadiya. Gees cagaaran ayaa hoos u dhacay. Isaga oo si joogto ah uga toogtay biyaha, Queequeg, ayaa hadda si degdeg ah u eegtay hareerihiisa, oo aad mooddo in uu arkayo sida arrintu tahay, hoos buu u quustay oo waa la waayay. Dhawr daqiiqo oo kale, ayuu haddana kor u kacay, oo cudud weli soo baxaysa, oo tii kalena soo jiidatay qaab aan naf lahayn. Durbadiiba doontii ayaa soo qaaday. Bumpkin miskiin ayaa la soo celiyay. Gacmaha oo dhan waxay u codeeyeen Queequeg trump sharaf leh; naakhuudihii ayaa cafis weydiistay. Saacaddaas wixii ka dambeeyey waxaan sida barnacle u jeexjeexay Queequeg; Haa, ilaa uu miskiinka Queequeg qaatay quusistiisii ​​dheerayd ee ugu dambaysay.
    </p>
    <p>
       Miyir la&#39;aantaas weligeed ma jirtay? Uma ekayn in uu haba yaraatee bilad sharafeed ka mutaysanay Bulshooyinka Bini’aadantinimada iyo Sharafta leh. Waxa uu kaliya codsaday biyo-biyo cusub-wax uu ka tirtiro brine; Intaa uu yeelay, wuxuu xidhay dhar qallalan, oo uu shiday dhuunta, oo ku tiirsaday dhufeysyadii, oo si tartiib ah u fiirsaday dadka ku xeeran, waxa uu u ekaa in uu naftiisa ku leeyahay—“Waa duni la wadaago, oo la wadaago, dhammaan meridyada. Dadka cuna waa inaan caawinnaa Masiixiyiintan.

       CUTUBKA 14. Nantucket.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Ma jiraan wax kale oo ka dhacay tuduca mudan in la xuso; marka, orod fiican ka dib, waxaan si nabad ah ku nimid Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nantucket! Soo saar khariidadaada oo eeg. Bal eeg waxa geesta dhabta ah ee aduunka ay haysato; sida ay u taagan tahay, meel ka baxsan xeebta, oo ka cidlo badan guriga Eddystone. Bal u fiirsada - buur yar iyo xusul ciid ah; xeebta oo dhan, oo aan lahayn asal. Waxaa jira ciid ka badan inta aad isticmaali lahayd labaatan sano gudahood si aad u beddesho warqadda xoqidda. Qaar ka mid ah giraangiraha ciyaarta ayaa kuu sheegi doona inay ku beeri doonaan haramaha halkaas, si dabiici ah uma koraan; in ay soo dhoofiyaan yamaarugyada Kanada; in ay u diraan meelo ka shisheeya badda si ay u joojiyaan daadinta haanta saliidda; in xabbado alwaax ah oo Nantucket ah lagu qaado sida qaybo ka mid ah iskutallaabta runta ah ee Rome; in dadka halkaas ku nool ay ku beeraan saxarada gurigooda hortiisa, si ay hadh u hoos galaan xilliga xagaaga; in caws caws ahi uu sameeyo doog, Oo saddex caws oo socod ah maalintiiba caws buu samaysaa; in ay xidhaan kabo degdeg ah oo ciid ah, wax la mid ah kabaha barafka ee Lapnder; in ay aad u xidhan yihiin, guntan yihiin, oo si kasta loo xidhay, loo hareereeyey, lagana dhigay jasiirad badweynta agteeda ah, kuraastooda iyo miisaska ay ku fadhiyaanna waxaa mararka qaarkood laga helayaa saqafyo yaryar oo ku dheggan, sida qoolleyda badeedka dambe. Laakiin kuwan dheeraadka ah waxay muujinayaan kaliya in Nantucket uusan ahayn Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
       Bal hadda u fiirso sheeko-dhaqameedka yaabka leh ee ku saabsan sida jasiiraddan ay u degeen ragga cas-cas. Sidaas ayuu halyeygu ku socdaa. Waayadii hore gorgorku wuxuu ku soo duulay xeebta New England, wuxuuna ku qaaday ilmo yar oo Hindi ah. Iyaga oo aad u barooranaya ayaa waalidku waxay arkeen ilmahooda oo meel aan la arki karin ku dul saran biyaha ballaaran. Waxay go&#39;aansadeen inay raacaan isla jihadii. Iyaga oo doomahoodii sii raacaya, marin khatar ah ka dib, waxay ogaadeen jasiiradda, halkaasna waxay ka heleen sanduuq faaruq ah oo faaruq ah, - qalfoofka yar ee Hindida ah ee saboolka ah.
    </p>
    <p>
       Waa maxay haddaba, in kuwan Nantucketers, ee ku dhashay xeebta, ay u qaataan badda si ay nolol maalmeedka u helaan! Waxay markii hore qabteen carsaanyo iyo quhogs ciidda ku jira; Aad bay u xoog badnaayeen, oo waxay la soo baxeen shabagyo mackerel ah; waayo-arag badan, waxay ku riixeen doonyo waxayna qabteen koodka; ugu dambayntiina, waxa ay badda ku duuleen ciidammo badeed ah oo maraakiib waaweyn ah, waxay sahmiyeen dunidan biyaha leh; ku xidh suun wareeg ah oo aan kala go&#39;a lahayn; ku dhex fiiqay marinnada Behring; iyo xilli kasta iyo dhammaan badaha oo dhan waxay ku dhawaaqeen dagaal weligeed ah oo ay la galaan tirada ugu xoogga badan ee ka badbaaday daadka; ugu ba&#39;an iyo ugu buuraley! In Himmalehan, Mastodon-badeed-milix, oo huwan awoodda miyir-beelka ah, oo argagaxiisa aad looga baqo marka loo eego weerarradiisa ugu cabsida badan iyo xaasidnimada!
    </p>
    <p>
       Haddaba sidaas daraaddeed kuwan Nantucketers-ka qaawan, kuwan bad-mareennada ah, ee ka soo saaray buurta qudhaanjada ee badda ku taal, ayay u dul-mareen oo u qabsadeen adduunkii biyaha badnaa sida Alexanders badan; iyaga oo kala qaybinaya badweynta Atlaantigga, Baasifigga, iyo badweynta Hindiya, sida saddexda awoodood ee budhcad-badeeddu ay sameeyeen Poland. Ameerika ha ku darto Mexico Texas, oo Kuuba ha ku urursho Kanada; Ingriisku ha ku fido Hindiya oo dhan, oo calankooda cadceedda ka ololayana ha sudheen; Saddex meelood laba meel ka mid ah dunidan dhuleedku waa Nantucketer&#39;s. Waayo, baddu isagaa leh; isagaa iska leh, sida Imbaraadoorrada u gaarka ah; badmaaxiinta kale oo leh laakiin xaq u leh inay maraan. Maraakiibta ganacsigu waa buundooyinka ballaarinta; kuwa hubaysan laakiin qalcado sabayn; Xataa budhcad-badeedda iyo nimanka gaarka ah, in kasta oo ay badda u raacaan sida jid-wadaynimada, laakiin waxay dhacaan maraakiibta kale, jajabka kale ee dhulka iyaga oo kale ah, iyaga oo aan doonaynin in ay noloshooda ka soo saaraan gunta hoose. Nantucketer-ka, kaligiis ayaa deggan oo rabshado ka sameeya badda; Keligiis, luqadda Baybalka, wuxuu ku dhaadhacaa maraakiib; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. 
      <i>
        There
      </i>
       is his home; 
      <i>
        there
      </i>
       lies his business, which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
