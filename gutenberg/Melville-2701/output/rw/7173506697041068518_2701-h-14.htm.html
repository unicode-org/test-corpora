       Byari ijoro ryo kuwa gatandatu, kandi Isabato nkiyi yakurikiye! Ex officio abarimu bo kurenga Isabato bose ni whalemen. Pequod y&#39;inzovu yahinduwe isa nkaho ari shamble; umusare wese. Wagira ngo twatanze ibimasa ibihumbi bitukura imana zo mu nyanja.

       Ubwa mbere, imitwaro minini yo gutema, mubindi bintu bitangaje bigizwe nuruzitiro rwibisanzwe rusize irangi ryatsi, kandi ntamuntu numwe ushobora kuzamura - uruzabibu runini rwinzabibu rwarazungurutse hejuru-hejuru hanyuma rukubitwa cyane kuri hepfo ya mast-umutwe, ingingo ikomeye ahantu hose hejuru yubwato. Iherezo ryumugozi umeze nkurunigi ruzenguruka muri ubwo buhanga, hanyuma rikorwa ku kirahure cyumuyaga, hanyuma igice kinini cyo hepfo cyibisambo kizunguruka hejuru ya baleine; kuri iyi blok, ikinini kinini cya blubber, gipima nk&#39;ibiro ijana, cyari gifatanye. Noneho ubu yahagaritswe mu byiciro hejuru y’uruhande, Starbuck na Stubb, abo bashakanye, bitwaje amasuka maremare, batangira guca umwobo mu mubiri kugira ngo binjizemo ururobo hejuru gato yegereye impande zombi. Ibi byakozwe, umurongo mugari, uzengurutswe uciwe uzengurutse umwobo, urushyi rwinjizwamo, kandi umubiri wingenzi wabakozi bakubitaga amakorari yo mu gasozi, ubu utangiye guterana mu mbaga nyamwinshi y’ikirahure. Iyo ako kanya, ubwato bwose bwita kumuruhande rwe; buri bolt muri we itangira nkimisumari-imitwe yinzu ishaje mugihe cyubukonje; ahinda umushyitsi, ahinda umushyitsi, kandi yunamye imitwe ye yuzuye ubwoba yerekeje mu kirere. Ibindi byinshi yegamiye kuri baleine, mugihe buri cyuka gihumeka cyikirahure gisubizwa nubufasha buva mumasozi; kugeza amaherezo, gufata byihuse, bitangaje byumvikana; hamwe na swash nini ubwato buzunguruka hejuru no gusubira inyuma kuva kuri baleine, maze umutsinzi watsinze urazamuka ugaragara ukurura nyuma yacyo igice cyizengurutswe cyanyuma cyumurongo wambere wa blubber. Noneho nkuko blubber itwikiriye balale neza neza nkuko rind ikora orange, niko yamburwa umubiri neza nkuko orange rimwe na rimwe yamburwa kuyizunguruka. Kuberako umurego uhora ubikwa nikirahure cyumuyaga uhora utuma balale izunguruka hejuru mumazi, kandi nkuko blubber mumurongo umwe yikuramo kimwe kumurongo witwa &quot;igitambaro,&quot; icyarimwe ucibwa nicyuma cya Starbuck na Stubb, abo mwashakanye; kandi nkuko byihuse nkuko byaciwe, kandi mubyukuri nicyo gikorwa ubwacyo, ni igihe cyose kizamurwa hejuru kandi hejuru cyane kugeza impera yacyo yo hejuru irisha hejuru-hejuru; abagabo bari kumirahuri noneho bareka gutobora, kandi mumwanya umwe cyangwa ibiri misa itangaje itonyanga amaraso iranyeganyega hirya no hino nkaho yamanutse ivuye mwijuru, kandi buri wese uhari agomba kwitondera neza kugirango ayirukane iyo izungurutse, ubundi Ashobora gutwi ugutwi no kumutera hejuru.

Muri uyu mwobo, iherezo rya kabiri risimburana rikomeye noneho rifatwa kugirango rigumane kuri blubber, kugirango witegure ibikurikira. Aho, uyu musirikare wumuhanga winkota, aburira amaboko yose guhagarara, yongeye gukora siyanse ya misa, kandi hamwe na bake, kuruhande, kwiheba, gukata ibihaha, arayicamo kabiri; ku buryo mugihe igice gito cyo hasi kikirihuta, umurongo muremure wo hejuru, witwa igipangu-igice, uhindagurika neza, kandi byose byiteguye kumanuka. Abazamuka imbere noneho basubukure indirimbo yabo, kandi mugihe igisubizo kimwe kirimo guterura no kuzamura umurongo wa kabiri uvuye muri baleine, ikindi kigenda gahoro gahoro, hanyuma umanuka ujya kumurongo wa mbere unyuze mumihanda minini munsi yacyo, muri salle idatunganijwe yitwa blubber-icyumba. Muri iyi nzu ya twilight sundry nimble amaboko komeza utondekanye hejuru yigitambaro kirekire nkaho ari imbaga nini yinzoka zometse.

       UMUTWE WA 68. Igipangu.

    <p>
       Ntabwo nigeze nitondera cyane kuri iyo ngingo idasobanutse, uruhu rwa baleine. Nagize impaka kubijyanye na baleine b&#39;inararibonye bareremba hejuru, kandi nize abahanga mubidukikije. Igitekerezo cyanjye cyambere ntigihinduka; ariko ni igitekerezo gusa.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ikibazo niki, uruhu rwa baleine niki kandi nihe? Mumaze kumenya icyo blubber ye aricyo. Iyo blubber nikintu cyo guhuza inyama zinka zikomeye, zegeranye cyane, ariko zikaze, zoroshye kandi zoroshye, kandi kuva kuri umunani cyangwa icumi kugeza kuri cumi na kabiri na santimetero cumi neshanu.
    </p>
    <p>
       Noneho, nubwo ari ugukabya, birashoboka ko ubanza bisa nkaho bivuga uruhu rwikiremwa icyo aricyo cyose cyo guhuza hamwe nubunini, nyamara mubyukuri ntabwo arimpaka zirwanya ibyo bitekerezo; kuberako udashobora kuzamura ikindi kintu cyuzuye gifunze mumubiri wa baleine ariko icyo kibyimba kimwe; kandi igipfundikizo cyimbere yinyamaswa iyo ari yo yose, niba ari ubucucike bwuzuye, niki gishobora kuba uretse uruhu? Nukuri, uhereye kumubiri wapfuye utarongowe wa baleine, urashobora gukuraho ukuboko kwawe ikintu cyoroshye cyane, kibonerana, muburyo bumwe busa nuduce duto cyane twa isinglass, gusa birasa nkibyoroshye kandi byoroshye nka satine; ni ukuvuga, mbere yo gukama, mugihe bidasezeranye gusa kandi bikabyimba, ahubwo bigahinduka bikomeye kandi byoroshye. Mfite ibice byinshi byumye, nkoresha kubimenyetso mubitabo byanjye bya baleine. Biragaragara, nkuko nabivuze mbere; kandi nshyizwe kurupapuro rwacapwe, rimwe na rimwe nashimishijwe no kuba narigeze kugira uruhare rukomeye. Ibyo ari byo byose, birashimishije gusoma ibijyanye na baleine ukoresheje indorerwamo zabo, nkuko ushobora kubivuga. Ariko icyo ntwaye hano ni iki. Ibyo bintu bimwe bitagira akagero, isinglass, ibyo, ndabyemera, bishora umubiri wose wa baleine, ntabwo aribyinshi byo gufatwa nkuruhu rwibiremwa, nkuruhu rwuruhu, nukuvuga; kuberako byari bisekeje kuvuga, ko uruhu rukwiye rwa baleine nini rworoshye kandi rufite ubwuzu kuruta uruhu rwumwana wavutse. Ariko ntakiri muribi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dufate ko blubber ari uruhu rwa baleine; noneho, mugihe uru ruhu, nkuko bimeze kuri nini nini ya Sperm nini, izatanga igice kinini cyamavuta ijana; kandi, iyo bifatwa ko, mubwinshi, cyangwa kuruta uburemere, ayo mavuta, muburyo bwerekanwe, ni bitatu bya kane gusa, kandi ntabwo aribintu byose byikoti; igitekerezo runaka gishobora kuba rero gifite ubwinshi bwiyo misa ya animasiyo, igice cyacyo gusa ibice byacyo bitanga ikiyaga cyamazi nkicyo. Urebye ibibari icumi kuri toni, ufite toni icumi kuburemere bwa neti ya bitatu bya kane gusa byibintu byuruhu rwa baleine.

    <p>
       Mubuzima, ubuso bugaragara bwintanga ngore ntabwo ari buke mubitangaza byinshi atanga. Hafi ya buri gihe byose birarenze byambukiranya kandi byongeye kwambukiranya ibimenyetso bitagira ingano muburyo bunini, ikintu kimeze nkicyari mubishushanyo byiza byabataliyani. Ariko ibi bimenyetso ntabwo bisa nkibitangaje kubintu bya isinglass byavuzwe haruguru, ariko bisa nkaho bigaragara muri byo, nkaho byanditswe ku mubiri ubwawo. Ntabwo aribyo byose. Rimwe na rimwe, ku jisho ryihuse, ryitegereza, ibyo bimenyetso byerekana umurongo, nko mubishushanyo bifatika, ariko bigatanga ubutaka kubindi bisobanuro. Ibi ni ibyiciro; ni ukuvuga, niba uhamagaye ziriya siferi zamayobera kurukuta rwa piramide hieroglyphics, noneho iryo niryo jambo ryiza ryo gukoresha muri connexion yubu. Nkomeje kwibuka cyane ibyerekeranye na hieroglyphics kuri Sperm Whale imwe, nakubiswe cyane nisahani yerekana inyuguti za kera zabahinde zanditswe kuri palisade izwi cyane ya hieroglyphic ku nkombe za Mississippi yo haruguru. Kimwe naya mabuye y&#39;amayobera, nayo, amayobera-marike ya baleine akomeje kutamenyekana. Uku kwerekeza ku rutare rwo mu Buhinde binyibutsa ikindi kintu. Usibye ibindi bintu byose hanze yinyuma ya Sperm Whale yerekana, ntagaragaza gake inyuma, cyane cyane impande zayo, yagaragaye mugice kinini cyumurongo usanzwe, kubera ibishushanyo byinshi bitagira ikinyabupfura, byose hamwe bidasanzwe, bidasanzwe . Ndagira ngo mbabwire ko ayo mabuye yo mu Bwongereza Nshya ku nkombe z&#39;inyanja, Agassiz atekereza ko azashyiraho ibimenyetso byerekana ko akoresheje imirwanyasuri nini ireremba hejuru - Ndagira ngo mbabwire ko ayo mabuye atagomba kuba asa na gato na Whale Sperm muri iyi ngingo. Nanjye birasa kuri njye ko ibishushanyo nkibi muri baleine birashoboka ko byakozwe no guhura nabandi balale; kuberako nabivuze cyane mubimasa binini, byuzuye-byubwoko.

    <p>
       Ijambo cyangwa bibiri bindi bijyanye niki kibazo cyuruhu cyangwa blubber ya baleine. Bimaze kuvugwa, ko byanditswe kuri we mubice birebire, byitwa ibiringiti. Kimwe n&#39;amagambo menshi yo mu nyanja, iyi irishimye cyane kandi ifite akamaro. Kuberako baleine yapfunyitse muri blubber ye nko mu mwenda nyawo cyangwa kuri konte; cyangwa, biracyari byiza, umuhinde poncho anyerera hejuru yumutwe, akanyerera hejuru. Kubera iyo myenda itwikiriye umubiri we, niho balale ishoboye gukomeza kwisanzura mu bihe byose, mu nyanja zose, mu bihe byose, no mu nyanja. Byagenda bite kuri baleine ya Greenland, tuvuge, muri izo nyanja zinyeganyega, zifite urubura rwo mu majyaruguru, niba zidashyizwe hamwe na surtout ye nziza? Nibyo, andi mafi aboneka yihuta cyane muri ayo mazi ya Hyperborean; ariko ibi, byarebwa, ni amafi yawe yuzuye amaraso, amafi adafite ibihaha, inda nini ni firigo; ibiremwa, bishyushya munsi yikibara cya ice ice, nkumugenzi mugihe cyitumba yakundaga mbere yumuriro winzu; mugihe, nkumuntu, balale ifite ibihaha namaraso ashyushye. Hagarika amaraso ye, arapfa. Mbega ukuntu ari byiza noneho - usibye nyuma yo gusobanurwa - iyi nyangabirama nini, kuri we ubushyuhe bwumubiri ningirakamaro nkumuntu; mbega ukuntu bitangaje kuba agomba kuboneka murugo, yibizwa kumunwa ubuzima bwe muri ayo mazi ya Arctique! aho, iyo abasare baguye hejuru yinyanja, usanga rimwe na rimwe, amezi, nyuma, bikonje bikonje mumitima yimirima ya barafu, nkuko isazi iboneka yometse kuri amber. Ariko igitangaje kurushaho ni ukumenya, nkuko byagaragaye mubushakashatsi, ko amaraso ya baleine ya Polar ashyushye kuruta ay&#39;umuhengeri wa Borneo mu cyi.

       Njye mbona bisa nkaho, hano tubona ingeso zidasanzwe zubuzima bukomeye bwa buri muntu, hamwe ningeso zidasanzwe zinkuta zibyimbye, hamwe ningeso zidasanzwe zo kwaguka imbere. Yewe muntu! shimishwa no kwigana nyuma ya baleine! Nawe, komeza ususuruke mu rubura. Namwe, ubeho muri iyi si utarimo. Gira ubukonje kuri ekwateri; gumana amaraso yawe kuri Pole. Nka dome nini ya Mutagatifu Petero, kandi nka baleine nini, gumana, muntu! mu bihe byose ubushyuhe bwawe bwite.

       UMUTWE WA 71. Inkuru ya Yerobowamu.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Intoki mu ntoki, ubwato n&#39;umuyaga byahuhaga; ariko umuyaga waje vuba kurusha ubwato, bidatinze Pequod itangira kunyeganyega.
    </p>
    <p>
       Hafi yikirahure, ubwato bwumunyamahanga hamwe numutwe wa mast-imitwe byerekanaga ko ari ubwato bwa baleine. Ariko kubera ko yari kure cyane yumuyaga, no kurasa, bigaragara ko akora inzira yerekeza ahandi, Pequod ntiyashoboraga kwizera ko izamugeraho. Ikimenyetso rero cyashyizweho kugirango turebe igisubizo cyatangwa.
    </p>
    <p>
       Hano twavuga, ko nk&#39;amato ya marine ya gisirikare, amato y&#39;Abanyamerika ya Whale Fleet afite buri kimenyetso cyihariye; ibimenyetso byose byakusanyirijwe mu gitabo gifite amazina yubwato bujyanye, buri capitaine yahawe nayo. Kubwibyo, abayobozi ba baleine bashoboye kumenyana hejuru yinyanja, kabone niyo yaba ari kure cyane kandi nta kigo gito bafite.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ikimenyetso cya Pequod amaherezo cyashubijwe numuntu utazi ashyiraho ibye; cyerekanaga ubwato ko ari Yerobowamu wa Nantucket. Yikubita ku mbuga ye, arunama, atera abeam munsi ya Pequod, amanura ubwato; bidatinze byegereje; ariko, kubera ko urwego rwo ku ruhande rwarimo rusuzumwa n’itegeko rya Starbuck ryo kwakira kapiteni wasuye, uwo mutazi uvugwa yazunguye ikiganza avuye ku bwato bwe kugira ngo agaragaze ko ibyo bitari ngombwa na gato. Byaragaragaye ko muri Yerobowamu hari icyorezo kibi, kandi ko Mayhew, kapiteni we, yatinyaga kwanduza sosiyete ya Pequod. Kuberako, nubwo we n&#39;abakozi b&#39;ubwato bakomeje kutandura, kandi nubwo ubwato bwe bwari igice cya kabiri cy&#39;imbunda, kandi inyanja n&#39;umwuka bitangirika bikagenda bikagenda hagati; nyamara abigiranye ubwitonzi yubahiriza akato k&#39;ubwoba bw&#39;igihugu, yanze ko ahura na Pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ariko ibi ntabwo byigeze bibuza itumanaho ryose. Kuzigama intera ya metero nkeya hagati yacyo nubwato, ubwato bwa Yerobowamu bwakoresheje rimwe na rimwe ubwato bwabwo bwatekereje kugirango bugumane na Pequod, kuko yinjiye cyane mu nyanja (kuko icyo gihe yahuhaga cyane), hamwe umukunzi we-hejuru; nubwo, mubyukuri, rimwe na rimwe mugihe gitunguranye gitunguranye cyumuyaga munini uzunguruka, ubwato bwasunikwa munzira imwe; ariko byahita bizanwa mubuhanga muburyo bukwiye. Ukurikije ibi, nibindi bisa nkibihagarika nonaha, ikiganiro cyakomeje hagati yimpande zombi; ariko mugihe kitarangiye ntakindi kibangamiye ubwoko butandukanye cyane.
    </p>
    <p>
       Gukurura inkuge mu bwato bwa Yerobowamu, yari umuntu ufite isura imwe, ndetse no muri ubwo buzima bwa baleine yo mu gasozi aho abantu ku giti cyabo bagize byose. Yari umusore muto, mugufi, ukiri muto, amijugunyira mumaso ye yose, kandi yambaye umusatsi wumuhondo urenze. Ikoti rirerire, ryacishijwemo cabalistique ya kote yumutuku wazimye; amaboko arengana yazungurutswe ku kuboko. Delirium yimbitse, ituje, yabafana yari mumaso ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Iyi shusho rero ikimara kumanuka bwa mbere, Stubb yari yatangaye ati: “Nguwo! uwo ni we! - scaramouch ndende ya sosiyete ya Town-Ho yatubwiye! ” Stubb hano yerekanaga inkuru idasanzwe yavuzwe kuri Yerobowamu, numuntu runaka mubakozi be, hashize igihe ubwo Pequod yavugaga Town-Ho. Dukurikije iyi nkuru hamwe n’ibyakurikiyeho, byasaga nkaho scaramouch ivugwa yariyongereye cyane kubantu hafi ya bose muri Yerobowamu. Inkuru ye yari iyi:
    </p>
    <p>
       Ubusanzwe yari yararerewe muri societe yasaze ya Neskyeuna Shakers, aho yari yarabaye umuhanuzi ukomeye; mu nama zabo zacitse, rwihishwa zimaze kumanuka ziva mwijuru zinyuze mumuryango wumutego, zitangaza ko gufungura byihuse vial ya karindwi, yatwaye mumufuka we; ariko, aho, aho kuba irimo ifu yimbunda, yagombaga kuregwa laudanum. Icyifuzo kidasanzwe, intumwa zimaze kumufata, yavuye i Neskyeuna yerekeza i Nantucket, aho, hamwe n’amayeri yihariye y’ubusazi, yafashe icyemezo cyo hanze, gishyize mu gaciro, maze yitanga nk&#39;umukandida w’icyatsi mu rugendo rwa Yerobowamu. Baramusezeranya; ariko ako kanya ubwato bumaze kubona ubutaka, ubusazi bwe bwatangiye gushya. Yatangaje ko ari marayika mukuru Gaburiyeli, ategeka kapiteni gusimbuka hejuru. Yasohoye manifeste ye, aho yigaragaje nk&#39;umuntu utanga ibirwa byo mu nyanja na vikari-jenerali wa Oceanica yose. Umwete udashidikanywaho yatangarije ibi bintu; -umukino wijimye, utinyuka wibitekerezo bye bidasinziriye, byishimishije, hamwe nubwoba bwose budasanzwe bwa delirium nyayo, bahujwe no gushora iyi Gaburiyeli mumitekerereze ya benshi mubakozi batazi ubwenge, hamwe na ikirere cyera. Byongeye kandi, baramutinyaga. Nkumuntu nkuwo, ariko, ntabwo yari afite akamaro gakomeye mubwato, cyane cyane ko yanze gukora usibye igihe yabishakiye, capitaine udasanzwe yari gucika intege; ariko amenya ko icyo uwo muntu yari agamije ari ukumushyira ku cyambu cya mbere cyoroshye, umumarayika mukuru yahise akingura kashe ye yose hamwe n’ibikono bye - atanga ubwato n&#39;amaboko yose kugira ngo arimbuke bidasubirwaho, mu gihe iki cyifuzo cyakozwe. Yakoranye umwete cyane n&#39;abigishwa be mu bakozi, ku buryo amaherezo mu mubiri bagiye kwa kapiteni bamubwira niba Gaburiyeli yoherejwe mu bwato, nta mugabo muri bo wari kuguma. Yahatiwe rero kureka umugambi we. Ntabwo kandi bari kwemerera Gaburiyeli kugirirwa nabi, kuvuga cyangwa gukora ibyo ashaka; ku buryo Gabriel yari afite umudendezo wuzuye w&#39;ubwato. Ingaruka zibi byose nuko, umumarayika mukuru atitaye kuri bike cyangwa ntacyo yitaye kuri capitaine nabashakanye; kandi kubera ko icyorezo cyatangiye, yatwaye ukuboko gusumba mbere hose; gutangaza ko icyorezo, nk&#39;uko yise, cyari ku itegeko rye wenyine; eka kandi ntigomba guhagarara ariko ukurikije ibimushimishije. Abasare, cyane cyane abadayimoni bakennye, baranyeganyega, kandi bamwe muri bo barabyanze imbere ye; mu kumvira amabwiriza ye, rimwe na rimwe bikamuha icyubahiro ku giti cye, nk&#39;imana. Ibintu nkibi birasa nkibitangaje; ariko, nubwo bitangaje, nukuri. Ntanubwo amateka yabafana ari kimwe cya kabiri gitangaje cyane kubijyanye no kwishuka kutagira ingano kwabafana ubwe, nkimbaraga ze zitagira urugero zo kubeshya no kuryama abandi benshi. Ariko igihe kirageze cyo gusubira muri Pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ahabu avuye ku nkike, abwira Kapiteni Mayhew wari uhagaze mu bwato bw&#39;ubwato ati: “Ntabwo ntinya icyorezo cyawe, muntu.” “Injira.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Ariko noneho Gaburiyeli atangira ibirenge.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Tekereza, tekereza ku muriro, umuhondo na bili! Irinde icyorezo giteye ubwoba! ”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Gaburiyeli! Gaburiyeli! ” yatakambiye Kapiteni Mayhew; “Ugomba nawe -” Ariko ako kanya umuraba muremure urasa ubwato imbere cyane, kandi ibiboneka byarohamye imvugo yose.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wigeze ubona Ifi Yera?” yasabye Ahabu, igihe ubwato bwasubiye inyuma.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Tekereza, tekereza ku bwato bwawe bwa baleine, ziko kandi zarohamye! Witondere umurizo uteye ubwoba! ”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nongeye kukubwira, Gaburiyeli, ko -” Ariko na none ubwato bwarashwanyutse nkaho bukururwa na fiends. Nta kintu na kimwe cyavuzwe mu bihe bimwe na bimwe, mu gihe urukurikirane rw&#39;imivumba y&#39;uruvurungano yazungurutswe, imwe muri izo caprices rimwe na rimwe inyanja yatembagaye, ntabishyire hejuru. Hagati aho, umutwe w’intangangore yazamuye umutwe wihuta cyane, kandi Gabriel yagaragaye abireba afite ubwoba bwinshi kuruta uko umumarayika mukuru we wasaga nkuwabyemera.
    </p>
    <p>
       Iyo intera irangiye, Kapiteni Mayhew yatangiye inkuru yijimye yerekeye Moby Dick; ntabwo, ariko, nta guhagarika Gabriel kenshi, igihe cyose izina rye ryavuzwe, ninyanja yumusazi yasaga nkuwamurenze.
    </p>
    <p>
       Byasaga naho Yerobowamu itari imaze igihe kinini iva mu rugo, igihe yavugaga ubwato bwa baleine, abantu be bamenyeshejwe byimazeyo ko Moby Dick yabayeho, ndetse n&#39;amakuba yagize. Abigiranye umururumba yonsa muri ubu bwenge, Gabriel yihanangirije kapiteni kwirinda gutera Whale yera, mu gihe hagomba kuboneka icyo gikoko; mubusazi bwe butangaje, avuga ko Igifi cyera kitari munsi yikiremwa cya Shaker Imana yigize umuntu; ba Shakers bakira Bibiliya. Ariko, nyuma yumwaka umwe cyangwa ibiri nyuma yaho, Moby Dick yabonetse neza mumitwe yimitsi, Macey, mugenzi we mukuru, yatwitse cyane kugira ngo amusange; na capitaine ubwe ntiyashakaga kumureka ngo agire amahirwe, nubwo marayika mukuru yamaganaga kandi akabiburira, Macey yaboneyeho kumvisha abagabo batanu gukoresha ubwato bwe. Hamwe na bo asunika; kandi, nyuma yo gukururwa cyane, hamwe na onsets nyinshi ziteje akaga, amaherezo yaratsinze kubona icyuma kimwe vuba. Hagati aho, Gaburiyeli, azamuka mu mutwe-mukuru w’ubwami-bwami, yateraga ukuboko kumwe mu bimenyetso bikaze, kandi atangaza ubuhanuzi bw’urimbuka ryihuse ku bagizi ba nabi b’ubumana bwe. Noneho, mu gihe Macey, uwo bashakanye, yari ahagaze mu muheto w&#39;ubwato bwe, kandi n&#39;imbaraga zose zititaye ku muryango we yarimo atangariza amagambo ye yo mu gasozi, maze yandika kugira ngo abone amahirwe akwiye yo gutanga amacenga ye, dore! igicucu kinini cyera kiva mu nyanja; nigikorwa cyayo cyihuta, gifana, gukuramo byigihe gito mumibiri yabato. Ako kanya, uwo bashakanye udafite amahirwe, yuzuye ubuzima burakaye, yakubiswe mu kirere, maze akora arc ndende mu kumanuka, agwa mu nyanja intera ya metero nka mirongo itanu. Ntabwo ubwato bw&#39;ubwato bwangiritse, nta n&#39;umusatsi wo mu mutwe uwo ari we wese; ariko uwo bashakanye iteka ryose.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nibyiza kuringaniza hano, iyimpanuka zihitana uburobyi bwa Sperm-Whale, ubu bwoko birashoboka cyane nkibindi. Rimwe na rimwe, nta kindi gikomeretse uretse umugabo urimburwa bityo; akenshi umuheto wubwato urakomanga, cyangwa ikibaho cyibibero, aho umuyobozi mukuru ahagaze, yatanyaguwe aho gihererekeza umubiri. Ariko igitangaje muri byose ni ibihe, ko mubihe byinshi birenze kimwe, iyo umurambo wongeye kuboneka, nta kimenyetso na kimwe cyihohoterwa kigaragara; umugabo yapfuye rwose.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ibyago byose, hamwe nuburyo bwa Macey bwaguye, byamanutse mubwato. Kuzamura induru itobora - “Vial! vial! ” Gabriel yahamagariye abakozi batewe ubwoba n’iterabwoba gukomeza guhiga balene. Ibi bintu biteye ubwoba byambitse marayika mukuru wongeyeho imbaraga; kubera ko abigishwa be bizewe bizeraga ko yabanje kubitangaza, aho kuvuga gusa ubuhanuzi rusange, umuntu uwo ari we wese yaba yarabikoze, bityo bakaba bahisemo gukubita kimwe mu bimenyetso byinshi ku ntera yagutse. Yabaye iterabwoba ritagira izina ku bwato.
    </p>
    <p>
       Mayhew amaze gusoza ibyo yavuze, Ahabu amubaza ibibazo nk&#39;ibyo, ku buryo kapiteni w&#39;umunyamahanga atashoboraga kwihanganira kubaza niba yashakaga guhiga Ifi yera, niba bishoboka. Ahabu aramusubiza ati: “Aye.” Mu buryo butaziguye rero, Gaburiyeli yongeye gutangira ibirenge, yitegereza uwo musaza, maze aratangara cyane, akoresheje urutoki rwerekeje hasi - “Tekereza, tekereza uwatutse - yapfuye, kandi hepfo aha! - wirinde iherezo ry&#39;uwatutse!”
    </p>
    <p>
       Ahabu ahindukirira; hanyuma abwira Mayhew, ati: &quot;Kapiteni, mperutse kumpuza igikapu cyanjye; hari ibaruwa imwe mubayobozi bawe, niba nibeshye. Starbuck, reba igikapu. ”
    </p>
    <p>
       Buri bwato-bwato bukuramo amabaruwa menshi yubwato butandukanye, kubwo kugeza kubantu bashobora kubarizwa, biterwa namahirwe yo guhura nabo mumyanyane ane. Rero, inyuguti nyinshi ntizigera zigera ku kimenyetso cyazo; kandi benshi bakirwa gusa nyuma yimyaka ibiri cyangwa itatu cyangwa irenga.
    </p>
    <p>
       Bidatinze, Starbuck yagarutse afite ibaruwa mu ntoki. Yarasenyutse cyane, itose, kandi itwikiriwe neza, ibibabi, icyatsi kibisi, bitewe no kubikwa mu cyumba cyijimye cyakazu. Muri iyo baruwa, Urupfu ubwe rushobora kuba rwarabaye umuhungu.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ntushobora kuyisoma?” Ahabu arataka. “Mpa, muntu. Aye, aye, ni akajagari gato; - ibi ni ibiki? ” Mu gihe yarimo ayiga, Starbuck yafashe inkingi ndende yo gukata, maze icyuma cye kigabanyamo gato gato, kugira ngo yinjiremo ibaruwa, maze muri ubwo buryo, uyishyikiriza ubwato, butarinze kuza hafi y&#39;ubwato .
    </p>
    <p>
       Hagati aho, Ahabu afashe ibaruwa, aratontoma ati: “Bwana Har - yego, Bwana Harry - (ikiganza cy&#39;umugore, - umugore w&#39;umugabo, nzakora) - Yego - Bwana. Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam; —kuki ari Macey, kandi yarapfuye! ”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Mugenzi wanjye! umukene mugenzi wawe! no ku mugore we, ”asuhuza Mayhew; “Ariko reka ngire.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Gaburiyeli atakambira Ahabu ati: “Oya, komeza.” “thou art soon going that way.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck&#39;s hands, he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship&#39;s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel&#39;s eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab&#39;s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
       As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair.

       CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale&#39;s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster&#39;s back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Being the savage&#39;s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale&#39;s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the ship&#39;s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
       It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to Queequeg&#39;s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.
    </p>
    <p>
       So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another&#39;s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg&#39;s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*
    </p>
    <p>
       *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
    </p>
    <p>
       And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg&#39;s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
    </p>
    <p>
       Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
    </p>
    <p>
       But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. “Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you please.” Then watching the mate&#39;s countenance, he added, “The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we&#39;ll teach you to drug a harpooneer; none of your apothecary&#39;s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”

       “It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the captain&#39;s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a whale.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don&#39;t hit him again, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that sort; and this fellow&#39;s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity&#39;s gift, and that was freely given to the waves.

       CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk over Him.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale&#39;s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod&#39;s side. But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats, Stubb&#39;s and Flask&#39;s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel&#39;s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale&#39;s body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock.
    </p>
    <p>
       At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he turned upon his back a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
       While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation ensued between them.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat&#39;s bow, “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale&#39;s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale&#39;s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
       “I don&#39;t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he seems to know all about ships&#39; charms. But I sometimes think he&#39;ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don&#39;t half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake&#39;s head, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship? He&#39;s the devil, I say. The reason why you don&#39;t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he&#39;s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “He sleeps in his boots, don&#39;t he? He hasn&#39;t got any hammock; but I&#39;ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No doubt, and it&#39;s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye see, in the eye of the rigging.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bargain?—about what?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he&#39;ll surrender Moby Dick.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I don&#39;t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, &#39;I want John.&#39; &#39;What for?&#39; says the old governor. &#39;What business is that of yours,&#39; says the devil, getting mad,—&#39;I want to use him.&#39; &#39;Take him,&#39; says the governor—and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn&#39;t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I&#39;ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp—ain&#39;t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let&#39;s get the whale alongside.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship, “but I can&#39;t remember where.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn&#39;t the devil live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral&#39;s cabin, don&#39;t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that&#39;s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod&#39;s hold, and string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn&#39;t begin to be Fedallah&#39;s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn&#39;t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he&#39;s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me that?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But he&#39;d crawl back.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and drown you—what then?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I should like to see him try it; I&#39;d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn&#39;t dare to show his face in the admiral&#39;s cabin again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I&#39;m afraid of the devil? Who&#39;s afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn&#39;t catch him and put him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he&#39;d roast for him? There&#39;s a governor!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do I suppose it? You&#39;ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going on, I&#39;ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look here, Beelzebub, you don&#39;t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I&#39;ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he&#39;ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Didn&#39;t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you&#39;ll soon see this right whale&#39;s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti&#39;s.”
    </p>
    <p>
       In good time, Flask&#39;s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale&#39;s head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke&#39;s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant&#39;s and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.
    </p>
    <p>
       In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale&#39;s head, and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee&#39;s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab&#39;s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.
