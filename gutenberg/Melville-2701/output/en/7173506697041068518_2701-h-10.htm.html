      CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of
      the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles
      and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed
      one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain’s, on
      account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now
      stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly
      protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black
      cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark
      stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited
      turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head.
      Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,
      tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the
      Manillas;—a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and
      by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret
      confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose
      counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these strangers,
      Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, “All ready
      there, Fedallah?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away there,
      I say.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men
      sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a
      wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,
      off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like,
      leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the tossed boats below.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth keel,
      coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed
      the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly
      hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to
      cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again riveted upon
      the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not
      the command.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask,
      pull out more to leeward!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great
      steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew. “There!—there!—there
      again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay back!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it
      all before now. Didn’t I hear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I
      tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
      ones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom
      still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones, my
      boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are
      only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the
      more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils
      are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for
      a thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the
      gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts
      alive! Easy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why
      don’t you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so,
      so, then:—softly, softly! That’s it—that’s it! long and
      strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin
      rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.
      Pull, will ye? pull, can’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons
      and ginger-cakes don’t ye pull?—pull and break something! pull, and
      start your eyes out! Here!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle;
      “every mother’s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between
      his teeth. That’s it—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like
      it, my steel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,
      marling-spikes!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Stubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather
      a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
      inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
      specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
      with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
      peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone
      so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated
      merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer
      invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere
      joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent
      himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped—open-mouthed
      at times—that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer
      force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb was
      one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so
      curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter
      of obeying them.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
      across Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty
      near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
      please!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke;
      still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set like a
      flint from Stubb’s.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
      boys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad
      business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,
      Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what
      will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
      Stubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the
      play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
      diverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s
      what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
      suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom of
      it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men! It
      ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as
      the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
      awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s company;
      but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among
      them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some small measure
      prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder;
      and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of accounting for
      their appearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious
      surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of
      wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in the matter from the
      beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen
      creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the
      enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest
      to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance
      bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures
      of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose
      and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the
      boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi
      steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had
      thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the
      whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the
      alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end of
      the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer’s, thrown half backward into
      the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen
      steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the
      White Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar
      motion and then remained fixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen
      simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly
      the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had
      irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly
      discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab
      had observed it.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,
      stand up!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
      stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
      spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
      stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the
      gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself
      to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the
      vast blue eye of the sea.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Not very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its
      commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort
      of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of
      the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its
      top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand, and standing upon
      such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship
      which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little King-Post was small and
      short, and at the same time little King-Post was full of a large and tall
      ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means
      satisfy King-Post.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
      that.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
      swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
      shoulders for a pedestal.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
      fifty feet taller.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
      boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
      Flask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head and
      bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling
      landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was Flask
      now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband
      to lean against and steady himself by.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
      habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture
      in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and
      cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the
      loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask
      mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself
      with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble
      negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his
      broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked
      nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious
      little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added
      heave did he thereby give to the negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen
      Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth
      did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes.
      The whales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary
      dive from mere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in
      such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with
      his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant
      like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his
      thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper
      of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to
      windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect
      attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down
      all, and give way!—there they are!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
      visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
      water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and
      suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
      rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were,
      like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
      atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
      water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
      indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning
      couriers and detached flying outriders.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water
      and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass
      of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
      intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
      from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
      visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to
      his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the silence
      of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar
      whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      How different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something, my
      hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their
      black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you my
      Martha’s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay
      me on—lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!
      See! see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his
      head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far
      off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat’s
      stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
      unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short
      distance, followed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes,
      give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em.
      Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry’s
      the word. Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But what the
      devil are you hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only
      pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite
      your knives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take
      it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and lungs!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
      his—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the
      blessed light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the
      audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and
      eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask
      to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to
      be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its tail—these
      allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they would
      cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the
      shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out
      their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage pronouncing that
      they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these
      critical moments.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
      omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along
      the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the
      brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the
      knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to
      cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows;
      the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill; the
      headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;—all these, with the
      cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the
      oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her
      boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;—all
      this was thrilling.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
      heat of his first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering the first
      unknown phantom in the other world;—neither of these can feel
      stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time
      finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm
      whale.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more
      visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung
      upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere
      to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats
      were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead
      to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we
      rushed along; the boat going with such madness through the water, that the
      lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from
      the row-locks.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship
      nor boat to be seen.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet
      of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.
      There’s white water again!—close to! Spring!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that
      the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a
      lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and Queequeg,
      harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so
      close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the
      mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had
      come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants
      stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the
      mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of
      enraged serpents.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “That’s his hump. 
      <i>
        There
      </i>
      , 
      <i>
        there
      </i>
      , give it to him!” whispered Starbuck.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
      Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
      astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail
      collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
      something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew
      were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white
      curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended
      together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it
      we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
      tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the
      water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes
      the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of
      the ocean.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
      the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire
      upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these
      jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live
      coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that
      storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the
      shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen. The rising sea
      forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were useless as
      propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers. So, cutting the
      lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck
      contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif
      pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope.
      There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that
      almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man
      without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we
      lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the
      sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly
      Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard
      a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The
      sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge,
      vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last
      loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much
      more than its length.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
      tossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a
      cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more
      till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed
      against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on
      board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from
      their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us
      up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of our
      perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.

      CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair
      we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical
      joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects
      that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own. However, nothing
      dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all
      events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible
      and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion
      gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small difficulties and
      worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all
      these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and
      jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old
      joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man
      only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of
      his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing
      most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing
      like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial,
      desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the
      Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck,
      and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;
      “Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?” Without
      much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to understand
      that such things did often happen.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
      oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I
      think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
      mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
      then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
      squall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape
      Horn.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close
      by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell me
      whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an
      oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death’s
      jaws?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I should
      like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha,
      ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind that!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of
      the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in
      the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common
      occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the superlatively
      critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the
      hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow who at that
      very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft
      with his own frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster
      to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck’s driving
      on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that
      Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in the
      fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck’s
      boat; and finally considering in what a devil’s chase I was implicated,
      touching the White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I thought I
      might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said
      I, “come along, you shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their
      last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond
      of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had
      done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present
      occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart.
      Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that
      Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so
      many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived myself; my death and
      burial were locked up in my chest. I looked round me tranquilly and
      contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the
      bars of a snug family vault.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
      here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
      devil fetch the hindmost.

      CHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      “Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg you
      would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my
      timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask. “If
      his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That
      would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left,
      you know.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the
      paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right
      for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the
      chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes,
      whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest
      of the fight.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that
      with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
      considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
      extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
      comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man
      to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of
      the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his
      entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the
      chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his
      orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned
      to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for Captain Ahab
      to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat’s crew, he well knew
      that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the
      Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s crew from them, nor had he
      in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken
      private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco’s
      published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure
      when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the
      customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time
      after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of
      making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the
      spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which
      when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when
      all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an
      extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
      withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he
      evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is
      sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing the
      knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how
      often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
      semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter’s chisel
      gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these
      things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But
      almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in
      Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he
      had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.
      But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as
      to any boat’s crew being assigned to that boat.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away;
      for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such
      unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
      nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers;
      and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found
      tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats,
      canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself
      might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the
      captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the
      forecastle.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
      phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
      somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a
      muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this,
      by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked
      with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a
      half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even authority
      over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air
      concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people
      in the temperate zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but
      the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic
      communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent—those
      insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern
      days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal
      generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection,
      and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as
      real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and
      to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed
      consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical
      Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.

      CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept
      across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de
      Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la
      Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from
      St. Helena.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
      moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and,
      by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence,
      not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in
      advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked
      celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea.
      Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was
      his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out there, with
      the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though herds of whales
      were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering
      for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this
      old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon,
      companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there
      for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after
      all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery,
      moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some
      winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.
      “There she blows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have
      quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though
      it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so
      deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively
      desired a lowering.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
      t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best
      man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the
      piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving,
      lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many
      sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet;
      while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were
      struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive
      yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab’s face that
      night, you would have thought that in him also two different things were
      warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every
      stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this
      old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every
      eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more
      seen that night. Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
      after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it was
      descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
      disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
      night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into
      the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be; disappearing
      again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow seeming at
      every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our
      van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with
      the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the
      Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and
      wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however far apart
      latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same
      whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned, too, a sense
      of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously
      beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn round upon
      us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous
      potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath
      all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for
      days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild,
      that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating
      itself of life before our urn-like prow.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling
      around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are
      there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored
      the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the
      foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life
      went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.

      Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
      before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
      every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
      spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as
      though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing
      appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their
      homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black
      sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul
      were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.

      Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called of
      yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended
      us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty
      beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to
      swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air
      without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing
      its fountain of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before,
      the solitary jet would at times be descried.

      During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the
      time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,
      manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his
      mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft
      has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the
      issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So,
      with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand
      firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead
      to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but
      congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the
      forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over
      its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better
      to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
      sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened
      belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by
      painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift
      madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of
      humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the
      men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even
      when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose
      in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old man’s aspect, when one
      night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw
      him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain
      and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before
      emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the
      table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents
      which have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly
      clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that
      the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that
      swung from a beam in the ceiling.*

    <p>
      
      *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the
      compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the
      course of the ship.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale,
      still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.

      CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
      ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by
      name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head,
      I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean
      fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
      skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral
      appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her
      spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over
      with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to see
      her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in
      the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived
      nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast,
      they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship
      slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to
      each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one
      ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly
      eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while
      the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the
      act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand
      into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make
      himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the
      distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod
      were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere
      mention of the White Whale’s name to another ship, Ahab for a moment
      paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board
      the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage
      of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her
      aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home,
      he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round the
      world! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean! and
      this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address them
      to ——”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in
      accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that
      for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away
      with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with
      the stranger’s flanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings
      Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any
      monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
      There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep
      helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But
      turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the
      wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,—“Up
      helm! Keep her off round the world!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
      but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
      numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we
      left behind secure, were all the time before us.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
      ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than
      any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the
      voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented
      chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all
      human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they either lead
      us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.
