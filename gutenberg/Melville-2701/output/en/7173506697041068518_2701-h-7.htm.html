      CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as
      any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from
      the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of
      course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced by
      the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more
      ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now
      called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the
      Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time
      made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain’s
      authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the
      vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the
      Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland
      Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch
      official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At
      present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of
      the captain’s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good
      conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely
      depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important
      officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a
      whaling ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the
      grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live
      apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as
      their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded
      as their social equal.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this—the
      first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen
      alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in
      most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part
      of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the captain’s cabin,
      and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of
      all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the
      community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or
      low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common
      luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work;
      though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous
      discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an
      old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances,
      live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the
      quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.
      Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper
      parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any
      military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore
      the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given
      to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever
      exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man
      to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and
      though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected
      with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms,
      whether of condescension or 
      <i>
        in terrorem
      </i>
      , or otherwise; yet even Captain
      Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the
      sea.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those
      forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally
      making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
      legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,
      which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those
      forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
      dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what it will, it can
      never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without
      the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in
      themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps
      God’s true princes of the Empire from the world’s hustings; and leaves the
      highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous
      more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of
      the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead
      level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when
      extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances
      even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the
      case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire
      encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before
      the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
      depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever
      forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now
      alluded to.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness
      and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must
      not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him;
      and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied
      me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at
      from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied
      air!

      CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread
      face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master; who,
      sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of
      the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth,
      medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part
      of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would
      think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But presently, catching
      hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even,
      unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,” disappears into the
      cabin.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      When the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck, the
      first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck
      rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a
      grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,
      “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges
      about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see
      whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes
      up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner, Mr. Flask,” follows after his
      predecessors.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
      seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts
      of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he
      strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the
      Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up
      into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as
      he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by
      bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into the cabin doorway
      below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent,
      hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence, in the character of
      Abjectus, or the Slave.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
      artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some
      officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly
      enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers
      the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander’s
      cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and
      humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is
      marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this difference? A problem?
      Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon; and to have been
      Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have
      been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and
      intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited
      guests, that man’s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence
      for the time; that man’s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar’s, for
      Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has
      tasted what it is to be Cæsar. It is a witchery of social czarship which
      there is no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you superadd the
      official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive
      the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on
      the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential
      cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were
      as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk
      the smallest social arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all
      fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him.
      I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment
      with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the
      weather. No! And when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the
      slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards
      him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it
      tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the
      plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without
      circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the
      German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these
      cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at
      table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a
      relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the
      hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy
      of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his
      would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help
      himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first
      degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would
      he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,
      strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the
      chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask
      presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the
      ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny
      complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such
      marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him,
      a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is
      the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly jammed in
      point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they
      also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but
      a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon
      shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself,
      he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy
      usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask
      once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of
      an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be
      otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much
      relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction,
      thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer;
      but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the
      forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There’s the fruits of
      promotion now; there’s the vanity of glory: there’s the insanity of life!
      Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge
      against Flask in Flask’s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in
      order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a
      peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered
      before awful Ahab.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in
      the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order
      to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to
      some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers
      were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a
      sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and mighty cabin.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
      invisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free
      license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
      the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the
      sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food
      with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;
      they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.
      Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the
      vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain
      to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the
      solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a
      nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
      accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once
      Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy’s memory by
      snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden
      trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle
      preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering
      sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt
      baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the
      black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these
      three savages, Dough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver.
      Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they
      demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry
      adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door,
      till all was over.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his
      filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the
      floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low
      carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin
      framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship.
      But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say
      dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small
      mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,
      baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed
      strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his
      dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or
      by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal,
      barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so
      much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any
      marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear
      Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be
      picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
      round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the
      whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances
      and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would
      ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all
      tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his
      Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some
      murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white
      waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm,
      but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three
      salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering
      ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish
      scimetars in scabbards.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
      there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
      scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
      when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
      captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the
      ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
      anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the
      mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have
      lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was
      something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a moment,
      only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the
      open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no
      companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally included
      in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the
      world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as
      when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying
      himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his
      own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in
      the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!

      CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
      other seamen my first mast-head came round.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously
      with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen
      thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground.
      And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she is drawing nigh
      home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial even—then,
      her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles
      sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the
      hope of capturing one whale more.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very
      ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take
      it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians;
      because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their
      progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have
      intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet
      (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may
      be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God’s wrath;
      therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the
      Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is
      an assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists, that the
      first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly
      supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those
      edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those
      old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new
      stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a
      whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian
      hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and
      spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his
      food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance
      of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his
      place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing
      everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern
      standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and
      bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still
      entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any
      strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of
      Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the
      air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe,
      Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft
      on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars,
      his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
      will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his
      mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London
      smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
      smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
      Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to
      befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;
      however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick
      haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned.

    <p>
      
      It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers
      of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is
      plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of
      Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early
      times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit
      of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the
      sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,
      something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same
      plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying
      the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this
      custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head,
      that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from
      sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the
      helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of
      the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy
      meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the
      silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic
      stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the
      hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of
      the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite
      series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship
      indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you
      into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime
      uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
      with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary
      excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities;
      fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have
      for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more are snugly
      stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’ voyage,
      as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head
      would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that
      the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term
      of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching
      to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of
      feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a
      pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in
      which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch
      is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel
      sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t’ gallant cross-trees.
      Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he
      would standing on a bull’s horns. To be sure, in cold weather you may
      carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but
      properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the
      unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and
      cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running
      great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps
      in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere
      envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest
      of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of
      your watch-coat.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
      southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or
      pulpits, called 
      <i>
        crow’s-nests
      </i>
      , in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler
      are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the
      fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the
      Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the
      re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this
      admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a
      charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
      
      <i>
        crow’s-nest
      </i>
       of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s good
      craft. He called it the 
      <i>
        Sleet’s crow’s-nest
      </i>
      , in honor of himself; he
      being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous
      false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own
      names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise
      should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In
      shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe;
      it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable
      side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed
      on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch
      in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a
      comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and
      coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet,
      pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in
      person stood his mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he
      always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a
      powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales,
      or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot
      successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the
      water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was
      plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the
      little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he so enlarges
      upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account
      of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small compass he kept there
      for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called
      the “local attraction” of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the
      horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s
      case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among
      her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific
      here, yet, for all his learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass
      observations,” and “approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain
      Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic
      meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well
      replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his
      crow’s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I
      greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;
      yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that
      case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have
      been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the
      mathematics aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches
      of the pole.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain
      Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly
      counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive
      seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up
      the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with
      Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending
      a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take
      a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my
      ultimate destination.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but
      sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I—being
      left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude—how
      could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships’
      standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out every time.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
      Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
      lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
      offers to ship with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of
      such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be killed;
      and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the
      world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor are these
      monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery furnishes an
      asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men,
      disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar
      and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the
      mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase
      ejaculates:—
    
    </p>
    

    <div class="pgmonospaced">
            “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!

      <br/>
            Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”

      <br/>
    </div>
    

    <p>
      
      Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
      philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
      “interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to
      all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather
      not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists
      have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what
      use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses
      at home.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been
      cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale yet.
      Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.” Perhaps they
      were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon;
      but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious
      reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with
      thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at
      his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul,
      pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding,
      beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of
      some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive
      thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. In
      this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes
      diffused through time and space; like Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic
      ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
      gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the
      inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move
      your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes
      back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at
      mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop
      through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for
      ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!

      CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      (
      <i>
        Enter Ahab: Then, all.
      </i>
      )
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning
      shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway
      to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country
      gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
      rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
      dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did
      you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you
      would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one
      unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his
      nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought
      was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast
      and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as
      he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him,
      indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks
      the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing
      the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks,
      and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand
      grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
      ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not
      wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the
      weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing
      over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from
      his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy
      turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to
      pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb
      cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for
      the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long.
      Vehemently pausing, he cried:—
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
      voices.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
      hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
      thrown them.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “And what do ye next, men?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Lower away, and after him!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “A dead whale or a stove boat!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
      countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
      gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
      themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
      pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost
      convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
      whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a
      broad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men.
      D’ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly
      rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten
      its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to
      himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it
      seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
      with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other,
      and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises me a
      white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye
      raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his
      starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white
      whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed
      the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:
      “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water;
      if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more
      intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the
      wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately
      touched by some specific recollection.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that
      some call Moby Dick.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the
      Gay-Header deliberately.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a
      parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
      Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him—him—”
       faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though
      uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and
      wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock
      of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual
      sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a
      squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen—Moby
      Dick—Moby Dick!”

      “Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
      been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
      struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain
      Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took
      off thy leg?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
      hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
      brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted with a
      terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; “Aye,
      aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging
      lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with measureless
      imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him round Good
      Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round
      perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped
      for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all
      sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye,
      men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
      excited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for Moby
      Dick!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye, men.
      Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long face
      about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for
      Moby Dick?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
      Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came
      here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many barrels will
      thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will
      not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a
      little lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the
      accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
      girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let
      me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium 
      <i>
        here!
      </i>
      ”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it
      rings most vast, but hollow.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee from
      blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab,
      seems blasphemous.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,
      are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act,
      the undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing
      puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask.
      If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach
      outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is
      that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond. But
      ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,
      with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly
      what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale
      principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,
      man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then
      could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein,
      jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even
      that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye!
      more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou
      reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye,
      Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men
      from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let
      it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living,
      breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan leopards—the
      unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no
      reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they
      not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he
      laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the
      general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it?
      Reckon it. ’Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck.
      What is it more? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all
      Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has
      clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow
      lifts thee! Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
      
      voices thee. (
      <i>
        Aside
      </i>
      ) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has
      inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now,
      without rebellion.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did
      not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold;
      nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the
      hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts
      sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up with the
      stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on;
      the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye
      admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather are ye
      predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions from
      without, as verifications of the foregoing things within. For with little
      external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these
      still drive us on.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered
      them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near the
      capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood
      at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s company formed a
      circle round the group; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every
      man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the
      prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their
      head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden
      snare of the Indian.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
      nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
      draughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it
      goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
      serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
      way it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
      brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye
      mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with
      your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort
      revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will
      yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner. Hand
      it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer’t not thou St.
      Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me
      touch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three level,
      radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and
      nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to
      Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some nameless,
      interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery
      emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life. The
      three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb
      and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell
      downright.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but once
      take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       had perhaps
      expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead.
      Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye
      three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three most
      honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain the
      task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his
      tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       shall
      bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw
      the poles, ye harpooneers!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
      detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
      up, before him.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye not
      the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance.
      The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith, slowly going
      from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the
      fiery waters from the pewter.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
      them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!
      Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
      it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful
      whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not
      hunt Moby Dick to his death!” The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted;
      and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were
      simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and
      shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds
      among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they all
      dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.
