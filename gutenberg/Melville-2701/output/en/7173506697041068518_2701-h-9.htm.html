      CHAPTER 43. Hark!
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      “HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a
      cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the
      scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets to
      fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed
      precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle
      their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
      only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the
      unceasingly advancing keel.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose
      post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the
      words above.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a
      cough—it sounded like a cough.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers
      turning over, now!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits ye
      eat for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the
      bucket!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old
      Quakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re the
      chap.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
      down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I suspect
      our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one
      morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind.”

      CHAPTER 44. The Chart.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
      took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose
      with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and
      bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them
      before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you
      would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which
      there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional
      courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he would refer
      to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons
      and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm
      whales had been captured or seen.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
      head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw
      shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it
      almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on
      the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and
      courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
      cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
      brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others
      were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab
      was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more
      certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it
      might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
      creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to
      Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating
      the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling to mind the
      regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes;
      could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties,
      concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of
      his prey.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm
      whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could
      he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for
      one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the
      migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
      invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.
      On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
      charts of the sperm whale.*

    <div class="pgmonospaced">
           *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne

      <br/>
           out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of

      <br/>
           the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By

      <br/>
           that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in

      <br/>
           course of completion; and portions of it are presented in

      <br/>
           the circular. “This chart divides the ocean into districts

      <br/>
           of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;

      <br/>
           perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve

      <br/>
           columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each

      <br/>
           of which districts are three lines; one to show the number

      <br/>
           of days that have been spent in each month in every

      <br/>
           district, and the two others to show the number of days in

      <br/>
           which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.”

      <br/>
       
    </div>
    

    <p>
      
      Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
      sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret
      intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in 
      <i>
        veins
      </i>
      , as they are
      called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such
      undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart,
      with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
      direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel, and
      though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable,
      straight wake, yet the arbitrary 
      <i>
        vein
      </i>
       in which at these times he is said
      to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the
      vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual
      sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along
      this magic zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that
      breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be
      looked for.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
      feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
      the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art,
      so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly
      without prospect of a meeting.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
      delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps.
      Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for
      particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds
      which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will
      turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the
      preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances
      where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark,
      only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among
      the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former
      year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the
      Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow,
      that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent
      corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too,
      with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.
      But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to
      speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of
      accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only
      been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere
      a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would
      become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the
      next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were
      conjoined in the one technical phrase—the Season-on-the-Line. For
      there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
      periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun,
      in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of
      the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the
      white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds;
      there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the
      awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and
      unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this
      unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon
      the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to
      those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize
      his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
      Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander
      to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running
      down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to
      cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the
      premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly
      selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because,
      an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before
      him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would
      spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his
      vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should
      turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or
      China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons,
      Pampas, Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and
      Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
      Pequod’s circumnavigating wake.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not
      but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary
      whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual
      recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged
      thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of
      Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And
      have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after
      poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself
      back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins
      are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear! And here, his mad
      mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of
      pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to
      recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man
      endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps
      with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
      dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the
      day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round
      and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his
      life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the
      case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and
      a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings
      shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them; when
      this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through
      the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as
      though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead
      of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at
      his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at
      such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the
      white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent
      that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the
      eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time
      dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it
      for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the
      scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was
      no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with
      the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s case, yielding up
      all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by
      its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils
      into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could
      grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was conjoined,
      fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore,
      the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab
      rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless
      somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an
      object to colour, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old
      man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense
      thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for
      ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.

    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as
      indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in
      the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is
      as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter
      of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in
      order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any
      incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in
      some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
      content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items,
      practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these
      citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow
      of itself.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
      receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
      interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the
      same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private
      cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years
      intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may
      have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in
      the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore
      there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,
      where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by
      serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common
      perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile,
      the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it
      had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the
      coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came
      together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known
      three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales
      struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective
      marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year
      instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and
      last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole
      under the whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I
      say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are
      three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have
      heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter
      there is no good ground to impeach.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
      the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
      historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
      distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
      thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
      peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in
      that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
      peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
      valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of
      the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a
      whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen
      were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he
      would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to
      cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that
      happen to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive
      salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance
      further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
      celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
      famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but
      he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a
      name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not so, O
      Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long
      did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft seen
      from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou
      terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the
      Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they
      say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?
      Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old
      tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are
      four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or
      Sylla to the classic scholar.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
      times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
      finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by
      valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express
      object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods,
      Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious
      murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.

    <p>
      
      I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
      mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
      printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole
      story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one
      of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much
      bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest
      and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some hints touching
      the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might
      scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more
      detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
      perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
      conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One
      reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
      deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,
      however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose
      that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the
      whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the
      bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that that
      poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read
      to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular
      between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be
      called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you
      that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many
      others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death
      by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a
      boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles!
      not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man’s blood was spilled
      for it.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
      an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when
      narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,
      they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I
      declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,
      when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
      testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
      Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
      malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and
      sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale 
      <i>
        has
      </i>
       done it.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was
      cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats,
      and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales
      were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats,
      issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his
      forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than “ten
      minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has
      been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the
      land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once
      more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods
      shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time
      his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never
      tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.
      I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the
      tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed
      with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the
      catastrophe.*
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      *The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed to
      warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed
      his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short
      interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were
      calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby
      combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the
      exact manœuvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most
      horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from
      the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck
      three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.”
       Again: “At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all
      happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in
      my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many
      of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that
      I am correct in my opinion.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black
      night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable
      shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of
      being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks,
      with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, seemed
      scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and 
      <i>
        the
      horrid aspect and revenge of the whale
      </i>
      , wholly engrossed my reflections,
      until day again made its appearance.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “
      <i>
        the mysterious and
      mortal attack of the animal
      </i>
      .”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally
      lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of
      this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale
      hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then
      commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
      dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the
      harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the
      Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
      ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
      denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war
      as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is
      more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable
      craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm
      whale, that begged a few moments’ confidential business with him. That
      business consisted in fetching the Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that
      with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave
      down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s
      interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus
      converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale
      will stand no nonsense.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      I will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance in
      point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must
      know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s famous
      Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain
      Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we
      were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very
      clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
      our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till
      the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon
      large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost
      at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board
      till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon
      him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We
      were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,
      setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.
      The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below
      all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon
      some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost
      gravity and solemnity. Captain D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to
      examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock,
      but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
      question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures
      as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near
      Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I have particularly
      questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates
      every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian
      craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after
      bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,
      of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
      Dampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so like that
      just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
      corroborative example, if such be needed.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Lionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the
      modern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four o’clock
      in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the
      Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such
      consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to
      think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock
      was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck
      against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the
      lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * * The suddenness of the shock
      made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken
      out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was
      thrown out of his cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an
      earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a
      great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great
      mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the
      darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused
      by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
      me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
      than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
      boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
      withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
      Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me
      say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running
      sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured
      there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks
      off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm
      whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often
      with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his
      pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his
      character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and
      retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I
      must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a
      remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see,
      that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by
      plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels)
      are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say
      amen with Solomon—Verily there is nothing new under the sun.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of
      Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius
      general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every
      way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been
      considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some
      one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be
      mentioned.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of
      his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the
      neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels
      at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact
      thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is
      there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster
      was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other
      reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a
      sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the
      sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep
      waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,
      and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place
      for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have
      recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated
      instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am
      told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of
      the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of
      war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by
      the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance
      called 
      <i>
        brit
      </i>
       is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have
      every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale—squid or
      cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large
      creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at
      its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and
      reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all
      human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for half a century stove
      the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm
      whale.

      CHAPTER 46. Surmises.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
      thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;
      though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one
      passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
      habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether to
      abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if this were
      otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with
      him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his
      monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might
      have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that
      the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances
      that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one
      he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were
      still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according
      with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of
      swaying him.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the
      shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for
      example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over
      Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any
      more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for
      to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal
      relation. Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced will were Ahab’s, so long
      as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain; still he knew that for all
      this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain’s quest, and could
      he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It
      might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen.
      During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open
      relapses of rebellion against his captain’s leadership, unless some
      ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon
      him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick
      was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and
      shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some
      way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally
      invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn
      into the obscure background (for few men’s courage is proof against
      protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their
      long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to
      think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage
      crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all
      sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the
      varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when
      retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however
      promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things
      requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and
      hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
      mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
      The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
      Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
      hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
      breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the
      love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for
      their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric
      Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of
      land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,
      picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had they
      been strictly held to their one final and romantic object—that final
      and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will
      not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash—aye, cash.
      They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective
      promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once
      mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to
      Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat
      prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod’s voyage,
      Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid
      himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect
      impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end
      competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently
      wrest from him the command. From even the barely hinted imputation of
      usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression
      gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect
      himself. That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain
      and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to
      every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to
      be subjected to.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally
      developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree
      continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s voyage;
      observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to
      evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of
      his profession.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
      mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
      reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.

      CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.
    
    </h2>
    

    <p>
      
      It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about
      the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters. Queequeg
      and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an
      additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow
      preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie lurked in
      the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible
      self.

    <p>
      
      I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept
      passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long
      yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg,
      standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the
      threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly
      drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign
      all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting
      dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time,
      and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the
      Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single,
      ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to
      admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This
      warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own
      shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,
      Queequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof
      slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;
      and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding
      contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s sword,
      thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this
      easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free will, and
      necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working
      together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its
      ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only
      tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given
      threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines
      of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
      thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last
      featuring blow at events.

      Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
      strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
      free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence
      that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad
      Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand
      stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his
      cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard
      all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen’s look-outs perched as high
      in the air; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have
      derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.

    <p>
      
      As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly
      peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or
      seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing
      their coming.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Where-away?”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Instantly all was commotion.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
      reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other
      tribes of his genus.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
      disappeared.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      “Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”
     
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
      minute to Ahab.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
      before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
      leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
      our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
      when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
      concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the
      opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in
      action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego
      had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of
      the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not appointed to the
      boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The sailors
      at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their
      places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three
      boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs.
      Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail,
      while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long
      line of man-of-war’s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy’s
      ship.
    
    </p>
    

    <p>
      
      But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
      every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
      surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.
