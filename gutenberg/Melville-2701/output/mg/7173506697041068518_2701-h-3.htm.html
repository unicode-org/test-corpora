       TOKO 10. Sakaizan-tratra.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Niverina tao amin&#39;ny Spouter-Inn avy ao amin&#39;ny Chapel aho, dia nahita an&#39;i Queequeg irery tao aho; Niala tao amin&#39;ny Chapelle izy talohan&#39;ny tsodrano. Nipetraka teo amin’ny dabilio teo anoloan’ny afo izy, ary ny tongony teo amin’ny fatana fatana, ary tamin’ny tanany iray dia nihazona akaiky ny tavany ilay sampiny negro keliny; mibanjina mafy ny tarehiny, ary miaraka amin&#39;ny antsy mikisaka moramora eo amin&#39;ny orony, mandritra izany fotoana izany dia mikomy amin&#39;ny tenany amin&#39;ny fomba jentilisany.
    </p>
    <p>
       Fa nony voasakana izy, dia natsangany ilay sary; ary tsy ela dia nandeha teo amin&#39;ny latabatra izy, naka boky lehibe iray teo, ary nametraka izany teo am-pofoany ary nanomboka nanisa ireo pejy tamin&#39;ny fomba tsy tapaka; isaky ny pejy fahadimampolo—araka ny nitiavako azy—dia nijanona vetivety, nibanjina ny manodidina azy, ary niloa-bava tamin&#39;ny kiririoka nikoropaka naharitra ela. Dia hanomboka indray izy amin&#39;ny dimampolo manaraka; toa manomboka eo amin’ny laharana voalohany, toy ny hoe tsy afaka manisa mihoatra ny dimampolo izy, ary tamin’ny fitambaran’ny dimampolo maro be toy izany dia nampientanentana ny hagagany tamin’ireo pejy maro be.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tena liana aho nipetraka nijery azy. Na dia savage aza izy, ary simba tamin&#39;ny endriny - farafaharatsiny araka ny tsiroko - ny tarehiny dia mbola nisy zavatra tao anatiny izay tsy nahafaly mihitsy. Tsy afaka manafina ny fanahy ianao. Tamin&#39;ny alalan&#39;ny tombokavatsa rehetra nataony, dia nihevitra aho fa nahita ny dian&#39;ny fo tsotra tsotra; ary teo amin’ ny masony lehibe sy lalina, mainty mirehitra sy sahisahy, dia toa mariky ny fanahy iray izay hahasahy devoly arivo. Ary ankoatr&#39;izany rehetra izany, dia nisy fitondran-tena ambony momba ny mpanompo sampy, ka na dia ny fijangajangany aza dia tsy nahasakana azy. Toy ny lehilahy tsy nikiakiaka mihitsy izy ary tsy nanana mpampindram-bola mihitsy. Na izany aza, raha voaharatra ny lohany, ny handriny dia navotsotra tamin&#39;ny fanamaivanana malalaka sy mamiratra kokoa, ary toa mivelatra kokoa noho ny hafa, dia tsy ho sahy hanapa-kevitra aho; saingy azo antoka fa ny lohany dia tena tsara tokoa. Mety ho toa mahatsikaiky izany, saingy mampahatsiahy ahy ny lohan&#39;ny Jeneraly Washington, araka ny hita amin&#39;ireo satroka malaza azy. Nanana tehezan-davenona lava mihemotra tsy tapaka avy eo ambonin&#39;ny volomaso izy io, izay tena mitsivalana, toy ny tahon-kazo lava roa misy hazo matevina eo amboniny. Queequeg dia George Washington novolavolaina tamin&#39;ny fomba kanibalistika.
    </p>
    <p>
       Raha mbola nijery akaiky azy aho, nanao antsasa-manila teo am-pijerena ny tafio-drivotra avy eny amin&#39;ny gorodona, dia tsy niraharaha ny fanatrehany mihitsy izy, tsy nanahiran-tsaina ny tenany na dia indray mandeha monja aza; nefa toa variana tanteraka tamin’ny fanisana ny pejin’ilay boky mahatalanjona. Raha jerena ny fomba fiarahana niara-natory tamin&#39;ny alina lasa teo, ary indrindra ny fiheverana ny sandry feno fitiavana izay natsipy teo amiko tamin&#39;ny nifoha maraina, dia nieritreritra aho fa tsy niraharaha ny tena hafahafa. Fa zavaboary hafahafa ny bibidia; indraindray tsy hainao tsara ny fomba fitondrana azy ireny. Amin&#39;ny voalohany dia manjavozavo izy ireo; toa fahendren&#39;i Socratic ny fanangonany tena tony amin&#39;ny fahatsorana. Tsikaritro koa fa tsy nifanerasera mihitsy i Queequeg, na kely aza, tamin&#39;ireo tantsambo hafa tao amin&#39;ilay tranom-bahiny. Tsy nandroso na inona na inona izy; toa tsy nanam-paniriana hanitatra ny faribolan’ireo olom-pantany. Izany rehetra izany dia nanaitra ahy ho toy ny mahery; nefa, rehefa noeritreretina, dia nisy zavatra saika ambony tao anatiny. Indro nisy lehilahy iray teo amin’ny roa alina kilaometatra niala ny tranony, teo amin’ny lalana mankany Cape Horn, izany hoe—izay no hany lalana nalehany tany—natsipy teo anivon’ny olona hafahafa taminy toy ny tao amin’ny planeta Jupiter; nefa toa nilamina tanteraka izy; mitahiry ny fahatoniana faratampony; afa-po amin&#39;ny namany; mitovy foana amin&#39;ny tenany. Azo antoka fa fikitihana filozofia tsara izany; na dia tsy isalasalana aza fa mbola tsy naheno mihitsy izy hoe nisy toy izany. Saingy, angamba, mba ho tena filozofa, isika olombelona dia tsy tokony ho tonga saina amin&#39;ny fiainana na ny fiezahana toy izany. Raha vantany vao naheno aho fa ny lehilahy iray na toy izany dia manolotra ny tenany ho filozofa, dia manatsoaka hevitra aho fa, toa an&#39;ilay vehivavy antitra dyspeptika, dia tsy maintsy &quot;nanimba ny digester&quot; izy.
    </p>
    <p>
       Raha nipetraka teo aho tao amin’ilay efitrano manirery ankehitriny; ny afo miredareda ambany, ao anatin&#39;io dingana malefaka io rehefa, rehefa avy nanafana ny rivotra ny heriny voalohany, dia mamiratra ihany raha jerena; ny alokaloka hariva sy ny phantoms miangona manodidina ny takela-by, ary mibanjina anay roa mangina, irery; ny tafio-drivotra miboiboika eny ivelany amin&#39;ny fifohazana manetriketrika; Nanomboka nahatsapa fihetseham-po hafahafa aho. Nahatsapa nitsonika tao anatiko aho. Tsy nivadika tamin&#39;ny tontolon&#39;ny amboadia intsony ny foko tapaka sy ny tanako very saina. Io bibidia mampitony io no nanavotra azy. Nipetraka teo izy, ny tsy firaharahany dia nilaza toetra izay tsy nisy fihatsarambelatsihy sy fitaka tsy misy dikany. Wild izy; tena fahitana toerana hojerena; kanefa nanomboka nahatsapa ny tenako tamin&#39;ny fomba mistery nanatona azy aho. Ary ireo zavatra ireo izay mety hanosika ny ankamaroan&#39;ny hafa, ireo no tena mahasarika ahy. Hanandrana namana mpanompo sampy aho, hoy aho, satria ny hatsaram-panahin&#39;ny Kristiana dia nanaporofo fa fahalalam-pomba poakaty. Nataoko teo akaikiny ny dabilio, ary nanao famantarana sy teny sariaka vitsivitsy aho, nanao izay tratry ny heriny mba hiresaka taminy nandritra izany. Tamin&#39;ny voalohany dia tsy nahatsikaritra ireo fandrosoana ireo izy; fa tamin&#39;izao fotoana izao, rehefa niresaka ny amin&#39;ny fampiantranoana azy farany alina aho, dia nikasa hanontany ahy izy raha mbola hivady indray izahay. Nolazaiko azy hoe eny; izay noheveriko fa faly izy, angamba nidera kely.
    </p>
    <p>
       Niaraka namadika an’ilay boky izahay avy eo, ary niezaka nanazava taminy ny zava-kendren’ny fanaovana pirinty sy ny dikan’ireo sary vitsivitsy tao anatiny aho. Ka tsy ela dia nisarika ny fahalianany aho; ary nanomboka tamin&#39;izany dia nandeha nitsambikina izahay tamin&#39;ny fomba tsara indrindra azonay momba ireo toerana ivelany isan-karazany ho hita ao amin&#39;ity tanàna malaza ity. Tsy ela dia nanolotra setroka ara-tsosialy aho; ary, namokatra ny paosiny sy ny tomahawk, dia nanolotra ahy mangina izy. Ary avy eo dia nipetraka nifanakalo sefom-pofona avy tamin&#39;io sodinany io izahay, ary nitazona izany tsy tapaka teo anelanelanay.
    </p>
    <p>
       Raha mbola nisy ranomandry tsy niraharaha ahy tao an-tratran&#39;ny mpanompo sampy, ity setroka mahafinaritra sy mahafinaritra nanananay ity, dia tsy ela dia nanalefaka izany, ary namela anay mpiray tampo. Toa nentiny ho ahy araka ny fomba voajanahary sy tsy nampoizina tahaka ahy izy; ary rehefa tapitra ny setrokay, dia notsindriiny tamin’ ny handriny ny handriny, nofihininy tamin’ ny valahako aho, ary nilazany fa efa nivady izahay; midika hoe mpinamana amin&#39;ny taniny isika; faly ho faty ho ahy izy, raha ilaina. Ao amin&#39;ny mpiray tanindrazana, ity afon&#39;ny fisakaizana tampoka ity dia mety ho toa vao haingana loatra, zavatra tsy azo atokisana; fa amin&#39;ity bibidia tsotra ity dia tsy mihatra ireo fitsipika tranainy ireo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Taorian&#39;ny sakafo hariva, sy ny resaka ara-tsosialy sy ny setroka, dia niara-niditra tao amin&#39;ny efitranonay izahay. Natolony ho fanatitra ho ahy ny lohany voahosotra; naka ny poketrany lehibe paraky, ary nitsapatsapa tao ambanin&#39;ny paraky, dia namoaka vola telopolo dolara; avy eo namelatra azy ireo teo ambony latabatra, ary nizara azy ireo ho roa mitovy, nanosika ny iray tamin&#39;izy ireo nanatona ahy, ary nilaza fa ahy izany. Handeha hanohitra aho; nefa nampangina ahy izy tamin&#39;ny nandatsahany izany tao am-paosin&#39;ny kalesiko. Navelako hijanona izy ireo. Nandeha nivavaka hariva izy avy eo, namoaka ny sampiny, ary nanaisotra ny fatana taratasy. Noho ny famantarana sy ny soritr&#39;aretina sasany, dia nihevitra aho fa toa nanahy ahy ny hiaraka aminy; nefa fantatro tsara izay ho tohiny, dia nieritreritra kely aho raha toa ka manasa ahy izy, dia hanaiky aho na tsia.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kristianina tsara aho; teraka sy nobeazina tao an-tratran’ny Fiangonana Presbyteriana tsy mety diso. Ahoana ary no hiraisako amin’io mpanompo sampy bibidia io amin’ny fanompoam-pivavahana amin’ny tapa-kazony? Inona anefa no atao hoe fanompoam-pivavahana? Nieritreritra aho. Heverinao ve izao, ry Ismaela, fa ilay Andriamanitry ny lanitra sy ny tany—ny mpanompo sampy sy ny rehetra—dia mety ho saro-piaro amin&#39;ny hazo mainty kely? Tsy azo atao! Fa inona no atao hoe fanompoam-pivavahana?—ny manao ny sitrapon&#39;Andriamanitra— 
      <i>
        dia
      </i>
       ny fanompoam-pivavahana. Ary inona no sitrapon’Andriamanitra?—ny hanao amin’ny namako izay tiako hataon’ny namako amiko— 
      <i>
        dia izany
      </i>
       no sitrapon’Andriamanitra. Ankehitriny, Queequeg no namako. Ary inona no tiako hataon&#39;ity Queequeg ity amiko? Nahoana, miombona amiko amin&#39;ny fombam-pivavahana Presbyteriana manokana. Noho izany dia tsy maintsy miray aminy ao amin&#39;ny azy aho; ergo, tsy maintsy mivadika ho mpanompo sampy aho. Dia nandrehitra ny haratra aho; nanampy tamin&#39;ny fanohanana ilay sampy kely tsy manan-tsiny; nanolotra azy biscuit dorana miaraka amin&#39;ny Queequeg; Salama teo anatrehany indroa na intelo; nanoroka ny orony; ary vita izany, dia nanala akanjo izahay ary natory, nilamina tamin’ny feon’ny fieritreretanay sy izao tontolo izao manontolo. Tsy nandeha natory anefa izahay raha tsy niresaka kely.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tsy fantatro akory izany; fa tsy misy toerana toy ny fandriana ho an&#39;ny fampahafantarana tsiambaratelo eo amin&#39;ny mpinamana. Ny lehilahy sy ny vadiny, hoy izy ireo, dia manokatra ny fanambanin’ny fanahin’izy samy izy; ary misy mpivady antitra matetika mandainga sy mifampiresaka amin&#39;ny andro taloha mandra-maraina. Noho izany, tao anatin&#39;ny volan-tantely tao am-pontsika, dia nisy I sy Queequeg — mpivady milamina sy mifankatia.

       TOKO 11. Akanjo alina.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Nandry teo am-pandriana izahay, niresadresaka sy natory vetivety, ary i Queequeg dia nanipy am-pitiavana ny tongotro misy tombokavatsa volontsôkôlà teo ambonin&#39;ny tongotro, ary avy eo dia naveriny; tena nahay nifanerasera sy malalaka ary mora izahay; ary tamin&#39;ny farany, noho ny fisafotofotoanay, dia niala tanteraka ny fahasahiranana kely tavela tao anatinay, ary te-hifoha indray izahay, na dia mbola hidina lavitra aza ny andro ho avy.
    </p>
    <p>
       Eny, nanjary taitra be izahay; hany ka nanomboka nandreraka ny toerana nipetrahanay, ary nipetraka tsikelikely izahay; nifanizina tsara teo aminay ny akanjo, niankina tamin&#39;ny lohalika ary ny lohalikay efatra dia nifanatona akaiky, ary ny oronay roa dia niondrika teo amboniny, toy ny hoe fatana fanafana ny lohalikay. Tsapanay fa tena milay sy mendri-piderana izahay, mainka fa satria nangatsiaka be teo am-baravarana; fa tsy nisy afo tao amin&#39;ny efi-trano. Vao mainka izany, hoy aho, satria raha te hankafy ny hafanan&#39;ny vatana tokoa, dia tsy maintsy mangatsiaka ny ampahany kely aminareo, satria tsy misy toetra eto amin&#39;ity tontolo ity izay tsy mitovy amin&#39;ny mifanohitra amin&#39;izany fotsiny. Tsy misy na inona na inona ao aminy. Raha mandoka tena ianao hoe mahazo aina daholo, ary efa ela be, dia tsy azo lazaina hoe mahazo aina intsony ianao. Fa raha toa izaho sy i Queequeg eo am-pandriana, dia somary mangatsiatsiaka ny tendron&#39;ny oronao na ny satroboninahitry ny lohanao, nahoana ary tokoa, amin&#39;ny fahatsiarovan-tena amin&#39;ny ankapobeny dia mahatsiaro tena mahafinaritra sy tsy hay hadinoina ianao. Noho izany antony izany dia tsy tokony ho feno afo mihitsy ny trano fatoriana, izay iray amin&#39;ireo fahasahiranana mirentirenty ho an&#39;ny mpanankarena. Satria ny haavon&#39;ny karazan-tsakafo toy izany dia ny tsy fisian&#39;ny zavatra hafa afa-tsy ny bodofotsy eo anelanelanao sy ny hatsembohanao ary ny hatsiaka amin&#39;ny rivotra ivelany. Avy eo ianao dia mandry toy ny pitik&#39;afo mafana ao am-pon&#39;ny krystaly Arktika.
    </p>
    <p>
       Efa elaela ihany izahay no nipetraka teo amin’io fomba niondrika io, ka tonga dia nihevitra aho fa hanokatra ny masoko; fa rehefa eo anelanelan&#39;ny lamba firakotra, na antoandro na alina, ary na matory na mifoha, dia manana fomba hanakimpy foana ny masoko aho, mba hampifantoka bebe kokoa ny fahasahiranana eo am-pandriana. Satria tsy misy olona afaka mahatsapa tsara ny maha-izy azy raha tsy mikipy ny masony; toy ny hoe ny haizina tokoa no singa mety amin&#39;ny maha-izy antsika, na dia mety kokoa amin&#39;ny tanimanga aza ny hazavana. Rehefa nanokatra ny masoko tamin&#39;izay aho, ary nivoaka avy tao amin&#39;ny haizina mahafinaritra sy noforoniko manokana ho ao anatin&#39;ny haizina ivelany tsy misy hazavana amin&#39;ny roa ambin&#39;ny folo amin&#39;ny alina, dia niaina fikomiana tsy nahafaly ahy. Izaho koa dia tsy nanohitra velively ny teny avy amin&#39;i Queequeg fa angamba tsara kokoa ny mamely jiro, satria mifoha be izahay; ary ankoatr&#39;izay dia nahatsapa faniriana mafy izy ny hanana tsipìka mangina vitsivitsy avy amin&#39;ny Tomahawk-ny. Azo lazaina fa na dia nahatsapa fahasosorana mafy toy izany aza aho tamin&#39;ny fifohana sigara teo am-pandriana ny alina talohan&#39;izay, dia jereo ny fihenjanan&#39;ny fitsaratsaram-poanay mafy rehefa tonga ny fitiavana mba hanongotra azy ireo. Amin&#39;izao fotoana izao dia tsy misy zavatra tiako kokoa noho ny nifoka sigara teo anilako i Queequeg, na dia teo am-pandriana aza, satria toa feno fifaliana ao an-tokantrano tony izy tamin&#39;izany. Tsy niahiahy loatra intsony aho tamin&#39;ny politikan&#39;ny fiantohana ny tompon-trano. Tsy niaina afa-tsy tamin&#39;ny fahasahiranana mifono tsiambaratelo amin&#39;ny fizarana fantsona sy bodofotsy amin&#39;ny tena namana aho. Miaraka amin&#39;ny palitao manjavozavo natao teo amin&#39;ny sorokay, dia nandalo ny Tomahawk izahay, mandra-pahatongan&#39;ny tsimokaretina manga mihantona eo amboninay, nohazavain&#39;ny lelafon&#39;ilay jiro vaovao.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tsy fantatro na io mpanandrana mihodinkodina io no nanakodia ilay bibidia nankany amin&#39;ny toerana lavitra, fa niresaka momba ny nosy niaviany izy izao; ary, te-handre ny tantarany aho, dia niangavy azy mba hanohy hilaza izany. Nanaiky tamim-pifaliana izy. Na dia tsy nahatakatra firy tamin&#39;ny teniny aza aho tamin&#39;izany fotoana izany, ny fanambarana manaraka, rehefa nanjary nahafantatra bebe kokoa ny fehezan-teny tapaka aho, dia izao no nahafahako nanolotra ny tantara manontolo izay mety ho porofoina amin&#39;ny taolam-paty fotsiny.

       TOKO 12. Tantaram-piainana.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Teratany Rokovoko, nosy lavitra ny Andrefana sy Atsimo i Queequeg. Tsy midina amin&#39;ny sarintany rehetra izany; tsy misy mihitsy ny toerana tena izy.
    </p>
    <p>
       Rehefa misy bibidia vao foy mandehandeha manodidina ny ala tanindrazany amin&#39;ny ahitra, arahin&#39;ireo osilahy mikitikitika, toy ny zana-kazo maitso; Na dia izany aza, tao amin&#39;ny fanahin&#39;i Queequeg fatra-paniry laza, dia nanintona faniriana mafy ny hahita zavatra bebe kokoa momba ny Kristianisma Anarana noho ny mpihaza trozona iray na roa. Lehiben’ny Avo, Mpanjaka ny rainy; ny dadatoany dia Mpisoronabe; ary teo amin&#39;ny lafiny reny dia nireharehany ny nenitoany izay vadin&#39;ny mpiady tsy resy. Nisy rà faran&#39;izay tsara tao amin&#39;ny lalan-drany—fananan&#39;ny mpanjaka; na dia nampalahelo aza, matahotra aho, noho ny fironan&#39;ny fihinanan-kaniny nokolokoloiny tamin&#39;ny fahatanorany tsy nianatra.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nisy sambo Sag Harbor nitsidika ny helodranon-drainy, ary i Queequeg dia nitady lalana ho any amin’ny tany kristiana. Fa ny sambo, izay feno tantsambo, dia nandà ny akanjony; ary tsy ny fitaoman-drainy rehetra no naharesy. Nivoady anefa i Queequeg. Irery tao anaty lakana izy, dia nivoy nankany amin&#39;ny andilan-tany lavitra, izay fantany fa tsy maintsy nandalovan&#39;ilay sambo rehefa niala tamin&#39;ilay nosy izy. Teo amin’ny lafiny iray dia nisy haran-dranomasina; amin&#39;ny ilany kosa ny lelan-tany iva, rakotra ala honko izay nipoitra tao anaty rano. Niafina teo amin’ireo kirihitrala ireo ny lakany, izay mbola mitsinkafona, ary mitodika any an-dranomasina ny vodiny, dia nipetraka teo am-bodin’ny sambo izy, nivoy ambany tamin’ny tanany; ary raha nandalo ny sambo, dia nitsoaka toy ny tselatra izy; nahazo ny lafiny; tamin&#39;ny dian-tongony iray mihemotra dia nivadika ka nampilentika ny lakany; nananika ny rojo; ary nianjera tanteraka teo amin&#39;ny tokotanin-tsambo, dia nasiany peratra teo, ary nianiana tsy hamela izany, na dia nopotehina aza.
    </p>
    <p>
       Foana ny fandrahonan’ny kapiteny hanipy azy any an-dranomasina; nahantona cutlass teo amin&#39;ny hato-tanany miboridana; Zanaky ny mpanjaka i Queequeg, ary tsy nihetsika i Queequeg. Tohina noho ny fahasahiranany sy ny faniriany mihoa-pampana ny hitsidika ny Kristianisma Anarana, ka nilefitra ihany ilay kapiteny tamin’ny farany, ary nilaza taminy fa mety hody any an-tranony izy. Saingy tsy nahita ny tranoben&#39;ny Kapiteny mihitsy ity bibidia tanora mahafatifaty ity - ity Printsin&#39;i Pays de Galles ity. Dia napetrany teo afovoan&#39;ny tantsambo izy, ka nataony sambo-belona. Saingy toa an&#39;i Czar Peter izay nionona tamin&#39;ny fisasarana tao amin&#39;ny tobin&#39;ny tanàn-dehibe hafa, i Queequeg dia tsy nanao tsinontsinona izay toa fahafaham-baraka, raha toa ka azony atao amim-pifaliana ny hery manazava ny mpiray tanindrazana aminy tsy nahay. Fa tamin’ny farany—ka hoy izy tamiko—dia notarihin’ny faniriana lalina hianatra teo anivon’ny Kristiana izy, ny zavakanto izay hahatonga ny olony ho sambatra kokoa noho izy ireo; ary mihoatra noho izany, mbola tsara noho izy ireo. Nefa indrisy! tsy ela dia nandresy lahatra azy ny fanaon’ny mpihaza trozona fa na dia ny Kristianina aza dia mety ho ory sy ratsy fanahy; mihoatra lavitra noho ny jentilisa rehetra ny rainy. Tonga ihany tamin&#39;ny farany tao amin&#39;ny Sag Harbor taloha; ary hitany izay nataon&#39;ny tantsambo teo; ary avy eo dia nankany Nantucket, ary nahita ny nandaniany ny karamany teo amin&#39;io toerana 
      <i>
        io
      </i>
       koa, dia natolotr&#39;i Queequeg mahantra izany ho very. Nihevitra izy fa izao tontolo izao ratsy amin&#39;ny meridiana rehetra; Ho faty mpanompo sampy aho.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ary noho izany dia mpanompo sampy taloha tao am-pony, mbola nitoetra teo anivon’ireo Kristiana ireo izy, nanao ny fitafiany, ary niezaka niresaka ny hadalana. Noho izany, ny fomba hafahafa momba azy, na dia tsy ao an-trano aza.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nanontany azy aho tamin&#39;ny alalan&#39;ny fanoroana hevitra raha toa ka tsy miroso amin&#39;ny fiverenana izy, ary hanao fanotronana; satria mety hoheveriny fa maty ny rainy ka lasa, fa efa antitra sy osa izy tamin&#39;ny farany. Tsia no navaliny, tsy mbola; ary nampiany koa fa Kristiana mahatahotra izy, na ny marimarina kokoa hoe Kristiana, dia tsy mendrika azy hiakatra eo amin’ny seza fiandrianana madio sy tsy misy loto, an’ireo Mpanjaka mpanompo sampy telopolo teo alohany. Saingy vetivety, hoy izy, dia hiverina,—raha vao nahatsapa ny tenany ho vita batisa indray izy. Na dia izany aza, dia nanolo-kevitra ny hiondrana an-tsambo izy, ary hamafy ny voany any amin&#39;ny ranomasina efatra. Nanao harpooneer momba azy izy ireo, ary io vy misy barazy io dia solon’ny tehim-panjakana ankehitriny.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nanontany azy aho hoe inona no mety ho tanjony eo no ho eo, mikasika ny hetsika ho avy. Namaly izy hoe handeha an-dranomasina indray, amin’ny fiantsoana azy taloha. Tamin&#39;izany dia nolazaiko azy fa ny filalaovana trozona no noforoniko manokana, ary nampahafantariko azy ny fikasako hivoaka an&#39;i Nantucket, ho seranan-tsambo nampanantenaina indrindra hiaingan&#39;ny mpihaza trozona iray. Nanapa-kevitra avy hatrany izy fa hiaraka amiko ho any amin’io nosy io, hiondrana an-tsambo amin’io sambo io ihany, hiditra ao amin’ilay fiambenana iray ihany, sambo iray ihany, korontana mitovy amiko, raha fintinina, hizara ny hap rehetra; miaraka amin&#39;ny tanako roa eny an-tanany, milomano amim-pahasahiana ao amin&#39;ny Potluck an&#39;ny tontolo roa. Nanaiky izany rehetra izany aho; fa ankoatra ny firaiketam-po tsapako ho an&#39;i Queequeg ankehitriny, dia efa za-draharaha amin&#39;ny harpooneer izy, ary noho izany, dia tsy azo lavina fa tena ilaina ho an&#39;ny olona iray, izay, toa ahy, dia tsy nahalala tanteraka ny misterin&#39;ny trozona, na dia nahafantatra tsara ny ranomasina, araka ny fantatry ny tantsambo mpivarotra.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nifarana tamin&#39;ny sodina maty farany tamin&#39;ny sodina ny tantarany, namihina ahy i Queequeg, nanosika ny handriny teo amin&#39;ny handriny, ary nitsoka ny jiro, nifandona izahay, tetsy sy teroa, ary vetivety dia natory.

       TOKO 13. Sarety.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Ny ampitso maraina, ny Alatsinainy, rehefa avy nanary ny lohan&#39;ny voahosotra tany amin&#39;ny mpanety iray aho, dia nandamina ny faktioran&#39;ny tenako sy ny namako; mampiasa ny volan&#39;ny namako anefa. Ilay tompon-trano mitsiky, ary koa ireo tompon-trano, dia toa nahavariana tokoa ny fisakaizana tampoka nipoitra teo amiko sy i Queequeg — indrindra fa ny tantaran&#39;ny akoho sy omby nataon&#39;i Peter Coffin momba azy teo aloha dia nanaitra ahy ny momba ilay olona niaraka tamiko ankehitriny. miaraka amin&#39;ny.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nindrana kodiaran-tsarety izahay, ary niditra tao amin&#39;ny entanay, anisan&#39;izany ny kitapom-baravarankely mahantra, sy ny gony sy ny lambam-paty an&#39;i Queequeg, dia nidina nankany amin&#39;ny “Moss”, ilay scooner kely packet Nantucket izay nijanona teo amin&#39;ny seranana. Raha nandeha izahay, dia nibanjina ny olona; tsy tao Queequeg loatra—fa efa zatra nahita mpihinan-kanina toa azy teny an-dalambe izy ireo,-fa tamin&#39;ny fahitana azy sy izaho tamin&#39;ny teny tsiambaratelo toy izany. Tsy niraharaha azy ireo anefa izahay, fa nandeha nifandimby nandeha tamin&#39;ny kodiaran&#39;ny satety, ary nijanona i Queequeg indraindray mba hanitsy ny fonony amin&#39;ny barany. Nanontany azy aho hoe nahoana izy no nitondra zavatra manahirana toy izany niaraka taminy teny an-tanety, ary raha tsy nahita ny harpony manokana ny sambo mpihaza trozona rehetra. Raha ny marina, dia namaly izy fa na dia marina aza ny zavatra nolazaiko, dia nanana firaiketam-po manokana ho an&#39;ny harpony manokana izy, satria zavatra azo antoka izany, voazaha toetra tsara tamin&#39;ny ady mety maty maro, ary tena akaiky ny fo. ny trozona. Raha fintinina, toy ny mpijinja sy mpikapa hazo maro any an-tanety, izay mandeha any amin&#39;ny tanimbolin&#39;ny tantsaha mitam-piadiana miaraka amin&#39;ny saviny manokana—na dia tsy voatery hanome azy ireo mihitsy aza—na izany aza, dia naleon&#39;i Queequeg, noho ny antony manokana, ny harpony manokana.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nafindrany teo amin’ny tanako ho any amin’ny tanany ilay sarety, ary nitantara tamiko tantara mahatsikaiky momba ilay sarety voalohany hitany izy. Tao amin’ny Sag Harbor no nisy azy. Toa nampindrana azy ny tompon’ny sambony, mba hitondrana ny tratrany mavesatra ho any amin’ny trano ipetrahany. Mba tsy ho toy ny tsy mahalala ny amin&#39;ilay zavatra—na dia izany aza no izy, raha ny marina, momba ny fomba marina hitantanana ny satro-boninahitra—Nametraka ny tratrany teo amboniny i Queequeg; mikapoka azy haingana; ary avy eo dia mitsambikina ny soroka ary miakatra ny seranana. &quot;Nahoana,&quot; hoy aho, &quot;Queequeg, mety ho nahafantatra tsara kokoa noho izany ianao, hoy ny olona iray. Tsy nihomehy va ny olona?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Tamin&#39;izany dia nilaza tantara hafa tamiko izy. Ny mponina ao amin&#39;ny nosy Rokovoko, dia toa, amin&#39;ny fanasam-panambadiany, dia mamoaka ny rano mameroveron&#39;ny voaniho tanora amin&#39;ny laisoa lehibe misy loko miloko toy ny tavoara; ary io punchbowl io no mandrafitra ny haingo lehibe afovoany amin&#39;ny tsihy voarandrana izay anaovana ny fety. Ankehitriny dia nisy sambo mpivarotra lehibe iray tonga tao Rokovoko indray mandeha, ary ny komandin&#39;izy io — raha jerena ny zava-drehetra, lehilahy iray tena mahonon-tena, fara faharatsiny, ho an&#39;ny kapitenin-dranomasina — dia nasaina hanatrika ny fampakaram-badin&#39;ny anabavin&#39;i Queequeg, andriambavy tanora tsara tarehy, ity komandà ity. ny folo. Eny; rehefa tafavory tao amin&#39;ny trano bongo vita tamin&#39;ny ampakarina ny vahiny rehetra amin&#39;ny fampakaram-bady, dia niditra ity Kapiteny ity, ary nomena ny toerana misy ny voninahitra, dia nametraka ny tenany teo anoloan&#39;ny tavoara, ary teo anelanelan&#39;ny Mpisoronabe sy ny Mpanjaka, rain&#39;i Queequeg. Ny fahasoavana, hoy izy, - satria manana ny fahasoavany toa antsika ireo olona ireo - na dia nilaza tamiko aza i Queequeg fa tsy tahaka antsika, izay mijery ambany amin&#39;ny viliantsika, izy ireo, mifanohitra amin&#39;izany, maka tahaka ny ganagana, dia mibanjina ambony any amin&#39;ilay Mpanome lehibe. amin’ny fety rehetra—Ny fahasoavana, hoy aho, raha lazaina, dia ny Mpisoronabe no manokatra ny fanasana amin’ny alalan’ny lanonana hahatsiarovana ny nosy; izany hoe atsoboka ao anaty lovia ny rantsantanany nohamasinina sy voatokana alohan&#39;ny hivezivezen&#39;ny zava-pisotro misy fitahiana. Rehefa nahita ny tenany napetraka teo akaikin&#39;ny Pretra, ary nanamarika ny lanonana, ary nihevitra ny tenany ho kapitenin&#39;ny sambo iray - ho toy ny laharam-pahamehana kokoa noho ny Mpanjaka nosy fotsiny, indrindra fa ao amin&#39;ny tranon&#39;ny Mpanjaka - dia nanohy nanasa tanana tao anaty lovia kely ilay Kapiteny. ;—mihevitra aho fa ho vera lehibe amin&#39;ny rantsantanana. “Ankehitriny”, hoy i Queequeg, “inona no eritreretinao ankehitriny?—Tsy nihomehy ve ny firenentsika?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Farany, nandoa ny saran-dalana, ary azo antoka ny entana, dia nijanona teo ambony schooner izahay. Rehefa nampiakatra ny sambo izy, dia nitsofoka teny amin’ny reniranon’i Acushnet. Teo amin’ny lafiny iray, i New Bedford dia nitsangana teo amin’ny tora-pasika eny amin’ny arabe, ny hazony rakotra ranomandry dia namirapiratra avokoa tao anatin’ny rivotra madio sy mangatsiaka. Ny havoana lehibe sy ny tendrombohitra feno vaton-drano dia nivangongo teo amin&#39;ny seranan-tsambony, ary teo anilan&#39;ireo sambo trozona mirenireny eran-tany dia nangina ary voafatotra soa aman-tsara tamin&#39;ny farany; raha avy any amin&#39;ny hafa kosa dia nisy feon&#39;ny mpandrafitra sy ny mpanefy, miaraka amin&#39;ny tabataban&#39;ny afo sy ny forges mba handrendrika ny dity, izay samy milaza fa efa manomboka ny diabe vaovao; fa ny dia iray tena mampidi-doza sy lava dia nifarana, dia manomboka iray segondra monja; ary nifarana ny faharoa, manomboka ny fahatelo ihany, ary toy izany koa, mandrakizay sy ho mandrakizay. Izany no tsy misy farany, eny, ny tsy azo leferina amin&#39;ny ezaka rehetra eto an-tany.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nahazo ny rano misokatra kokoa, ny tsio-drivotra mampitony dia lasa vaovao; ny Moss kely nanipy ny fofony haingana teo amin&#39;ny tsipìkany, toy ny zana-boriky ny fisentony. Endrey ny namonoako an&#39;io rivotry ny Tartar io!—Endrey ny nandàvako an&#39;ilay tany fiolahana!—ilay lalambe iraisan&#39;ny besinimaro izay misy marika amin&#39;ny ombelahin-tongony sy ny kitrony; ary nampitodika ahy hidera ny halehiben’ ny ranomasina izay tsy hamela ny rakitsoratra.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tao amin&#39;io loharano foam io ihany, toa niara-nisotro sy nivezivezy tamiko i Queequeg. Nivonto ny vavorony maizina; nasehony ny nifiny mitsivalana sy maranitra. Nandeha, nanidina izahay; ary nahazo vokatra izahay, dia niankohoka tamin&#39;ny lefona ny Moka; Niondrika sy nitsoraka ny tsipìkany ho andevo teo anatrehan&#39;ny Sultan. Mitongilana izahay, mitsipitsipika izahay; ny ropeyarn rehetra maneno toy ny tariby; ireo andrin-tsambo avo roa miforitra toy ny tehina indiana amin&#39;ny tafio-drivotra an-tanety. Feno tanteraka ity seho mihozongozona ity izahay, raha nijoro teo akaikin’ny tsipìkan’ny tsipìka nilentika, ka nandritra ny fotoana kelikely dia tsy nahatsikaritra ny fijerijeren’ny mpandeha izay maneso, fivoriam-be toy ny lubber, izay talanjona fa tokony ho mpinamana tokoa ny olona roa; toy ny hoe ny fotsy hoditra dia mendri-kaja kokoa noho ny negro voalalotra fotsy. Saingy nisy boobies sy bumpkins sasany tao, izay, noho ny hatony mahery, dia tsy maintsy avy amin&#39;ny fo sy afovoan&#39;ny verdure rehetra. Tratran&#39;i Queequeg ny iray tamin&#39;ireo zana-kazo tanora ireo naka tahaka azy tao ambadiky ny lamosiny. Nihevitra aho fa tonga ny ora fandravana an&#39;i bumpkin. Nianjera ny harpony, dia nisambotra azy teo an-tsandriny ilay bibidia mahery fo, ary tamin&#39;ny haingo sy tanjaka saika mahagaga, dia nandefa azy niakatra ho any amin&#39;ny rivotra izy; avy eo dia nipitika kely ny vodiny teo afovoan&#39;ny somerset, ilay namany dia nipetraka niaraka tamin&#39;ny havokavoka nipoitra teo amin&#39;ny tongony, raha i Queequeg kosa, nitodika tany aminy, nampirehitra ny sodina tomahawk ary nanolotra izany tamiko ho sempotra.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Mikapoka! Capting!” nikiakiaka ilay bumpkin, nihazakazaka nanatona an&#39;io manamboninahitra io; “Mikapoka, misambotra, indro ny devoly.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Manahoana, 
      <i>
        tompoko
      </i>
       ,” hoy ilay Kapiteny, taolan-dranomasina manjavozavo, nanafika an’i Queequeg, “inona no tiana holazaina amin’izany? Tsy fantatrao ve fa mety ho nahafaty io toko io ianao?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Inona no lazainy?” hoy Queequeg, sady nitodika moramora tamiko.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Hoy izy,&quot; hoy aho, &quot;fa nanatona hamono an&#39;io lehilahy io teo ianao,&quot; nanondro ilay tandroka maitso mbola mangovitra.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Kill-e,” hoy i Queequeg niantsoantso, nanodinkodina ny tarehiny nisy tombokavatsa ho fanehoana fanamavoana tsy ara-tontolo iainana, “ah! izy bevy kely-e trondro-e; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg mamono trozona lehibe!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Jereo ianao”, hoy ilay Kapiteny, “Hovonoiko 
      <i>
        ianao
      </i>
       , ry mpihinan-kanina, raha mbola manandrana ny hafetsenao eto ambonin&#39;ny sambo ianao; koa tandremo ny masonao.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ary tamin&#39;izay indrindra no nitranga, ka tonga ny fotoana tokony hiheveran&#39;ny Kapiteny ny masony. Ny fihenjanana lehibe teo amin&#39;ny sambo lehibe dia nampisaraka ny toetr&#39;andro, ary ny boom lehibe dia nanidina nitety an-daniny, nanenika tanteraka ny ampahany tamin&#39;ny tokotany. Ilay mahantra izay notantanan&#39;i Queequeg tamin&#39;ny fomba mahery vaika dia nofaohin&#39;ny ranomasina; nikoropaka ny tanana rehetra; ary ny nanandrana naka an-keriny ny boom mba hijanonana azy, toa hadalana. Nanidina avy miankavanana miankavia izy io, ary miverina indray, saika amin&#39;ny fikitihana famantaranandro iray, ary isaky ny indray mipi-maso dia toa nipoitra ho vaky. Tsy nisy natao, ary toa tsy nisy azo natao; nirohotra nankany amin&#39;ny tsipìka ireo teo amin&#39;ny tokotanin-tsambo, ary nijoro nijery ny boom toy ny valanorano ambany an&#39;ny trozona sosotra. Tao anatin&#39;izany fahasahiranana izany, dia nianjera teo amin&#39;ny lohaliny i Queequeg, ary nandady teo ambanin&#39;ny lalan&#39;ny boom, nikapoka tady, nihazona ny tendrony iray teo amin&#39;ny fefy, ary avy eo nanipy ny ilany toy ny laso, nisambotra azy nanodidina ny boom. rehefa nikasika ny lohany izany, ary tamin&#39;ny fanenjehana manaraka, dia voafandrika toy izany ny tsipìka, ary tsy nisy na inona na inona. Ny schooner dia natsipy teo amin&#39;ny rivotra, ary raha mbola nanala ny sambo vodiny ny tanana, Queequeg, nendahana hatreo amin&#39;ny andilany, dia nitsoaka avy teo amin&#39;ny sisiny niaraka tamin&#39;ny arcs ela velona. Nandritra ny telo minitra na mihoatra dia hita nilomano toy ny alika izy, nanipy ny sandriny lava teo anoloany, ary nifandimby nampiseho ny sorony matanjaka tamin&#39;ny alalan&#39;ny foam mangatsiaka. Nijery ilay lehilahy lehibe sy be voninahitra aho, nefa tsy nahita olona hovonjena. Nidina ny tandroka maitso. Nitifitra ny tenany avy teo amin&#39;ny rano i Queequeg, dia nibanjina azy vetivety teo amin&#39;ny manodidina azy, ary toa nahita ny zava-misy, nilentika ary nanjavona. Minitra vitsy lasa izay, dia nitsangana indray izy, ny tanana iray mbola nipoitra, ary ny iray kosa nitaritarika endrika tsy misy aina. Vetivety dia naka azy ireo ny sambo. Naverina tamin&#39;ny laoniny ny bumpkin mahantra. Ny tanana rehetra nifidy an&#39;i Queequeg ho trompetra tsara; nitalaho famelan-keloka ny kapiteny. Nanomboka tamin&#39;izay fotoana izay dia nifikitra tamin&#39;i Queequeg toy ny barnacle aho; eny, mandra-pialan&#39;i Queequeg mahantra ny firobohany lava farany.
    </p>
    <p>
       Efa nisy ve ny tsy fahatsiarovan-tena toy izany? Toa tsy nieritreritra izy fa mendrika ny hahazo medaly avy amin&#39;ny Fikambanana Humane sy Magnanimous. Rano ihany no nangatahiny—rano madio—izay hamafa ny sira; Rehefa vita izany, dia nanao akanjo maina izy, nanazava ny sodinany, ary niankina tamin’ny fefy, ary nibanjina moramora ny manodidina azy, dia toa niteny anakampo hoe: “Tontolo iaraha-mitantana izany, amin’ny meridianina rehetra. Tsy maintsy manampy ireo Kristianina ireo izahay mpihinana sakafo.”

       TOKO 14. Nantucket.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Tsy nisy na inona na inona nitranga teo amin’ilay andalan-teny mendrika hotononina; noho izany, rehefa avy nihazakazaka tsara, dia tonga soa aman-tsara tao Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nantucket! Esory ny sari-tany ary jereo izany. Jereo ny tena zoron&#39;izao tontolo izao misy azy; ahoana ny fijoroany any, lavitra ny morontsiraka, manirery kokoa noho ny jiro Eddystone. Jereo izany — havoana sy kiho fasika; tora-pasika rehetra, tsy misy fiaviana. Betsaka kokoa ny fasika any noho izay azonao ampiasaina ao anatin&#39;ny roapolo taona ho solon&#39;ny taratasy famafana. Ny wights gamesome sasany dia hilaza aminao fa tsy maintsy mamboly ahi-dratsy any izy ireo, tsy maniry ho azy; fa manafatra tsilo any Canada izy ireo; fa tsy maintsy mandefa any an-dafin&#39;ny ranomasina izy ireo mba handroba mba hampitsaharana ny fahatapahan&#39;ny tavoahangin-tsolika; fa ny tapa-kazo ao Nantucket dia entina toy ny tapa-kazo tena izy any Roma; ny olona any dia mamboly saobakaka eo anoloan&#39;ny tranony, mba hidirana ao ambanin&#39;ny aloky ny fahavaratra; fa ny lelan&#39;ahitra iray dia manao oasis, lelany telo amin&#39;ny fandehanana isan&#39;andro ho tany lemaka; manao kiraro fasika, zavatra toy ny Laplander snow-kiraro; ka voahidy, voahidy, voahidy amin&#39;ny lafiny rehetra, voahodidina, ary natao ho nosy faran&#39;ny ranomasina, hany ka eo amin&#39;ny sezany sy ny latabany dia misy clams kely miraikitra indraindray, toy ny any an-damosin&#39;ny sokatra. Saingy ireo extravaganza ireo dia mampiseho fotsiny fa tsy Illinois i Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
       Jereo izao ny tantara nentim-paharazana mahatalanjona momba ny fomba nanorenan&#39;ny mena mena ity nosy ity. Dia toy izany ny angano. Tamin&#39;ny andro taloha dia nisy voromahery nitsambikina teo amin&#39;ny morontsirak&#39;i Nouvelle-Angleterre, ary nitondra Indiana zazakely iray teo amin&#39;ny tandrony. Nidradradradra mafy ireo ray aman-dreny nahita ny zanany nalaina an-keriny teny ambony rano midadasika. Nanapa-kevitra ny hanaraka izany lalana izany koa izy ireo. Niondrana an-tsambokely izy ireo, taorian’ny fandalovan’izy ireo nampidi-doza, dia nahita ilay nosy izy ireo, ary tao no nahitany vata ivoara tsy nisy na inona na inona, — taolan’ilay indianina kely mahantra.
    </p>
    <p>
       Inona àry no mahagaga fa ireo Nantucketers, teraka teny amoron-dranomasina, dia tokony handeha any an-dranomasina mba hivelomana! Tratra voalohany tao anaty fasika ny foza sy ny quohog; nitombo fahasahiana izy ireo, ka niroboka tamin&#39;ny harato hihazan&#39;ny makiraro; za-draharaha kokoa, nanosika an-tsambo izy ireo ary naka laoka; ary tamin&#39;ny farany, nandefa an-dranomasina an-tsambo lehibe teny an-dranomasina, nandinika ity tontolo feno rano ity; asio fehin-kibo tsy mitsaha-mihodina manodidina azy; nitsirika tao amin&#39;ny andilan&#39;i Behring; ary tamin’ny vanim-potoana rehetra sy ny ranomasimbe rehetra dia nanambara ady mandrakizay miaraka amin’ireo biby velona mahery indrindra izay tafavoaka velona tamin’ny safo-drano; tena goavambe sy be tendrombohitra! Io Himmalehan io, Mastodon-dranomasina masira, mitafy ny herin&#39;ny tsy fahatsiarovan-tena toy izany, hany ka ny fahatahorana azy dia tokony hatahorana kokoa noho ny fanafihana tsy misy tahotra sy ratsy indrindra nataony!
    </p>
    <p>
       Ary dia toy izany no nandresen&#39;ireo Nantucketers miboridana ireo, ireo mpitaingin-dranomasina ireo, nivoaka avy tao amin&#39;ny havoan&#39;ny vitsikany tao an-dranomasina, ary nandresy ny tontolo feno rano toa an&#39;i Aleksandra maro; Nizarazara tamin&#39;izy ireo ny ranomasimbe Atlantika, Pasifika ary Indianina, toy ny nataon&#39;ireo piraty telo tany Polonina. Avelao i Amerika hanampy an&#39;i Meksika ho any Texas, ary hanambatra an&#39;i Kiobà ao Kanada; aoka ny Anglisy hanafana an&#39;i India rehetra, ary hanantona ny faneva mirehitra amin&#39;ny masoandro; Ny roa ampahatelon&#39;io globe be terraque io dia an&#39;ny Nantucketer. Fa Azy ny ranomasina; azy io, toy ny an’ny Emperora ny fanjakana; ireo tantsambo hafa tsy manana afa-tsy zo handalo izany. Tetezana fanitarana ihany ny sambo mpivarotra; mitam-piadiana fa manda mitsingevana; eny fa na dia ny piraty sy ny olon-tsotra aza, na dia manaraka ny ranomasina toy ny mpanao làlambe aza izy, dia mandroba sambo hafa, izay sombin-tany hafa tahaka azy, nefa tsy mitady ny hivelomany amin&#39;ny lalina tsy misy farany. Ny Nantucketer, izy irery no mipetraka sy mikorontana eny an-dranomasina; Izy irery, amin’ny fiteny ara-baiboly, no midina any an-tsambo; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. 
      <i>
        There
      </i>
       is his home; 
      <i>
        there
      </i>
       lies his business, which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
