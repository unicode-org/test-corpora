       Spoubout-Innga cherkovdan qaytish, men u erda yolg&#39;iz kvequeGni topdim; U bir muncha vaqt marhamatdan oldin cherkovni tark etgan edi. U olov oldida skameykada, oyoqlari pechkasida o&#39;tiribdi va bir tomondan uning ismi yo&#39;qoldi. Uning yuziga va jakam bilan o&#39;ralgan holda, burniga ohista hushidan ketib, o&#39;zini majusiy yo&#39;lida qichqirdi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Endi u to&#39;xtab, suratga tushdi; Ko&#39;p o&#39;tmay, stolga borib, u erdagi katta kitobni oldi va uni tizzasiga qo&#39;yib, varaqlarini ataylab muntazam ravishda hisoblay boshladi; Har bir elliginchi sahifada, men bir lahza, uning atrofida tikilib, uning atrofida tikilib, uzoqdan chizilgan g&#39;ururli hushtak chalishiga yo&#39;l qo&#39;yaman. Keyin u yana ellikta ichida boshlanadi; Har safar, go&#39;yo ellikdan ko&#39;proq narsani hisoblay olmagandek, har safar birinchi raqamni aylanib chiqayotganga o&#39;xshab, bu ko&#39;p sonli ellikliklar juda hayajonlangan edi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Katta qiziqish bilan uni kuzatib o&#39;tirdim. Garchi u vahshiy bo&#39;lsa-da, yuzi jirkanch darajada xiralashgan bo&#39;lsa ham - hech bo&#39;lmaganda mening didimga ko&#39;ra - uning chehrasida hech qanday yoqimsiz narsa bor edi. Siz qalbni yashira olmaysiz. Uning barcha g&#39;ayrioddiy tatuirovkalari orqali men oddiy halol yurakning izlarini ko&#39;rganman deb o&#39;yladim; Va uning katta, chuqur ko&#39;zlarida, yonayotgan qora va jasur, ming shaytonga jur&#39;at etadigan ruh tokenlari tuyuldi. Bularning barchasidan tashqari butparastlik haqida bir to&#39;liq ta&#39;sir ko&#39;rsatdi, bu hatto uning bebaholigi ham umuman maymun emas edi. U hech qachon yig&#39;lamamagan va hech qachon kreditor bo&#39;lmagan odamga o&#39;xshardi. Uning boshi sochlarini qirib tashlaganligi sababli, peshonasi Ferer va engilroq yordam berar edi va buni amalga oshirish uchun uni yanada kengroq qaradi; Ammo uning boshi jahon jihatdan ajoyib edi. Bu juda kulgili ko&#39;rinishi mumkin, ammo u mashhur Vashingtonning boshi, uning mashhur büstüda ko&#39;ringanidek, menga eslatdi. Bu qoshiqlarning yuqorisidagi qoshlarning yuqorisidagi qoshiqlar bilan bir xil darajada duranglangan. Queekeg Jorj Vashington nashripalistik jihatdan rivojlandi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Men uni shu bilan yaqindan skanerdan o&#39;tkazayotganimda, u bo&#39;rondan voz kechish uchun u bo&#39;rondan chiqib, u hech qachon mening huzurimga quloq solmagan edi, hech qachon hech qachon bir qarashga o&#39;xshamagan; Ammo ajoyib kitob sahifalarni hisoblash bilan band bo&#39;lganlar. Bizni qanday qilib birinchi tunda uxlab yotganimizni va ertalab uyg&#39;onganimda meni tashlab yuborgan mehribon qo&#39;lni hisobga olgan holda, men bu juda g&#39;alati deb o&#39;yladim. Ammo vahshiylar g&#39;alati mavjudotlar; Ba&#39;zida siz ularni qanday qabul qilishni aniq bilmaysiz. Avvaliga ular haddan tashqari Ularning soddaligi soddaligi Sokrat donoligi ko&#39;rinadi. Men shuningdek, kvekeeg hech qachon umuman tan topmagan yoki juda oz, boshqa dengizchilarning mehmonxonada. U hech qanday yutuqqa erishmadi. Uning tanishlari doirasini kattalashtirishni xohlamagan ko&#39;rinadi. Bularning barchasi meni kuchli yakka sifatida hayratda qoldirdi; Ammo ikkinchi fikrlarda u erda deyarli ulug&#39;vor narsa bor edi. Bu erda uydan yigirma ming kilometr narida, ya&#39;ni, bu erda u erda bo&#39;lgani uchun, u erda bo&#39;lgani kabi, u Yupiterning sayyoradagi kabi g&#39;alati tuyulishi edi; Va u shunchaki o&#39;z xotirjamday tuyuldi. eng ishonchli suvni saqlash; o&#39;z sherigidan mamnun; har doim o&#39;ziga teng. Albatta, bu ajoyib falsafaning ta&#39;siri edi; Garchi u hech qachon bunday narsa borligini hech qachon eshitmagan edi. Ammo, ehtimol, haqiqiy faylasuflar bo&#39;lish uchun, biz o&#39;lmaganligimizni anglamasligimiz kerak. Tez orada bunday yoki bunday kishi faylasufga o&#39;zimni ado etaman, deb xulosa qilaman, bu nizom kampir singari, u &quot;hazmini sindirib tashladi&quot; deb hisoblayman.
    </p>
    <p>
       Men o&#39;sha erda men yolg&#39;iz xonada o&#39;tirgan edim. Olov kam yonib ketayotganda, bu engil bosqichda, birinchi intensivlik havoni isitgandan so&#39;ng, u faqat qaraydi; kechqurun soyalar va fantomlar vasiyatlarni yig&#39;ib, bizning jimjit, yolg&#39;iz ikkiga qarab turish; bo&#39;ron tantanali ravishda ko&#39;tariladi; Men g&#39;alati tuyg&#39;ularni his qila boshladim. Menda eriydi. Endi mening o&#39;g&#39;lim va g&#39;azablangan qo&#39;limni bo&#39;ri dunyosiga qarshi qo&#39;zg&#39;atilgan. Bu tinchlantiruvchi vahshiylik uni sotib olgan edi. U erda o&#39;tirdi, juda befarqlik tabiatni gapiradigan tabiatni gapiradi va u erda tsivilizatsiya qilingan ikkiyuzlamachilik va Bigliklar bechora. Yovvoyi edi; ko&#39;rish uchun diqqatga sazovor joylar; Ammo men o&#39;zimni sirli ravishda o&#39;ziga jalb qila boshladim. Va boshqa ko&#39;pchilikni hammaga qaytaradigan bir xil narsalar, ular meni shu erda tortgan magnitlar edilar. Men butparast do&#39;stimni sinab ko&#39;raman, deb o&#39;yladim, masihiylik mehr-oqibat, balki ichi bo&#39;sh iltifot ko&#39;rsatdi. Men uning yonida skameykani tortdim va do&#39;stona alomatlar va maslahatlar qilib, u bilan gaplashishga harakat qilaman. Avvaliga u bu yutuqlarni kam sezdi; Hozirgi kunda, men oxirgi kechasi kasalxonasiga murojaat qilganimda, men yana yotoqda bo&#39;lishimiz kerakmi, deb so&#39;rashga majbur qildi. Men unga ha aytdim; U mamnun bo&#39;lib ko&#39;rindi deb o&#39;ylagandim, ehtimol ozgina iltifot.
    </p>
    <p>
       Bas, Biz kitobni birga bo&#39;ldik va unga chop etish maqsadi va unda bo&#39;lgan bir nechta rasmlarning ma&#39;nosini tushuntirishga harakat qildik. Shunday qilib, men tez orada o&#39;z manfaatini berdim. Va bundan keyin biz ushbu mashhur shaharda ko&#39;rinadigan turli xil tashqi ko&#39;rinishlar haqida eng yaxshi narsalarga bordik. Ko&#39;p o&#39;tmay, men ijtimoiy tutunni taklif qildim; Va uning sumkasini va Towahkini ishlab chiqaradi, u menga ohista puffni taklif qildi. Va keyin biz uning yovvoyi quvurdan puffutlarni almashdik va uni oramizda muntazam ravishda olib bordik.
    </p>
    <p>
       Agar men yana menga butparast ko&#39;kragida muzdek befarqlik bo&#39;lsa, bu yoqimli, mayin tutuni, tez orada ediki va AQShning ayrimlarini qoldirdi. U men bilan men bilan tabiiy va boshqaruvchi menga juda borganday tuyuldi; Tutut tugagach, peshonamiz peshonasini pirib qo&#39;ydi va belni o&#39;rib qo&#39;ydi va bundan buyon turmush qurganimizni aytdim; Ma&#39;nosi, bizning mamlakatdagi jumlasida, biz Bosom do&#39;stlarimiz edik; Agar kerak bo&#39;lsa, u men uchun xursandchilik bilan o&#39;lishi mumkin edi. Birorta do&#39;stlik alangasi juda og&#39;ir bo&#39;lib tuyulgan bo&#39;lsa, juda ko&#39;p narsa yo&#39;q edi; Ammo bu oddiy vahshiylikda eski qoidalar qo&#39;llanilmaydi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kechki ovqat va boshqa ijtimoiy chat va tutundan keyin biz birga xonamizga bordik. U meni buzib tashlanganning oldiga qo&#39;ydi; Uning ulkan tamaki hamyonini olib, tamaki ostida o&#39;ralgan, bir oz o&#39;ttiz dollar kumushni tortdi; Keyin ularni stolga yoyib, ularni ikki teng qismga mexanik ravishda ajratib, mendan birortasini itarib yubordi va bu meniki ekanligini aytdi. Men qayta qurmoqchi edim; Ammo u meni ko&#39;p sonli cho&#39;ntagimga quyib, meni o&#39;chirdi. Men ularni qolishiga yo&#39;l qo&#39;ydim. Keyin u kechki namozni davom ettirdi, butini olib, qog&#39;ozdan olovni olib tashladi. Ba&#39;zi belgilar va alomatlar bilan men u menga qo&#39;shilish uchun meni tashvishga solgan deb o&#39;yladim; Ammo nima bo&#39;lishini yaxshi bilish, men bir lahzada meni taklif qilsa, men qo&#39;shilaman yoki boshqacha bo&#39;lardim.
    </p>
    <p>
       Men yaxshi masihiy edim; Tug&#39;ilgan Presveysiy cherkovining bag&#39;rida tug&#39;ilgan va tarbiyalangan. Qanday qilib men bu yovvoyi butparast bilan o&#39;tinka topinishda birlasha olaman? Ibodat nima o&#39;zi? Men hozir shunday deb o&#39;ylaysizmi, Ismoil, samoviy va erdagi g&#39;oyat ulug&#39;vor Xudoni va barcha qo&#39;shma qora yog&#39;ochni hasad qilishi mumkinmi? Imkonsiz! Ibodat nima o&#39;zi? Xudoni iroda qilish, 
      <i>
        bu
      </i>
       ibodatdir. Xudoning irodasi nima? - Xudoga boradigan narsalarim, bu Xudoning irodasi 
      <i>
        ekanligimni
      </i>
       o&#39;z ichiga oladigan narsalarimga nima qilishim kerak. Endi kvequeg - bu mening hamkasbim. Va bu kvekeg menga nima qilishini istayman? Nima uchun, mening elbinteryolyat shaklimda men bilan birlashing. Shunday qilib, men u bilan birga uni birlashtirishim kerak. ERGO, men butparastlikni aylantirishim kerak. Men talaşni yoqib yubordim; begunoh kichkina butni oshirishga yordam berdi; unga pechene kvekeeg bilan yonadi; uning oldida ikki yoki uch marta so&#39;ragan; burnini o&#39;pdi; Va bu amalga oshirildi, biz echinib, yotib, o&#39;z vijdonimiz va butun dunyo bilan tinchlik bilan yotamiz. Ammo biz ozgina suhbatsiz uxlamagan edik.
    </p>
    <p>
       Qanday bilmayman; Ammo do&#39;stlaringiz o&#39;rtasidagi maxfiy oshkoraliklar uchun to&#39;shak kabi joy yo&#39;q. Ular: &quot;Odam va xotin&quot;, ular bir-birlariga o&#39;zlarini ochdilar. Va ba&#39;zi eski juftliklar ko&#39;pincha ertalabgacha eski vaqtlar davomida yolg&#39;on gapirishadi va suhbatlashishdi. Shunday qilib, bizning qalbimizda mening qalbimizda, i va kveekeg-shinam, mehribon juftlik.

       Bizda yotoqda yotoqda, suhbatlashdi va qisqa vaqt ichida suhbatlashdi va hozirda kveekegni hozir va keyin orqamdan otib tashladik; Shunday qilib, biz butunlay xushmuomala va erkin va oson edi; Nihoyat, amrimiz tufayli, bizda biron bir kamchilik qoldig&#39;ida qoldi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ha, biz juda uyg&#39;onib ketdik; Bizning aholimdagi pozitsiyamiz charchatishni boshlagani uchun, kam va kichkinagina o&#39;tirganimizni ko&#39;rdik. Kiyimlar atrofimizda yaxshi, to&#39;rtta tizzamiz bilan bir-biriga suyanib, bir-biriga yopishib olishdi. Biz juda chiroyli va qizarib ketdik, shundan beri juda sovuq edi, chunki u eshiklardan juda sovuq edi; Darhaqiqat, xonada hech qanday olov yo&#39;qligini ko&#39;rib, yotoqxonadan tashqarida. Shunday bo&#39;lsa-da, men aytaman, chunki tana iliqligini, ba&#39;zi kichik qismingiz sovuq bo&#39;lishingiz kerak, chunki bu dunyoda bu shunchaki farq qilmaydi. Hech narsa o&#39;zi mavjud emas. Agar siz o&#39;zingizni qulay qilsangiz va shunchalik uzoq vaqt bo&#39;lsangiz, shunda siz boshqa har qanday qulay bo&#39;lishingizni aytolmaysiz. Ammo, agar kvequeg kabi, burnigingiz yoki boshingizning tojingiz biroz sovutib qolsa, nega siz umuman ongli ravishda iliq va noaniq ravishda iliqlikni his qilasiz. Shuning uchun uxlash kvartirasi hech qachon boylarning hashamatli noqulayliklaridan biri bo&#39;lgan olov bilan jihozlangan bo&#39;lishi kerak. Bunday mazalilikning balandligi uchun siz va tashqi havoning sovuqligi va sizning tashqi havoning sovuqligi. Keyin arktik kristalning yuragida iliq iliq uchqun kabi yotasiz.
    </p>
    <p>
       Biz bu erda bir muncha vaqt o&#39;tirgan edik, bir vaqtning o&#39;zida men ko&#39;zlarimni ochardim deb o&#39;ylagan edim. Kunduzi yoki kechasi va uxlab yotgan choyshablar orasida menda doimo ko&#39;zlarimni yumguncha, yotishning bo&#39;shlig&#39;ini ochish uchun har doim yonayotganini, yotog&#39;iga tushish uchun har doim yopiq bo&#39;lishim kerak. Chunki hech kim hech qachon Uning o&#39;ziga xosligini his qilolmaydi, faqat ko&#39;zlari yopiq bo&#39;ladi; Go&#39;yo qorong&#39;ilik haqiqatan ham bizning tanqidlarimizning to&#39;g&#39;ri elementi edi, ammo loy bizning loyimizga engilroq bo&#39;lishiga qaramay. Keyin ko&#39;zlarimni ochib, o&#39;zimning yoqimli va o&#39;z-o&#39;zidan qorong&#39;ilikni bulg&#39;angan o&#39;n ikki-kechasi bilan o&#39;ralgan va bir-kechasi tashqi zulmatga olib chiqing, men kechasi. Shuningdek, men hamma narsaga ishora qilmadimki, bu, ehtimol, yorug&#39;lik qilayotganimizni ko&#39;rish juda yaxshi edi. Bundan tashqari, u Towaxaqidan bir nechta jim pufaklarni his qilishni juda xohladi. Aytingki, men tunda to&#39;shakda uning chekishiga juda kuchli yomonlikni his qilgan bo&#39;lsam ham, shunga qaramay, bizning qattiq noto&#39;g&#39;ri qarashlarimiz ularni bir marta egilganda paydo bo&#39;ladi. Endi menda chekadigan narsamdan, hatto yotoqda, hatto yotoqda ham to&#39;shakda bo&#39;lgani uchun, menda chekadigan narsamdan yaxshiroq narsa yoqmadi. Men uy egasining sug&#39;urta siyosati uchun haddan tashqari tashvishlanmayman. Men real do&#39;sti bilan trubka va adyolni baham ko&#39;rishning konfidofiy ijobiyligi uchun tirik edim. Bizning erkamiz bilan suzish kurtkalarimiz bilan biz endi Tomoshakni biridan ikkinchisidan o&#39;tib, asta-sekin ko&#39;k chirichning alangasi bilan yoritilgan tutunni yoritib qo&#39;ydik.

    <p>
       Ushbu notekis sinovchi vahshiylik uzoq sahnalarga vahshiyona o&#39;rnidan turdi, men bilmayman, lekin u endi uning o&#39;z oroli haqida gapirdi; Va uning tarixini tinglashni xohlash, men undan borib, unga aytdim. U mamnuniyat bilan shikoyat qildi. Ammo men o&#39;sha paytda men uning so&#39;zlaridan ozgan, ammo keyinchalik oshkor qilishgan bo&#39;lsa, endi men o&#39;zimni beradigan oddiy skeletda isbotlashi mumkin bo&#39;lgan butun voqeani isbotlashimga imkon beradi.

       Quequeg G&#39;arbiy va janubdan uzoqda orolda bo&#39;lgan Rokovoko shahrida tug&#39;ilgan. Bu hech qanday xaritada emas; Haqiqiy joylar hech qachon emas.
    </p>
    <p>
       Yangi yirtqich yovvoyi yirtqich hayvonlari o&#39;tlarda yovvoyi bo&#39;lib, keyin u yashil ko&#39;chat bo&#39;lgan kabi, nibbli echkilar, go&#39;yo nibling echkilari; Shunga qaramay, kvekegning shuhratparast qalbida ham xristian olamining bir yoki ikkitasi bilan xristian olamini ko&#39;rishni juda xohlaydi. Uning otasi oliy va shoh edi. amakisi oliy ruhoniy; Onalar tomonida u zodagon jangchilarning xotinlari bo&#39;lgan xolalarni maqtadi. Uning tomirlarida juda yaxshi qon bor edi. Afsuski, men qo&#39;rqinchli moyillikdan qo&#39;rqamanki, u hech qanday qurolsiz yoshligida ovqatlanadi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Sagboy porti kemasi otasining ko&#39;rfazini ziyorat qildi va kvequeg nasroniy erlarga yo&#39;l qo&#39;ydi. Ammo kema dengizni to&#39;liq to&#39;ldirib, kostyumini rad etdi; Va butun otasining ta&#39;siri ustun emas. Ammo kvequeg nazokatni va&#39;da qildi. Uning kanoeda yolg&#39;iz o&#39;zi orolni olib ketganda, kemaning o&#39;tishi kerak bo&#39;lgan uzoq bo&#39;g&#39;ozga olib bordi. Bir tomonda marjon rifi edi; Boshqa bir pastda, suvga o&#39;sgan madgrove qalinlari bilan qoplangan. Kanoini yashirish, hanuzgacha suzib yurgan, bu ana shu yo&#39;laklari orasida, u o&#39;z aravalari dengiziga, qo&#39;lida pastga tushdi. Kema yonayotganda, u o&#39;chib ketdi. uning yonida; Oyog&#39;ini kesib tashlagan va kanoeda uni cho&#39;ktirgan. zanjirlarga ko&#39;tarildi; U erda butun paluba ustiga ko&#39;tarilib, halqani tortdi va uni qo&#39;yib yubormaslikka xalaqit bermadi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kapitan yo&#39;qolganida uni tashish bilan tahdid qildi; yalang&#39;och bilaklari ustida kesilgan. Queequeg shohning o&#39;g&#39;li edi va quiqueg bermadi. Uning umidsizligi bilan charchash va xristian olamiga tashrif buyurish istagi, kapitanning boshida, sardorlik qildi va o&#39;zini uyda yaratishi mumkinligini aytdi. Ammo bu juda yaxshi yosh vahshiy - bu dengizning bu dengiz shahzodasi hech qachon kapitanning kabinasini ko&#39;rmagan. Uni dengizchilar orasiga qo&#39;yib, undan xirillatdilar. Ammo podshoh Pyotr chet el shaharlarining kemasozlik zavodlarida mehnat qilishdan mamnun bo&#39;lgani kabi, Kvekeg ham o&#39;z o&#39;qimagan vatandoshlarini ma&#39;rifat qilish qudratiga ega bo&#39;lsa, hech qanday sharmandalikni mensimasdi. U, shuning uchun u menga aytib berdi - u xristianlar orasida, xalqini ulardan ko&#39;ra baxtli qilish uchun badiiy asarlar yaratgan. Va bundan ham ko&#39;proq, ularnikidan ham yaxshiroq. Ammo, Afsuski! Tez orada kaltaklangan kishi uni hatto masihiylar ham baxtsiz va yovuz bo&#39;lishiga amin bo&#39;lishdi. Otasining hamma odamlarining hammasi uchun juda ko&#39;proq. So&#39;nggi eski Sagborda nihoyat keldi; dengizchilar u erda nima qilishganini ko&#39;rib; Va keyin Nantketga borib, ular

    </p>
    <p>
       Shunday qilib, keksa butparast, u bu masihiylar orasida hali ham kiyimlarini kiyib, ularning piyodasi bilan gaplashishga harakat qildi. Shunday qilib, u haqida bir muncha vaqt uydan biroz vaqt ajratadi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Maslahatlar bilan men undan qaytib, orqasiga o&#39;girilib, tojga ega bo&#39;lishini so&#39;radim; Endi u Otasining o&#39;liklarini o&#39;sti va ketgan deb hisoblashi mumkinligi sababli, u oxirgi hisoblarda juda qarib, zaif bo&#39;lib qoldi. Yo&#39;q, u hali javob bermadi; Uning oldida u dahshatli nasroniylik yoki xristianlar bo&#39;lgan, ammo uning oldida o&#39;ttizta soxta butparast shohlar taxtini ko&#39;targani uchun yo&#39;q qilingan. U bilan va u orqali qaytib kelib, yana suvga cho&#39;mganini his qilar edi. Biroq, nodavlat uchun u suzishni taklif qildi va barcha to&#39;rt okeanida yovvoyi jo&#39;xori ekishni taklif qildi. Ular uning hiyla-nayranglarini va tikanli temir hozir hassasning leylida edi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Men undan kelajakdagi harakatlariga ta&#39;sir qilishi uchun uning zudlik bilan maqsadi nima ekanligini so&#39;radim. U yana eski kasbida dengizga borish uchun. Shundan so&#39;ng, men unga bu mening shaxsiy dizaynim ekanligini aytdim va unga Nantuketdan chiqib ketish niyatim bo&#39;lganligimni, sarguzasht kablerning eng istiqbolli port deb aytgan edim. U shu zahotiyoq bu orolga hamroh bo&#39;lishga qaror qildi, o&#39;sha orolga kevayotgan, xuddi shu qayiqni, xuddi shu qayiq, men bilan bir xil qayiq, qisman har bir yutuqlarimni baham ko&#39;rish uchun. Ikkala dunyoda ikkala qo&#39;llarim bilan ham jasorat bilan cho&#39;kib ketadi. Bularning barchasiga mamnuniyat bilan ishontirdim; Bundan tashqari, men hozir kvekeegga bo&#39;lgan muhabbatni his qildim, u tajribali harpoyoner edi va men kabi, men kabi, men kabi tanish bo&#39;lgan narsalardan juda foydali emas edi, lekin yaxshi tanish bo&#39;lganlar savdogar dengizchilarga ma&#39;lum bo&#39;lgan dengiz.
    </p>
    <p>
       Uning hikoyasi quvurining oxirgi o&#39;lishi bilan tugadi, quiqueg meni quchoqlab, bir-biridan o&#39;tib, bir-birimizga va yaqinda uxladik.

       13-BOB. RUVERVROSH.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Ertasi kuni dushanba kuni sartaroshga, blok uchun, blok uchun, men o&#39;z va o&#39;rtog&#39;imning to&#39;lovimni hal qildim; Ammo mening o&#39;rtog&#39;imning pullaridan foydalanish. Gulger egasi, shuningdek, men bilan birga bo&#39;lishgan to&#39;satdan do&#39;st bo&#39;lib, Piter Kofilning xo&#39;roz va buqalari uning uxlisining xo&#39;rozini va u bilan buxgalterlar, men hozir qayerdan qayerdan meni juda qo&#39;rqitdi bilan.
    </p>
    <p>
       Biz nogironlar aravachasini oldik va o&#39;z narsalarimizni, shu jumladan kambag&#39;al gilam-sumkamni va kvokuegning tuvali sumkam va yig&#39;im-mishmamga kirdik, &quot;MOSM&quot; ga tushdik. Biz odamlar bo&#39;ylab ketayotganimizda, tikilib qoldi. Qovuqada ham shunchalik ko&#39;p emas - ular ko&#39;chalarida, uning ko&#39;chalarida, men va men va meni shunday maxfiy ma&#39;noda ko&#39;rishga odatlanganlar. Ammo biz ularga quloq solmadik, burilishlar bo&#39;ylab, burilishlar va qip-kaqin bilan o&#39;rab, keyin arpon barbalarida zımbanani sozlash uchun to&#39;xtab qoldik. Men undan nega u bilan bunday dahshatli narsani olib, qirg&#39;oqdagi bunday dahshatli narsalarni olib yurganini so&#39;radim va hamma xiralik kemalari o&#39;zlarining shaffoflarini topa olmadilarmi? Bu, mohiyatiga ko&#39;ra, u menga etarlicha to&#39;g&#39;ri bo&#39;lgan bo&#39;lsa ham, u o&#39;zining norozi bo&#39;lganligi sababli, ko&#39;pchilik urug &#39;jangida va yuraklar bilan chuqur yaqinlikda harakat qilgani uchun. kitlar. Muxtasar qilib aytganda, dehqonlarning o&#39;tloqlariga o&#39;zlarining o&#39;roqlari bilan qurollangan ko&#39;plab o&#39;roqchilar va o&#39;roqchilar kabi - garchi ularni jihozlashga majbur bo&#39;lmasa ham, Kvek o&#39;zining shaxsiy sabablariga ko&#39;ra o&#39;zining garpunini afzal ko&#39;rardi.
    </p>
    <p>
       U menga qo&#39;lidan qo&#39;limdan siljigan holda, u menga hech qachon ko&#39;rgan birinchi g&#39;ildirak aravalari haqida kulgili hikoyani aytib berdi. Bu Sag portida edi. Uning kemasining egalari, unga qarzdor bo&#39;lganini, u erda kuchli ko&#39;kragini ko&#39;tarib yurgan uyiga olib ketishdi. Biror narsadan johil bo&#39;lib ko&#39;rinmasligi kerak, lekin haqiqatda u butunlay, to&#39;siq-kidükni boshqarish ko&#39;kragini o&#39;ziga tortadi; uni tez torting; Va keyin barrelni yelkalarini elkasiga ko&#39;taradi va ko&#39;tariladi. - Nega, - dedi i, - Quequeg, siz bundan ham yaxshiroq narsani bilgan bo&#39;lishi mumkin. Odamlar kulib yubormadimi?
    </p>
    <p>
       Shunda u menga boshqa bir voqeani aytib berdi. Rokovoko orolidagi odamlar, ularning to&#39;y marosimlarida yosh kokovali suvning mushukzor kabi katta kodabozga xushbo&#39;ylik suvini ifodalaydi; Va bu Pumchong doimo ziyofat bo&#39;lgan to&#39;qilgan to&#39;qlangan matning eng muhim markaziy bezakni hosil qiladi. Bir paytlar ma&#39;lum bir yirik savdogar kemasi Rokovoko va uning qo&#39;mondoni, hech bo&#39;lmaganda dengiz kapitani, hech bo&#39;lmaganda dengiz kapitani, hech bo&#39;lmaganda dengiz kapitali - bu komander shunchaki yosh malika to&#39;yga taklif qilindi o&#39;ntadan. Xo&#39;sh; Ushbu kapitanning barcha to&#39;y mehmonlari yig&#39;ilganda, bu kapitanning boshchiligida va oliy ruhoniy va qirolicha qirol, Qimko&#39;zning Otalariga qarshi kurashdi. Inoyat deganda, — bu odamlarning ham biz kabi inoyati bor — garchi Kyuik menga, bizdan farqli o‘laroq, bizdan farqli o‘laroq, bizdan farqli o‘laroq, ular, aksincha, o‘rdaklarni ko‘chirib, buyuk Beruvchiga qarab qo‘yishlarini aytdi. Men aytadigan barcha bayramlar-inoyatdan, oliy ruhoniy orolning azaliy marosimida ziyofatni ochadi; Ya&#39;ni, barmoqlarini barakali ichimlik davri aylanishidan oldin idishga botiradi. Nazariyning navbatdagi ruhoniyni, ayniqsa, sehrgarlikning sardori deb o&#39;ylaganini ko&#39;rib, bu shahar qirollik sardori bo&#39;lib, sarkarda Kapitan punkzorga qo&#39;llarini yuvishga qaror qildi ; Men buni juda katta barmoqli shisha uchun o&#39;ylayman. - Endi, - dedi kvekeg, - Siz hozir nima qilmoqchimisiz?
    </p>
    <p>
       Nihoyat, to&#39;langan va yuklar xavfsizligi, biz schuner bortida turdik. Yuk ko&#39;tarib yurib, u Acushnet daryosiga suzib ketdi. Bir tomonda, yangi beshburchaklar ko&#39;chalarda paydo bo&#39;lib, muz yopilgan daraxtlari aniq, sovuq havo bilan porloqlashmoqda. Katta tepaliklar va qutilar tog&#39;lari uning bezaklari va yonma-yon suzib kelayotgan kit kemiri yonma-yon suzib ketmoqda, nihoyat sukut saqlaydi; boshqalardan duradgorlar va kuperlarning ovozi eshitilardi, yong&#39;inlar va temirchilarning aralash shovqinlari maydonni eritish uchun yangi sayohatlar boshlanganidan dalolat beradi; Bu eng xavfli va uzoq davom etgan sayohat tugagan, faqat bir soniya boshlanadi; Ikkinchisining ikkinchi uchinchi qismi va hokazo, abadiy va uyachadan boshlanadi. Bu cheksizlik, ha, erdagi barcha harakatlarning intizomi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ko&#39;proq ochiq suv olish, bukilgan shabada yangi Kichkina mox kamonlaridan tez ko&#39;pikni mayda-chuydalarini egganligi sababli otib yubordi. Tartarning havosi men qanday qilib tortardim! - deb shuni aytaman! Meni hech qanday yozishga imkon beradigan dengizni mag&#39;obiylamasidan hayratda qoldirdi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Xuddi shu ko&#39;pikli favvora ostida kvequeg ichimda ichishgan va men bilan birga. Uning dusskiy burunlari alohida shishib ketishdi; U ariza bergan va nayzasini ko&#39;rsatdi. Ustida biz uchib ketdik; Va bizning xafagarchilikni xafa qilishimiz, Moss portlashga sajda qildi; O&#39;g&#39;illab o&#39;tib, kamonlarini sulton oldidagi qul sifatida sho&#39;ng&#39;idi. Yaqinda yonayotganda, biz dadil bo&#39;layapmiz; har bir ropirar karıncing sim kabi; Tornadodagi hindistonlik kanes kabi ikki uzun bo&#39;yli ustunlar. Shu sababli ushbu ko&#39;tarish sahnasiga to&#39;lganimizdek, biz bir muncha vaqt o&#39;tgach, ikkita iabbalar shunchalik ko&#39;p do&#39;st bo&#39;lishi kerakligini aytadigan yo&#39;lovchilar yig&#39;ilishini payqashimiz mumkin emasligini payqadik. Go&#39;yo oq odam oqlangan negrodan ko&#39;ra hurmatga sazovor bo&#39;lgandek. Ammo u erda kuchli yashillik bilan barcha gulxanlar va barcha aylanishlar markazi bo&#39;lgan ba&#39;zi bumbinlar va baqiriqlar bor edi. Queekeg bu yosh ko&#39;chatlaridan birini orqasiga qaragan holda ushladi. Bumpkinning azob-uqubat soati kelgan deb o&#39;yladim. Garpunni tashlab, qo&#39;pol yirtqich uni quchog&#39;iga oldi va deyarli mo&#39;&#39;jizaviy epchillik va kuch bilan uni tanadan baland havoga uchirdi; O&#39;tkazib yuborilgan o&#39;rtada uning qattiqqog&#39;ini bir oz urib, oyoqqa qo&#39;yib yubordi.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Kassa! Qo&#39;lga olish!” bu xastalikka yugurib, qichqiriqni qo&#39;zg&#39;atdi; &quot;Kaptığıd, bu shayton.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       - Salom, 
      <i>
        sen
      </i>
       ser, - qichqirdi kapitan, dengizning qovurig&#39;i, &quot;Siz bu haqda nima demoqchisiz? Siz buni o&#39;ldirganingizni bilmaysizmi?
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;U nima desa?&quot; - dedi kvekeg, u muloyimlik bilan menga o&#39;girilib.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;U:&quot; Sizlar bu odamning yonida, u erda &quot;bu odamning&quot; bu erda titradi &quot;, deb aytgan edim.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Qiling-E,&quot; - qichqirdi kınırın, uning zarbini burish bilan burang, &quot;. uni bevy small-e fish-e; Kvequeg yo&#39;q Kill-e juda kichik baliq-e; Kvekeg cil-e katta kit! &quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       - Sizlar bilan qarash, - deb baqirdi kapitan, &quot;men 
      <i>
        sizni
      </i>
       o&#39;ldiraman, agar siz bu erda bo&#39;lgan nayranglaringizni sinab ko&#39;ring. Ko&#39;zingizni aqldan ozdir.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ammo o&#39;sha paytda, kapitan o&#39;z ko&#39;zini yodda tutish vaqti keldi. Maydoningdagi mo&#39;rt shtamlari ob-havo varaqasini ikkiga qoldirdi va juda katta boom endi kemaning bir qismidan keyin butunlay supurib, yonma-yon uchib ketayotgan edi. Queekeg shu qadar kambag&#39;al odamning teri bilan to&#39;lib toshgan; barcha qo&#39;llar vahima ichida edi; Va buloqni ushlab turish uchun uni ushlab turish uchun aqldan ozganday tuyuldi. Bu o&#39;ngdan chapga va yana qaytib ketdi. Hech narsa qilinmadi va hech narsa qilinish qobiliyati yo&#39;q edi; Kuzgi daraxtlar kamon tomon yugurib, gumbazni mayda jag&#39;ning pastki jag&#39;lari kabi erga tikdilar. Ushbu qo&#39;riqchining o&#39;rtasida Queekeg tiz cho&#39;kib, arqonni qamrab olgan holda tashlandi, so&#39;ngra boshqalarini lasso kabi kesib tashladi, so&#39;ngra boshqalarni lasso kabi kesib tashladi Uning boshi ustidan va keyingi kreynda, beli pastga tushdi va hammasi xavfsiz edi. Shroner shamolga aylandi va qo&#39;llari qattiq qayiqni tozalab, kvekeg beliga egilib, sakrashning uzoq maskarligi bilan yonma-yon suzib ketdi. Uch daqiqa davomida u it kabi suzayotganini yoki uzun qo&#39;llarini uning oldida uzatib, burilish ko&#39;pikidan o&#39;tib, burilishlar bilan ko&#39;rishdi. Men bosh va ulug&#39;vor odamga qaradim, lekin hech kimni qutqarish uchun hech kimni ko&#39;rmadim. Yashil tushdi. O&#39;zini suvdan otib o&#39;ldirish, quinkag, endi uning atrofini bir zumda bir lahzaga qarab qo&#39;ydi va yaxshilab, g&#39;oyib bo&#39;ldi. Bir necha daqiqada yana ko&#39;tarilib, bir qo&#39;li baribir hayratda qoldirdi va boshqa tomoni bilan jonsiz shaklni sudrab bordi. Tez orada qayiq ularni ko&#39;tardi. Kambag&#39;al Bumpkin tiklandi. Barcha qo&#39;llar ovoz bergani yaxshi Trump; Kapitan kechirim so&#39;radi. O&#39;sha vaqtdan boshlab men to&#39;quv kabi qulamoqchiman; ha, bechora Queequeg so&#39;nggi uzoq sho&#39;ng&#39;iguncha.
    </p>
    <p>
       Hech qachon bunday hushidan ketganmi? U o&#39;zini insonparvarlik va saxovatli jamiyatlar medaliga loyiq deb o&#39;ylamaganga o&#39;xshaydi. U faqat suv toza suvini so&#39;radi, sho&#39;r suvni o&#39;chirish uchun biror narsani so&#39;radi; Bajarib, u quruq kiyim kiygan, quvurini yoritib, atrofidagi kishilarga muloyimlik bilan qarashdi va bu butun meridilardagi o&#39;zaro, aktsiyadorlik dunyosi deb aytayotganday tuyuldi. Biz bu masihiylarga yordam berishimiz kerak.

       Nantucket! Xaritangizni olib, unga qarang. Dunyoning haqiqiy burchagini egallaganiga qarang; Qanday qilib u qirg&#39;oqdan uzoqroq, Eddystone Pighthouse-ga qaraganda yolg&#39;iz qolish. Unga qarang - plitka va qum tirsaklari; barcha plyaj, fonsiz. U yerda yigirma yildan keyin qog‘oz o‘rnini bosadigan qumdan ham ko‘proq qum bor. Bir nechta o&#39;yinlarning ehtirosi sizga u erda begona o&#39;t o&#39;simlik ekish kerakligini aytadi, ular tabiiy ravishda o&#39;smaydi; ular Kanada qushqo&#39;nmasini import qilishlari; Ular dengizdan tashqariga, yog &#39;kaskida etishtirishni to&#39;xtatish uchun er ostidan yuborishlari kerak; Nantuketdagi yog&#39;och bo&#39;laklari Rimdagi haqiqiy xoch bitlari kabi olib boriladi; U erdagi bolalar uylari oldidagi madurstoollar, yozda soya ostiga olish; Bir pichoq vohani, bir kunlik piyoda uchburchakli uchta pichir qiladi; ular tez poyabzal kiyishadi, laplander qor poyafzallariga o&#39;xshaydi; Ular shu qadar yopiq, belbog&#39;li, har tomondan yopiq, o&#39;rab olingan va okean bo&#39;yida mutlaq orolga aylantirilganki, ularning stullari va stollariga ba&#39;zan dengiz toshbaqalarining orqa tomoniga yopishgan kichik mollyuskalar topiladi.

For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab
      </i>
       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
