       SURA YA 10. Rafiki wa Kifuani.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Kurudi kwa Spouter-Inn kutoka Chapel, nilimkuta Queequeg akiwa peke yake; baada ya kuondoka Chapel kabla ya baraka kwa muda. Alikuwa ameketi kwenye benchi mbele ya moto, na miguu yake juu ya makaa ya jiko, na katika mkono mmoja alikuwa ameshikilia karibu na uso wake kwamba kidogo negro sanamu yake; akichungulia kwa bidii usoni mwake, na kwa kisu cha jack-upole kikipeperusha pua yake, huku akijinyenyekeza kwa njia yake ya kishenzi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Lakini kwa kuwa sasa ameingiliwa, akaisimamisha sanamu; na hivi karibuni, akienda kwenye meza, akachukua kitabu kikubwa huko, na kukiweka kwenye paja lake alianza kuhesabu kurasa kwa utaratibu wa makusudi; katika kila ukurasa wa hamsini—nilipowaza—nikisimama kwa muda, nikitazama wazi karibu naye, na kutoa matamshi kwa mluzi wa mshangao wa muda mrefu. Kisha angeanza tena saa hamsini zinazofuata; Wanajidai kuanza katika namba moja kila wakati, kana kwamba hakuweza kuhesabu zaidi ya hamsini, na ni kwa vile idadi kubwa ya hamsini kuwa kupatikana pamoja, kwamba mshangao wake katika wingi wa kurasa alikuwa msisimko.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kwa hamu kubwa nilikaa nikimtazama. Savage ingawa alikuwa, na hideously umeharibiwa juu ya uso-angalau kwa ladha yangu-uso wake bado alikuwa na kitu ndani yake ambayo ilikuwa kwa njia yoyote haikubaliki. Huwezi kuficha roho. Kupitia tatoo zake zote zisizo za kidunia, nilifikiri niliona athari za moyo rahisi wa uaminifu; na katika macho yake makubwa, yenye kina kirefu, nyeusi na kijasiri, zilionekana ishara za roho ambayo ingethubutu pepo elfu moja. Na zaidi ya hayo yote, kulikuwa na sifa fulani ya juu juu ya Mpagani, ambayo hata uasherati wake haungeweza kabisa kulemaza. Alionekana kama mtu ambaye hajawahi kukunjamana na hajawahi kuwa na mkopeshaji. Kama ilikuwa, pia, kwamba kichwa chake kuwa kunyolewa, paji la uso wake inayotolewa nje katika unafuu huru na angavu, na inaonekana kujitanua zaidi kuliko ingekuwa vinginevyo, hii mimi si venture kuamua; lakini hakika ilikuwa kichwa chake kilikuwa kizuri sana. Inaweza kuonekana kuwa ya ujinga, lakini ilinikumbusha kichwa cha Jenerali Washington, kama inavyoonekana kwenye mabasi yake maarufu. Ilikuwa na mteremko ule ule mrefu wa kurudi nyuma kutoka juu wa paji la uso, ambao vile vile ulikuwa unajitokeza sana, kama matangazo mawili marefu yenye miti minene juu. Queequeg alikuwa George Washington aliendelezwa kwa ulaji nyama.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nilipokuwa hivyo kwa karibu skanning yake, nusu-kujifanya wakati huo huo kuwa kuangalia nje katika dhoruba kutoka casement, kamwe alizingatia uwepo wangu, kamwe taabu mwenyewe kwa kiasi kama mtazamo mmoja; lakini alionekana akijishughulisha kabisa na kuhesabu kurasa za kitabu hicho cha ajabu. Kuzingatia jinsi sociably tulikuwa kulala pamoja usiku uliopita, na hasa kwa kuzingatia mkono upendo nilipata kutupwa juu yangu juu ya kuamka asubuhi, nilifikiri kutojali yake ya ajabu sana. Lakini washenzi ni viumbe wa ajabu; wakati fulani hujui jinsi ya kuzichukua. Mara ya kwanza wao ni overawing; kujikusanya kwao kwa utulivu wa usahili inaonekana kuwa hekima ya Kisokrasi. Nilikuwa nimeona pia kwamba Queequeg hakuwahi kujumuika hata kidogo, au lakini kidogo sana, na mabaharia wengine katika nyumba ya wageni. Hakufanya maendeleo yoyote; alionekana kutokuwa na hamu ya kupanua mzunguko wa marafiki zake. Haya yote yalinipata kama umoja mkuu; lakini, juu ya mawazo ya pili, kulikuwa na kitu karibu tukufu ndani yake. Hapa palikuwa na mtu kama maili elfu ishirini kutoka nyumbani, kwa njia ya Cape Horn, ambayo ni-ambayo ilikuwa njia pekee angeweza kufika huko-kutupwa kati ya watu kama ajabu kwake kana kwamba alikuwa katika sayari Jupiter; na bado alionekana kabisa katika urahisi wake; kuhifadhi utulivu wa hali ya juu; kuridhika na ushirika wake mwenyewe; daima sawa na yeye mwenyewe. Hakika huu ulikuwa mguso wa falsafa nzuri; ingawa bila shaka hakuwahi kusikia kuna kitu kama hicho. Lakini, pengine, kuwa wanafalsafa wa kweli, sisi wanadamu hatupaswi kuwa na ufahamu wa kuishi hivyo au kujitahidi sana. Mara tu ninaposikia kwamba mtu kama huyo au kama huyo anajitolea kwa mwanafalsafa, ninahitimisha kwamba, kama mwanamke mzee mwenye dyspeptic, lazima &quot;amevunja digestion yake.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Nikiwa nimekaa pale kwenye kile chumba ambacho sasa ni cha upweke; moto unaowaka chini, katika hatua hiyo kali wakati, baada ya nguvu yake ya kwanza imewasha hewa, basi inang&#39;aa tu kutazamwa; vivuli jioni na Phantoms kukusanya pande zote casements, na peering katika juu yetu kimya, faragha wawili; dhoruba inayovuma bila mawimbi makubwa; Nilianza kuwa na busara ya hisia za ajabu. Nilihisi kuyeyuka ndani yangu. Hakuna tena moyo wangu uliogawanyika na mkono wa kichaa uligeuzwa dhidi ya ulimwengu wa mbwa mwitu. Mshenzi huyu mwenye kutuliza alikuwa ameikomboa. Hapo akaketi, kutojali yake sana kuzungumza asili ambayo kuna lurked hakuna unafiki kistaarabu na udanganyifu bland. Pori alikuwa; kuona sana vituko vya kuona; bado nilianza kujisikia kuvutwa kwake kwa njia ya ajabu. Na mambo yale yale ambayo yangezuia wengine wengi, ndio sumaku ambazo zilinivuta. Nitajaribu rafiki mpagani, nilifikiri, kwa kuwa wema wa Kikristo umethibitisha lakini adabu tupu. Nilisogeza benchi langu karibu naye, na nikafanya ishara na vidokezo vya urafiki, nikijitahidi niwezavyo kuzungumza naye wakati huo huo. Mara ya kwanza aliona kidogo maendeleo haya; lakini sasa, juu yangu akimaanisha ukarimu wake wa mwisho usiku, yeye alifanya nje kuuliza mimi kama tulikuwa tena kuwa bedfellows. Nikamwambia ndiyo; ambapo nilidhani anaonekana kufurahishwa, labda alipongeza kidogo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kisha tukakigeuza kitabu hicho pamoja, nami nikajitahidi kumweleza kusudi la kuchapa, na maana ya picha chache zilizokuwa humo. Hivyo mimi hivi karibuni kushiriki maslahi yake; na kutokana na hilo tukaenda kupiga porojo bora tulivyoweza kuhusu vituko mbalimbali vya nje vinavyoweza kuonekana katika mji huu maarufu. Hivi karibuni nilipendekeza moshi wa kijamii; na, akitoa pochi yake na tomahawk, alinipa pumzi kimya kimya. Na kisha tukaketi tukibadilishana pumzi kutoka kwa bomba la mwituni, na kuliweka likipita kati yetu mara kwa mara.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ikiwa bado kulikuwa na barafu yoyote ya kutojali kwangu kwenye matiti ya Wapagani, moshi huu wa kupendeza, wa kijinga tuliokuwa nao, uliufuta upesi, na kutuacha marafiki. Alionekana kunichukulia kikawaida na bila kupingwa kama mimi kwake; na moshi wetu ulipokwisha, alikandamiza paji la uso wake dhidi ya yangu, akanikumbatia kiunoni, na kusema kwamba tangu sasa tumeoana; maana yake, katika msemo wa nchi yake, kwamba tulikuwa marafiki wa karibu; angefurahi kufa kwa ajili yangu, ikiwa ni lazima. Katika mwananchi, moto huu wa ghafla wa urafiki ungeonekana kuwa ni wa mapema sana, jambo la kutotumainiwa sana; lakini katika ushenzi huu rahisi sheria hizo za zamani hazingetumika.
    </p>
    <p>
       Baada ya chakula cha jioni, na mazungumzo mengine ya kijamii na moshi, tulienda kwenye chumba chetu pamoja. Akanifanyia zawadi katika kichwa chake kilichotiwa dawa; alichukua mkoba wake mkubwa wa tumbaku, na kupapasa chini ya tumbaku, akatoa baadhi ya dola thelathini katika fedha; kisha kuzitandaza juu ya meza, na kuzigawanya kimawazo katika sehemu mbili zilizo sawa, nikasukuma moja kati yao kuelekea kwangu, na kusema ni yangu. Nilikuwa naenda kukataa; lakini alininyamazisha kwa kuzimimina kwenye mifuko ya suruali yangu. Nikawaacha wakae. Kisha akaendelea na maombi yake ya jioni, akatoa sanamu yake, na kuondoa ubao wa karatasi. Kwa ishara na dalili fulani, nilifikiri alionekana kuwa na wasiwasi ili nijiunge naye; lakini nikijua ni nini kingefuata, nilitafakari kwa muda kama kama angenialika, ningetii au vinginevyo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nilikuwa Mkristo mzuri; kuzaliwa na kukulia katika kifua cha Kanisa la Presbyterian lisiloweza kukosea. Ningewezaje basi kuungana na muabudu sanamu huyu mwitu katika kuabudu kipande chake cha mti? Lakini ibada ni nini? Nilifikiri I. Je, unadhani sasa, Ishmaeli, kwamba Mungu mkuu wa mbingu na dunia—wapagani na wote wakiwemo—anaweza kuwa na wivu kwa kipande kidogo cha mti mweusi? Haiwezekani! Lakini ibada ni nini?—kufanya mapenzi ya Mungu— 
      <i>
        hiyo
      </i>
       ndiyo ibada. Na mapenzi ya Mungu ni nini?—kuwatendea wanadamu wenzangu yale ambayo ningetaka wanadamu wenzangu wanifanyie— 
      <i>
        hayo
      </i>
       ndiyo mapenzi ya Mungu. Sasa, Queequeg ni mtu mwenzangu. Na ninatamani kwamba Queequeg hii angenifanyia nini? Mbona, ungana nami katika aina yangu maalum ya ibada ya Kipresbiteri. Kwa hiyo, ni lazima basi niungane naye katika wake; kwa hivyo, lazima nigeuke mwabudu sanamu. Kwa hiyo nikawasha shavings; ilisaidia kuunga mkono sanamu ndogo isiyo na hatia; akampa biskuti iliyochomwa na Queequeg; Salamu mbele yake mara mbili au tatu; akambusu pua yake; na hilo lilifanyika, tulivua nguo na kwenda kulala, tukiwa na amani na dhamiri zetu wenyewe na ulimwengu wote. Lakini hatukulala bila mazungumzo kidogo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Jinsi ilivyo sijui; lakini hakuna mahali kama kitanda cha ufichuzi wa siri kati ya marafiki. Mwanamume na mke, wanasema, hapo hufunguana sehemu ya chini kabisa ya nafsi zao; na baadhi ya wanandoa wazee mara nyingi hudanganya na kupiga gumzo nyakati za zamani hadi karibu asubuhi. Kwa hivyo, basi, katika fungate ya mioyo yetu, tulilala mimi na Queequeg - jozi ya kupendeza, yenye upendo.

    <p>
       Tulikuwa tumelala hivyo kitandani, tukizungumza na kulala kwa muda mfupi, na Queequeg sasa na kisha kwa upendo akirusha miguu yake yenye tatoo ya hudhurungi juu ya yangu, na kisha kuirudisha nyuma; hivyo kabisa sociable na bure na rahisi tulikuwa; wakati, hatimaye, kwa sababu ya confabulations yetu, kile nappishness kidogo alibaki ndani yetu kabisa akaondoka, na sisi kujisikia kama kupata tena, ingawa siku ya mapumziko ilikuwa bado baadhi ya njia chini ya siku zijazo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ndiyo, tukawa macho sana; kiasi kwamba nafasi yetu ya kukaa ilianza kuchosha, na kidogo kidogo tukajikuta tumekaa; nguo zilizotundikwa vizuri, zikiegemea ubao wa kichwa na magoti yetu manne yakiwa yameunganishwa kwa karibu, na pua zetu mbili zikiwa zimeinama juu yake, kana kwamba vifuko vyetu vya magoti vilikuwa vya kuwekea joto. Tulijisikia vizuri sana na tulivu, zaidi kwa vile kulikuwa na ubaridi sana nje ya nyumba; kweli nje ya nguo za kitandani pia, kuona kwamba hakuna moto katika chumba. Ninasema hivyo zaidi, kwa sababu ili kufurahia joto la mwili, sehemu fulani ndogo ya wewe lazima iwe baridi, kwa maana hakuna ubora katika ulimwengu huu ambao sivyo ulivyo kinyume chake. Hakuna kitu kipo chenyewe. Ikiwa unajipendekeza kwamba umestarehe kabisa, na umekuwa kwa muda mrefu, basi huwezi kusema kuwa umestarehe tena. Lakini ikiwa, kama Queequeg na mimi kitandani, ncha ya pua yako au taji ya kichwa chako imepozwa kidogo, kwa nini basi, kwa kweli, katika ufahamu wa jumla unahisi joto la kupendeza na bila kosa. Kwa sababu hii nyumba ya kulala haipaswi kamwe kuwa na moto, ambayo ni moja ya usumbufu wa anasa wa matajiri. Kwa maana urefu wa aina hii ya ladha ni kutokuwa na chochote isipokuwa blanketi kati yako na urembo wako na baridi ya hewa ya nje. Kisha hapo unalala kama cheche moja ya joto kwenye moyo wa fuwele ya aktiki.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tulikuwa tumekaa kwa namna hii ya kujikunyata kwa muda, wakati wote mara moja nilifikiri ningefungua macho yangu; kwa maana wakati kati ya shuka, iwe ni mchana au usiku, na iwe nimelala au macho, nina njia ya kuweka macho yangu daima, ili zaidi kuzingatia unyogovu wa kuwa kitandani. Kwa sababu hakuna mtu anayeweza kuhisi utambulisho wake mwenyewe sawa isipokuwa macho yake yamefumbwa; kana kwamba giza ndio kiumbe kinachofaa cha asili yetu, ingawa nuru inaweza kuwa rahisi zaidi kwa sehemu yetu ya udongo. Nilipofumbua macho yangu wakati huo, na kutoka katika giza langu la kupendeza na la kujiumba ndani ya utusitusi wa nje wa utusitusi usio na mwanga wa saa kumi na mbili za usiku, nilipata chuki isiyokubalika. Wala mimi wakati wote kupinga dokezo kutoka Queequeg kwamba labda ni bora kwa mgomo mwanga, kuona kwamba sisi walikuwa hivyo macho; na zaidi ya hayo alihisi hamu kubwa ya kuwa na pumzi chache za utulivu kutoka kwa Tomahawk yake. Iseme kwamba, ingawa nilihisi chuki kali sana kwa uvutaji sigara wake kitandani usiku uliopita, lakini tazama jinsi ubaguzi wetu mkali unavyokua wakati upendo unapokuja kuinama. Kwa sasa mimi walipenda kitu bora kuliko kuwa na Queequeg sigara na mimi, hata katika kitanda, kwa sababu alionekana kuwa kamili ya vile serene furaha ya nyumbani wakati huo. Sikuhisi tena wasiwasi isivyofaa kuhusu sera ya mwenye nyumba ya bima. Nilikuwa hai hadi nilipopata faraja ya siri ya kushiriki bomba na blanketi na rafiki wa kweli. Jaketi zetu zenye shaggy zikiwa zimechorwa kwenye mabega yetu, sasa tulipitisha Tomahawk kutoka moja hadi nyingine, mpaka polepole kukakua juu yetu kipima moshi chenye rangi ya buluu, kilichomulikwa na mwali wa taa hiyo mpya.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kama ni kwamba tester hii isiyo na maana ilimpeleka yule mshenzi kwenye matukio ya mbali, sijui, lakini sasa alizungumza kuhusu kisiwa chake cha asili; na kwa shauku ya kusikia historia yake, nikamsihi aendelee na kuisimulia. Alitii kwa furaha. Ingawa wakati huo sikuelewa maneno yake machache, lakini ufichuzi uliofuata, nilipokuwa nimefahamu zaidi maneno yake yaliyovunjika, sasa yaniwezesha kuwasilisha hadithi nzima kama vile inaweza kuthibitisha katika mifupa tu ninayotoa.

       SURA YA 12. Wasifu.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Queequeg alikuwa mzaliwa wa Rokovoko, kisiwa kilicho mbali sana na Magharibi na Kusini. Haiko chini katika ramani yoyote; maeneo ya kweli kamwe hayapo.
    </p>
    <p>
       Wakati mpya-hatched savage mbio mwitu kuhusu misitu yake ya asili katika mshikamano nyasi, ikifuatiwa na mbuzi nibbling, kama kwamba walikuwa mti mchanga kijani; hata wakati huo, katika nafsi ya Queequeg yenye tamaa, ilijificha tamaa kubwa ya kuona kitu zaidi ya Jumuiya ya Wakristo kuliko mvutaji wa nyangumi au mbili. Baba yake alikuwa Chifu Mkuu, Mfalme; mjomba wake Kuhani Mkuu; na kwa upande wa kinamama alijivunia shangazi ambao walikuwa ni wake wa wapiganaji wasioweza kushindwa. Kulikuwa na damu bora katika mishipa yake-mambo ya kifalme; ingawa cha kusikitisha vitiated, mimi hofu, kwa propensity cannibal yeye kulishwa katika ujana wake untutored.
    </p>
    <p>
       Meli ya Sag Harbour ilitembelea ghuba ya baba yake, na Queequeg akatafuta njia ya kwenda kwenye nchi za Kikristo. Lakini ile meli, ikiwa na wanamaji kamili, ikakataa suti yake; na si ushawishi wote wa Mfalme baba yake ungeweza kushinda. Lakini Queequeg aliapa kiapo. Akiwa peke yake ndani ya mtumbwi wake, alipiga kasia hadi kwenye njia ya mbali, ambayo alijua lazima meli ipite itakapoondoka kwenye kisiwa hicho. Upande mmoja kulikuwa na mwamba wa matumbawe; kwa upande mwingine ulimi mdogo wa nchi kavu, uliofunikwa na vichaka vya mikoko vilivyoota majini. Mafichoni mtumbwi wake, bado kuelea, kati ya vichaka haya, na mbele yake seaward, akaketi katika nyuma ya nyuma, paddle chini katika mkono; na merikebu ilipokuwa ikipita, aliruka kama mweko; alipata upande wake; na dash moja nyuma ya mguu wake capsized na kuzama mtumbwi wake; akapanda minyororo; na kutupa mwenyewe kwa urefu kamili juu ya sitaha, grappled pete-bolt huko, na kuapa si basi ni kwenda, ingawa hacked katika vipande vipande.
    </p>
    <p>
       Bila mafanikio nahodha akatishia kumtupa baharini; suspended cutlass juu ya mikono yake uchi; Queequeg alikuwa mwana wa Mfalme, na Queequeg hakukubali. Akiwa amepigwa na ujasiri wake wa kukata tamaa, na tamaa yake mbaya ya kutembelea Jumuiya ya Wakristo, nahodha huyo hatimaye akalegea, na kumwambia huenda akarudi nyumbani. Lakini kijana huyu mshenzi mzuri—Mfalme wa Wales wa baharini, hakuwahi kuona kibanda cha Kapteni. Wakamweka chini kati ya mabaharia, wakamfanya mtu wa nyangumi. Lakini kama vile Mtawala Petro alivyotosheka kuhangaika katika viwanja vya meli vya majiji ya kigeni, Queequeg hakudharau lolote lililoonekana kuwa dharau, ikiwa kwa kufanya hivyo angepata uwezo wa kuwaelimisha watu wa nchi yake ambao hawakuwa na elimu kwa furaha. Kwa maana hapo chini—hivyo aliniambia—alichochewa na hamu kubwa ya kujifunza miongoni mwa Wakristo, sanaa ambayo kwayo ili kuwafanya watu wake waendelee kuwa na furaha kuliko walivyokuwa; na zaidi ya hayo, bado ni bora kuliko walivyokuwa. Lakini, ole! mazoea ya nyangumi upesi yalimsadikisha kwamba hata Wakristo wangeweza kuwa wenye huzuni na waovu; zaidi sana, kuliko makafiri wote wa baba yake. Ilifika mwisho katika Bandari ya Sag ya zamani; na kuona walichofanya mabaharia huko; na kisha kwenda Nantucket, na kuona jinsi walitumia mishahara yao katika 
      <i>
        mahali
      </i>
       pia, maskini Queequeg akaitoa kwa waliopotea. Alidhani yeye, ni ulimwengu mwovu katika meridians zote; Nitakufa mpagani.
    </p>
    <p>
       Na kwa hivyo mzee mwabudu sanamu moyoni, bado aliishi kati ya Wakristo hawa, alivaa nguo zao, na kujaribu kuzungumza upuuzi wao. Kwa hivyo njia queer juu yake, ingawa sasa baadhi ya muda kutoka nyumbani.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kwa vidokezo, nilimuuliza ikiwa hakupendekeza kurudi, na kutawazwa; kwa kuwa sasa angeweza kufikiria baba yake amekufa na amekwenda, yeye ni mzee sana na dhaifu katika hesabu za mwisho. Akajibu hapana, bado; na akaongeza kwamba alikuwa Ukristo wa kuogofya, au tuseme Wakristo, hawakumstahili kwa ajili ya kukwea kiti cha enzi safi na kisichotiwa unajisi cha Wafalme thelathini wa kipagani mbele yake. Lakini baada ya muda, alisema, angerudi,—mara tu alipohisi amebatizwa tena. Kwa mara ya kwanza, hata hivyo, alipendekeza kuzunguka, na kupanda oats yake ya mwitu katika bahari zote nne. Walikuwa wamefanya harpooneer yake, na kwamba chuma barbed alikuwa badala ya fimbo ya sasa.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nilimuuliza nini kinaweza kuwa kusudi lake la haraka, kugusa harakati zake za baadaye. Akajibu, kwenda baharini tena, katika wito wake wa zamani. Juu ya hili, mimi alimwambia kwamba whaling alikuwa mpango wangu mwenyewe, na taarifa yake ya nia yangu ya meli nje ya Nantucket, kama kuwa bandari wengi kuahidi kwa whaleman adventurous panda kutoka. Mara moja aliamua kuandamana nami kwenye kisiwa hicho, kwa meli ndani ya chombo kile kile, kuingia katika lindo lile lile, mashua ile ile, fujo sawa na mimi, kwa ufupi kushiriki kila hap yangu; kwa mikono yangu miwili katika yake, kwa ujasiri kuzamisha katika Potluck ya walimwengu wote wawili. Kwa haya yote nilikubali kwa furaha; kwa maana zaidi ya mapenzi niliyokuwa nayo sasa kwa Queequeg, alikuwa mpiga harpooneer mwenye uzoefu, na kwa hivyo, hangeweza kushindwa kuwa na manufaa makubwa kwa mtu ambaye, kama mimi, hakujua kabisa siri za kuvua nyangumi, ingawa alifahamu vizuri baharini, kama inavyojulikana kwa mabaharia wa wafanyabiashara.
    </p>
    <p>
       Hadithi yake kumalizika kwa puff bomba yake ya mwisho kufa, Queequeg kuvutiwa yangu, taabu paji la uso wake dhidi yangu, na kupiga nje mwanga, sisi akavingirisha juu kutoka kwa kila mmoja, kwa njia hii na kwamba, na haraka sana walikuwa wamelala.

       SURA YA 13. Toroli.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Asubuhi iliyofuata, Jumatatu, baada ya kutupa kichwa kilichotiwa dawa kwa kinyozi, kwa ajili ya kuzuia, nililipa muswada wangu mwenyewe na wa rafiki yangu; kwa kutumia, hata hivyo, pesa za mwenzangu. Mwenye nyumba mwenye tabasamu, pamoja na wapangaji, walionekana kufurahishwa sana na urafiki wa ghafla ambao ulikuwa umeanza kati yangu na Queequeg—hasa jinsi hadithi za jogoo wa Peter Coffin na fahali juu yake hapo awali zilinitia wasiwasi sana kuhusu mtu yule ambaye sasa niliandamana naye. na.
    </p>
    <p>
       Sisi alikopa toroli, na kujiingiza mambo yetu, ikiwa ni pamoja na maskini yangu mwenyewe carpet-mfuko, na Queequeg canvas gunia na machela, mbali sisi akaenda chini ya &quot;Moss,&quot; kidogo Nantucket pakiti schooner mood katika wharf. Tulipokuwa tukitembea watu walitazama; si Queequeg sana - kwa maana walikuwa wamezoea kuona cannibals kama yeye katika mitaa yao, lakini katika kuona yeye na mimi juu ya masharti kama siri. Lakini sisi hawakuwa na wao si, kwenda pamoja wheeling barrow kwa zamu, na Queequeg sasa na kisha kuacha kurekebisha ala juu ya barbs yake chusa. Nilimuuliza kwa nini alibeba kitu kigumu kama hicho pamoja naye ufukweni, na ikiwa meli zote za kuvua nyangumi hazikupata vichungi vyao wenyewe. Kwa hili, kimsingi, alijibu, kwamba ingawa kile nilichodokeza kilikuwa cha kweli vya kutosha, lakini alikuwa na mapenzi mahususi kwa chusa yake mwenyewe, kwa sababu ilikuwa ya vitu vya uhakika, iliyojaribiwa vyema katika mapigano mengi ya kibinadamu, na ya karibu sana na mioyo. ya nyangumi. Kwa ufupi, kama wavunaji wengi wa bara na wakata nyasi, ambao huenda kwenye malisho ya wakulima wakiwa na sira zao wenyewe—ingawa hawakulazimika kuzitoa—hata hivyo, Queequeg, kwa sababu zake binafsi, alipendelea chusa yake mwenyewe.
    </p>
    <p>
       Akihamisha baroli kutoka mkononi mwangu hadi lake, aliniambia hadithi ya kuchekesha kuhusu toroli ya kwanza ambayo amewahi kuona. Ilikuwa katika Bandari ya Sag. Wamiliki wa meli yake, inaonekana, walikuwa wamemkopesha, ili kubeba kifua chake kizito hadi kwenye bweni lake. Sio kuonekana kuwa mjinga juu ya jambo hilo - ingawa kwa kweli alikuwa hivyo kabisa, kuhusu njia sahihi ya kusimamia barrow - Queequeg anaweka kifua chake juu yake; piga haraka; na kisha kubeba barrow na kuandamana juu ya bandari. &quot;Kwa nini,&quot; nilisema, &quot;Queequeg, unaweza kuwa umejua vizuri zaidi kuliko hiyo, mtu angefikiria. Je, watu hawakucheka?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Juu ya hili, aliniambia hadithi nyingine. Watu wa kisiwa chake cha Rokovoko, inaonekana, kwenye karamu zao za arusi hudhihirisha maji yenye harufu nzuri ya nazi changa kwenye kibuyu kikubwa chenye madoa kama bakuli; na bakuli hili la punch daima hutengeneza pambo kuu la kati kwenye mkeka uliosokotwa ambapo karamu hufanyika. Sasa meli fulani kubwa ya wafanyabiashara ilifika Rokovoko, na kamanda wake - kutoka kwa akaunti zote, bwana mwenye busara sana, angalau kwa nahodha wa baharini - kamanda huyu alialikwa kwenye karamu ya harusi ya dada Queequeg, binti wa kifalme mchanga ambaye amegeuka hivi karibuni. ya kumi. Vizuri; wakati wageni wote wa arusi walipokusanyika kwenye jumba la mianzi la bibi-arusi, Kapteni huyu anaingia ndani, na kupewa wadhifa wa heshima, alijiweka juu ya bakuli, na kati ya Kuhani Mkuu na ukuu wake Mfalme, baba ya Queequeg. Neema inasemwa, - kwa kuwa watu hao wana neema yao kama sisi - ingawa Queequeg aliniambia kuwa tofauti na sisi, ambao nyakati kama hizo hutazama chini kwenye sahani zetu, wao, kinyume chake, wakiiga bata, hutazama juu kwa Mpaji mkuu. ya karamu zote—Neema, nasema, ikisemwa, Kuhani Mkuu hufungua karamu kwa sherehe ya ukumbusho wa kisiwa; yaani, kuchovya vidole vyake vilivyowekwa wakfu na kuweka wakfu ndani ya bakuli kabla ya kinywaji kilichobarikiwa kuzunguka. Akijiona yuko karibu na Kuhani, na akizingatia sherehe, na kujiona mwenyewe - akiwa Nahodha wa meli - kama anayetanguliwa wazi juu ya Mfalme wa kisiwa tu, haswa katika nyumba ya Mfalme mwenyewe - Kapteni anaendelea kuosha mikono yake kwenye bakuli. ;-kuichukua nadhani kwa glasi kubwa ya kidole. “Sasa,” akasema Queequeg, “unafikiri nini sasa?—Je, watu wetu hawakucheka?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Hatimaye, njia ililipwa, na salama ya mizigo, tulisimama kwenye schooner. Ikipanda tanga, iliteleza chini ya mto Acushnet. Upande mmoja, New Bedford iliinuka katika matuta ya barabara, miti yao iliyofunikwa na barafu yote iking&#39;aa katika hewa safi na baridi. Milima mikubwa na milima ya mabeberu kwenye casks ilirundikwa juu ya nyangumi zake, na kando kando meli za nyangumi zinazozunguka-zunguka zilikaa kimya na zimewekwa salama mwishowe; wakati kutoka kwa wengine alikuja sauti ya maseremala na coopers, na blended kelele za moto na forges kuyeyusha lami, wote betokening kwamba cruises mpya walikuwa juu ya kuanza; kwamba safari moja ya hatari na ndefu ilimalizika, huanza sekunde moja tu; na ya pili iliisha, inaanza tu ya tatu, na kadhalika, milele na milele. Huo ndio kutokuwa na mwisho, ndio, kutovumilika kwa juhudi zote za kidunia.
    </p>
    <p>
       Baada ya kupata maji yaliyo wazi zaidi, upepo mkali ulivuma; Moss mdogo alitupa povu la haraka kutoka kwenye pinde zake, kama mwana-punda akipiga mkoromo wake. Jinsi nilivyoipulizia hewa hiyo ya Kitatari!—jinsi nilivyoidharau dunia ile ya pinduka!—barabara hiyo kuu ya kawaida iliyokuwa na alama za visigino na kwato za utumwa; na akanigeuza nistaajabie ukuu wa bahari ambao hautaruhusu kumbukumbu zozote.
    </p>
    <p>
       Katika chemchemi hiyo hiyo ya povu, Queequeg alionekana kunywa na kufurahi pamoja nami. Pua zake za dusky zilivimba; alionyesha meno yake yaliyofungwa na yaliyochongoka. Juu, juu ya sisi akaruka; na mavuno yetu yakapata, Moss ikasujudia ule mlipuko; alipiga pinde na kupiga pinde zake kama mtumwa mbele ya Sultani. Tukiegemea pembeni, tukaruka kando; kila uzi wa kamba ukitingisha kama waya; milingoti miwili mirefu inayoning&#39;inia kama mikongojo ya Kihindi kwenye vimbunga vya nchi kavu. Hivyo kamili ya eneo hili reeling walikuwa sisi, kama sisi alisimama kwa bowsprit porojo, kwamba kwa muda hatukuweza kuona macho kejeli ya abiria, mkutano lubber-kama, ambao walishangaa kwamba viumbe wenzake wawili wanapaswa kuwa hivyo companionable; kana kwamba mzungu alikuwa na heshima zaidi kuliko mtu mweusi aliyepakwa chokaa. Lakini kulikuwa na boobies na bumpkins pale, ambao, kwa kijani yao makali, lazima kuwa walitoka moyo na katikati ya verdure wote. Queequeg alimshika mmoja wa miche hii mchanga akimiga nyuma ya mgongo wake. Nilidhani saa ya bumpkin ya adhabu ilikuwa imefika. Kuacha chusa yake, savage brawny akamshika katika mikono yake, na kwa ustadi karibu miujiza na nguvu, akampeleka juu juu ya mwili katika hewa; kisha kidogo tapping wakali wake katika katikati ya Somerset, wenzake nanga na kupasuka mapafu juu ya miguu yake, wakati Queequeg, kugeuka nyuma yake juu yake, lighted tomahawk bomba yake na kupita kwa mimi kwa Puff.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Kunasa! Inavutia!” yelled bumpkin, mbio kuelekea afisa huyo; &quot;Kunasa, Kukamata, huyu ndiye shetani.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Hallo, 
      <i>
        wewe
      </i>
       bwana,&quot; kelele Kapteni, ubavu gaunt ya bahari, kunyemelea hadi Queequeg, &quot;nini katika radi unamaanisha na kwamba? Hujui labda umemuua huyo jamaa?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       “Anasema nini?” Alisema Queequeg, kama yeye upole akageuka na mimi.
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;Anasema,&quot; nilisema, &quot;kwamba ulikaribia kuua-e yule mtu huko,&quot; akizungumzia pembe ya kijani ambayo bado inatetemeka.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Ua-e,” akalia Queequeg, akikunja uso wake wenye tatoo kuwa usemi usio wa kidunia wa dharau, “ah! naye bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e nyangumi mkubwa!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Angalia wewe,” akanguruma Kapteni, “ 
      <i>
        nitakuua
      </i>
       , wewe mla nyama, ukijaribu mbinu zako zozote hapa; kwa hivyo jali jicho lako.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Lakini ilifanyika wakati huo, kwamba ilikuwa wakati muafaka kwa Kapteni kuzingatia macho yake mwenyewe. matatizo prodigious juu ya kuu-meli alikuwa wakagawana karatasi ya hali ya hewa, na boom kubwa sasa flying kutoka upande upande, kabisa yanayojitokeza mzima baada ya sehemu ya sitaha. wenzetu maskini ambao Queequeg alikuwa kubebwa hivyo takribani, ilikuwa swept overboard; mikono yote ilikuwa katika hofu; na kujaribu kuwanyakua boom ili kukaa, ilionekana kuwa wazimu. Iliruka kutoka kulia kwenda kushoto, na kurudi tena, karibu kwa kuashiria saa moja, na kila papo ilionekana kuwa karibu kupenya vipande vipande. Hakuna kilichofanyika, na hakuna kitu kilichoonekana kuwa na uwezo wa kufanywa; wale juu ya sitaha alikimbia kuelekea pinde, na kusimama eyeing boom kama ni taya ya chini ya nyangumi chukizwa. Katikati ya mshangao huu, Queequeg alianguka kwa magoti yake kwa ustadi, na kutambaa chini ya njia ya boom, akapiga kamba, akafunga ncha moja kwenye ngome, na kisha akaitupa nyingine kama lasso, akaikamata kuzunguka boom. kama swept juu ya kichwa chake, na katika jerk ijayo, spar ilikuwa kwa njia hiyo trapped, na wote walikuwa salama. Schooner ilipigwa na upepo, na wakati mikono ilikuwa ikiondoa mashua ya ukali, Queequeg, iliyovuliwa hadi kiuno, iliruka kutoka upande na safu ya muda mrefu ya kuruka. Kwa dakika tatu au zaidi alionekana akiogelea kama mbwa, akitupa mikono yake mirefu moja kwa moja mbele yake, na kwa zamu akifunua mabega yake yenye hasira kupitia povu lililoganda. Nilimtazama yule jamaa mkuu na mtukufu, lakini sikuona mtu wa kuokolewa. Pembe ya kijani ilikuwa imeshuka. Akijipiga risasi moja kwa moja kutoka kwenye maji, Queequeg, sasa alichukua mtazamo wa papo hapo karibu naye, na akionekana kuona jinsi mambo yalivyokuwa, akapiga mbizi na kutoweka. Dakika chache zaidi, na yeye akainuka tena, mkono mmoja bado fora nje, na kwa wengine akawatoa fomu isiyo na uhai. Upesi mashua iliwachukua. Bumpkin maskini ilirejeshwa. Mikono yote ilimpigia kura Queequeg tarumbeta bora; nahodha aliomba msamaha wake. Kuanzia saa hiyo naipenda Queequeg kama barnacle; ndio, hadi Queequeg maskini alipopiga mbizi kwa muda mrefu.
    </p>
    <p>
       Kulikuwa na kupoteza fahamu kama hiyo? Hakuonekana kufikiria kuwa alistahili medali hata kidogo kutoka kwa Jumuiya za Kibinadamu na Magnanimous. Aliomba tu maji—maji matamu—kitu cha kufuta ile brine; kwamba kufanyika, alivaa nguo kavu, lighted filimbi yake, na leaning dhidi ya ngome, na upole kwa macho wale walio karibu naye, walionekana kuwa na kusema mwenyewe-&quot;Ni kuheshimiana, pamoja-hisa dunia, katika meridians wote. Sisi walaji nyama lazima tuwasaidie Wakristo hawa.”

       SURA YA 14. Nantucket.
    </h2>
    <p>
       Hakuna zaidi kilichotokea kwenye kifungu kinachostahili kutajwa; kwa hiyo, baada ya kukimbia vizuri, tulifika salama Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
       Nantucket! Toa ramani yako na uitazame. Tazama kile kona halisi ya ulimwengu inachukuwa; jinsi inavyosimama pale, mbali na ufuo, upweke zaidi kuliko mnara wa taa wa Eddystone. Tazama - kilima tu, na kiwiko cha mchanga; pwani yote, bila msingi. Kuna mchanga mwingi hapo kuliko vile ungetumia katika miaka ishirini kama mbadala wa karatasi ya kubangua. Baadhi ya vitambaa vya mchezo vitakuambia kwamba wanapaswa kupanda magugu huko, hawakui kawaida; kwamba wanaingiza mbigili za Kanada; kwamba wanapaswa kupeleka ng&#39;ambo ya bahari kwa rundo la kuzuia uvujaji kwenye pipa la mafuta; kwamba vipande vya mbao huko Nantucket vinabebwa kama vipande vya msalaba wa kweli huko Roma; kwamba watu huko hupanda toadstools mbele ya nyumba zao, ili kupata chini ya kivuli katika majira ya joto; kwamba jani moja la nyasi hutengeneza chemchemi, majani matatu katika mwendo wa siku moja ya shamba; kwamba wanavaa viatu vya mchanga mwepesi, kitu kama viatu vya theluji vya Laplander; kwamba wao ni hivyo kufungwa, belted kuhusu, kila njia iliyoambatanishwa, kuzungukwa, na alifanya kisiwa kabisa ya na bahari, kwamba kwa viti vyao sana na meza clams ndogo wakati mwingine kupatikana waliandamana, kama kwa migongo ya turtle bahari. Lakini hizi za ziada zinaonyesha tu kwamba Nantucket sio Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
       Tazama sasa hadithi ya ajabu ya kitamaduni ya jinsi kisiwa hiki kilivyokaliwa na watu wekundu. Hivyo huenda hadithi. Hapo zamani za kale tai aliruka chini kwenye ufuo wa New England, na akamchukua mtoto mchanga Mhindi katika makucha yake. Kwa maombolezo makubwa wazazi walimwona mtoto wao akitolewa nje ya macho juu ya maji mengi. Waliazimia kufuata mwelekeo uleule. Wakiwa wamepanda mitumbwi yao, baada ya kupita njia hatari waligundua kisiwa hicho, na huko wakapata sanduku tupu la pembe za ndovu, yaani, mifupa ya maskini yule Mhindi.
    </p>
    <p>
       Basi, ni ajabu jinsi gani kwamba hawa Nantucketer, waliozaliwa kwenye ufuo wa bahari, wanapaswa kwenda baharini ili kujipatia riziki! Walikamata kwanza kaa na quohogs kwenye mchanga; huku wakiwa na ujasiri, walitoka nje na nyavu za makrill; wenye uzoefu zaidi, walisukuma kwenye boti na kukamata chewa; na hatimaye, kuzindua navy ya meli kubwa juu ya bahari, kutalii dunia hii ya maji; weka ukanda usio na mwisho wa kuzunguka pande zote; peeped katika Behring&#39;s Straits; na katika misimu yote na bahari zote zilitangaza vita vya milele na umati mkubwa zaidi wa uhuishaji ambao umeokoka gharika; zaidi ya kutisha na milima zaidi! Kwamba Himmalehan, Mastodon ya bahari ya chumvi, iliyovaliwa na nguvu nyingi za fahamu, kwamba hofu yake ni ya kuogopa zaidi kuliko mashambulizi yake ya kutoogopa na yenye nia mbaya!
    </p>
    <p>
       Na kwa hivyo hawa Nantucketer walio uchi, wanyama hawa wa baharini, wakitoa kutoka kwa kilima chao cha baharini, walipita na kuushinda ulimwengu wa maji kama Alexander wengi; kugawanya kati ya hizo bahari ya Atlantiki, Pasifiki, na Hindi, kama vile mataifa matatu ya maharamia yalivyofanya Poland. Acha Amerika iongeze Mexico huko Texas, na kulundika Cuba juu ya Kanada; Waingereza waijaze India yote, na kuning&#39;iniza bendera yao inayowaka kutoka kwenye jua; theluthi mbili ya dunia hii yenye maji mengi ni ya Nantucketer. Maana bahari ni yake; anaimiliki, kama Maliki wanavyomiliki himaya; mabaharia wengine wakiwa na haki ya kuipitia. Meli za wafanyabiashara ni madaraja tu; wenye silaha lakini ngome zinazoelea; hata maharamia na watu binafsi, ingawa wanafuata bahari kama wahalifu barabarani, lakini wanapora meli nyingine, vipande vingine vya nchi kama wao wenyewe, bila kutafuta kujipatia riziki zao kutoka kwenye kina kirefu chenyewe. Nantucketer, yeye peke yake anakaa na ghasia juu ya bahari; yeye peke yake, katika lugha ya Biblia, hushuka kwenda humo kwa merikebu; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. 
      <i>
        There
      </i>
       is his home; 
      <i>
        there
      </i>
       lies his business, which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

       CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
    <p>
       It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
       Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, 
      <i>
        two
      </i>
       of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
       I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I&#39;ll be combing ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There&#39;s Mrs. Hussey.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What&#39;s that about Cods, ma&#39;am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
       “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is 
      <i>
        that
      </i>
       what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says I, “but that&#39;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain&#39;t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
    </p>
    <p>
       But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?”
    </p>
    <p>
       However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
       We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&#39;s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain&#39;t that a live eel in your bowl? Where&#39;s your harpoon?”
    </p>
    <p>
       Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
       Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it&#39;s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of 
      <i>
        ile
      </i>
       , was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Both,” says I; “and let&#39;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.”

       CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
    <p>
       In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
       I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, this plan of Queequeg&#39;s, or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; 
      <i>
        how
      </i>
       it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. 
      <i>
        Devil-Dam
      </i>
       , I do not know the origin of; 
      <i>
        Tit-bit
      </i>
       is obvious; 
      <i>
        Pequod
      </i>
       , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
       You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.

       Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem&#39;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
       And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
       There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I was thinking of shipping.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “No, Sir, I never have.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
    <p>
       “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&#39;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I&#39;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don&#39;t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
       “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that&#39;s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#39;ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. 
      <i>
        Sure
      </i>
       , ye&#39;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don&#39;t aggravate me—I won&#39;t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I do, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&#39;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#39;t take to be the fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”
    </p>
    <p>
       For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#39;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
       Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what&#39;s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&#39;s a squall coming up, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&#39;t ye see the world where you stand?”
    </p>
    <p>
       I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
       Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
       So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
    </p>
    <p>
       As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He says he&#39;s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “I 
      <i>
        dost
      </i>
       ,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
       “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
       “He&#39;ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
       I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       , yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
       But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “ 
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#39;t be too much, would it?—&#39;where moth and rust do corrupt, but 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       —&#39;”
    </p>
    <p>
       
      <i>
        Lay
      </i>
       , indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not 
      <i>
        lay
      </i>
       up many 
      <i>
        lays
      </i>
       here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly 
      <i>
        long lay
      </i>
       that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a 
      <i>
        teenth
      </i>
       of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
       Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#39;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#39;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&#39;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&#39;ll—I&#39;ll—yes, I&#39;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
       As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#39;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#39;s thy name, didn&#39;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
       “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we&#39;ll look at him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Well, bring him along then.”
    </p>
    <p>
       And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning&#39;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
       But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#39;s all right enough; thou art shipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
       “But I don&#39;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#39;t look so. In fact, he ain&#39;t sick; but no, he isn&#39;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&#39;t always see me, so I don&#39;t suppose he will thee. He&#39;s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou&#39;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&#39;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&#39;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#39;s above the common; Ahab&#39;s been in colleges, as well as &#39;mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#39;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#39;t Captain Peleg; 
      <i>
        he&#39;s Ahab

       , boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”

       “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?”

       “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#39;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
