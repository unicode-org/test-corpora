      CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
    </h2>
<p>
      Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join
      them, and lay together our own.
    </p>
<p>
      Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
      Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly
      hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all
      the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them
      is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment
      hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we may freely go from one to the
      other, by merely stepping across the deck:—where, I should like to
      know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than
      here?
    </p>
<p>
      In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these
      heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain
      mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right Whale’s sadly
      lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head. As you behold
      it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of
      pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is
      heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving
      token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the
      fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”
     </p>
<p>
      Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the
      two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of
      the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you
      narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
      fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
      magnitude of the head.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is plain
      that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he
      can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s eyes
      corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how
      it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears.
      You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision
      in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more
      behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with
      dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more
      than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have
      two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side
      fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man—what, indeed,
      but his eyes?
    </p>
<p>
      Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes
      are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
      produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the
      whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid
      head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes
      in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which
      each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one
      distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side;
      while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man
      may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with
      two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are
      separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the
      view. This peculiarity of the whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne
      in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader in some
      subsequent scenes.
    </p>
<p>
      A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
      visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a
      hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is
      involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever
      objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience will teach him,
      that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one
      glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to
      examine any two things—however large or however small—at one
      and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and
      touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and
      surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one
      of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other
      will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,
      then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must
      simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,
      combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the same moment of time
      attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and
      the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as
      marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go
      through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor,
      strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.
    </p>
<p>
      It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
      extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset
      by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so
      common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the
      helpless perplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically
      opposite powers of vision must involve them.
    </p>
<p>
      But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an
      entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for
      hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf
      whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
      wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With
      respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed between
      the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has an external
      opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a
      membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world
      through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is
      smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of
      Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of
      cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
      hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?
      Subtilize it.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
      over the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by
      a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that
      the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might
      descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us
      hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What a really
      beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or
      rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.
    </p>
<p>
      But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like
      the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one end,
      instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and
      expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas!
      it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall
      with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms
      down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with
      his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at
      right-angles with his body, for all the world like a ship’s jib-boom. This
      whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;
      hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed,
      leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all his
      tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.
    </p>
<p>
      In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised
      artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of
      extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white
      whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
      including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.
    </p>
<p>
      With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
      anchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other
      work—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished
      dentists, are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg
      lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle
      being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag
      stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two
      teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled
      after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and
      piled away like joists for building houses.

      CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
    </h2>
<p>
      Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale’s
      head.
    </p>
<p>
      As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a
      Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);
      so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather inelegant
      resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old
      Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker’s last. And in this
      same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming
      brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.
    </p>
<p>
      But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
      aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and
      look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for
      an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its
      sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
      crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,
      barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the Southern
      fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this,
      you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird’s nest
      in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle
      here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you;
      unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term “crown”
       also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in
      thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea,
      whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner.
      But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a
      diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is
      there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long
      and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons
      of oil and more.
    </p>
<p>
      A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The
      fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important
      interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the
      beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide
      into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be
      the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah
      went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp
      angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed,
      arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical,
      scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which
      depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form those
      Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The edges
      of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right
      Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small
      fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time.
      In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there
      are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some
      whalemen calculate the creature’s age, as the age of an oak by its
      circular rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from
      demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At any rate,
      if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than
      at first glance will seem reasonable.
    </p>
<p>
      In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
      concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
      “whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a
      third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
      “There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
      upper <i>chop</i>, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”
     </p>
<p>
      *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or
      rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper
      part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a
      rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance.
    </p>
<p>
      As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”
       “blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
      other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long
      been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was in its
      glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those ancient
      dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you may say;
      even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly
      under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over
      the same bone.
    </p>
<p>
      But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing
      in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these
      colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you
      were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand
      pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey—the
      tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very
      fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This
      particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a
      six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.
    </p>
<p>
      Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with—that
      the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads.
      To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no great well of sperm; no
      ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the
      Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of
      bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the
      Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
    </p>
<p>
      Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie
      together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will
      not be very long in following.
    </p>
<p>
      Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same he
      died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded
      away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born
      of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head’s
      expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the
      vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head
      seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This
      Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who
      might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.

      CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.
    </h2>
<p>
      Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you, as
      a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front
      aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate
      it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated,
      intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there.
      Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle this
      matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most
      appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be found in
      all recorded history.
    </p>
<p>
      You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the
      front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water;
      you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably
      backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
      receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely
      under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth
      were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has no
      external nose; and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is on
      the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides
      of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.
      Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale’s
      head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of
      any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the
      extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there
      the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from
      the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that this
      whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon
      be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you
      are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably
      invests all that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have
      described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind
      wraps an orange. Just so with the head; but with this difference: about
      the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness,
      inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed
      harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently
      rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were
      paved with horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
    </p>
<p>
      Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
      chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
      sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
      contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there
      a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest
      of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have
      snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By itself this
      sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to
      this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess
      what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of distension
      or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know, has no such
      provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable manner in
      which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and anon
      swims with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed
      elasticity of its envelope; considering the unique interior of his head;
      it has hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical
      lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and
      unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to
      atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the
      irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
      destructive of all elements contributes.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall,
      and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass of
      tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is—by
      the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So
      that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and
      concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster;
      when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats; I
      trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, and be ready to
      abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the
      Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not
      elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are
      but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing
      for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the
      provincials then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread
      goddess’s veil at Lais?

      CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.
    </h2>
<p>
      Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
      know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
      upon.
    </p>
<p>
      Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
      inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower is
      the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
      unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
      expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
      forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
      almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
      wall of a thick tendinous substance.
    </p>
<p>
      *Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
      mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
      solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
      steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
      sides.
    </p>
<p>
      The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
      oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated
      cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The
      upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh
      Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is mystically
      carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable
      strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun.
      Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most
      excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale
      contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the
      highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous
      state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of
      the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon
      exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending
      forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is
      just forming in water. A large whale’s case generally yields about five
      hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances,
      considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise
      irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.
    </p>
<p>
      I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
      coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly
      have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the lining of
      a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale’s case.
    </p>
<p>
      It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
      embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as
      has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the
      whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet
      for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth
      of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship’s
      side.
    </p>
<p>
      As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought close
      to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti
      magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,
      untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its
      invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which
      is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the
      enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side, make
      quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in
      this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
      Whale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.

      CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.
    </h2>
<p>
      Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
      posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the part
      where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a
      light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling
      through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down
      from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and
      firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part,
      the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit
      of the head. There—still high elevated above the rest of the
      company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish Muezzin
      calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
      short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for
      the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he
      proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
      sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this
      cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a
      well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other
      end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert
      hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom
      another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into
      the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it
      entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up
      comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid’s pail of new milk.
      Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by
      an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting
      aloft, it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will
      yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder
      and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of
      the pole have gone down.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
      several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a
      queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian,
      was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold
      on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the place
      where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One
      himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular
      reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden, as
      the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up—my God! poor
      Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,
      dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a
      horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!
    </p>
<p>
      “Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
      came to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot into
      it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself,
      the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost before
      Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a
      terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before lifeless head
      throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment
      seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian
      unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he
      had sunk.
    </p>
<p>
      At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the
      whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a
      sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one
      of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast
      vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and
      shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the
      entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be on the point of
      giving way; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the
      head.
    </p>
<p>
      “Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
      holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would
      still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed
      down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried
      harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.
    </p>
<p>
      “In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge
      there?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket
      on top of his head? Avast, will ye!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket.
    </p>
<p>
      Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass dropped
      into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly
      relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper; and
      all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the sailors’
      heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray,
      was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
      buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea!
      But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked figure with
      a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen hovering over
      the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had
      dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and every eye
      counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the
      sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat
      alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
      overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
      upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
      forth from the grass over a grave.
    </p>
<p>
      “Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful
      shout; and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one
      hand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into
      the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was
      long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the
      slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges
      near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his
      sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out
      poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a
      leg was presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be,
      and might occasion great trouble;—he had thrust back the leg, and by
      a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so
      that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way—head
      foremost. As for the great head itself, that was doing as well as could be
      expected.
    </p>
<p>
      And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,
      the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully
      accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently
      hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.
      Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing,
      riding and rowing.
    </p>
<p>
      I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to seem
      incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen
      or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which
      not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian’s,
      considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale’s
      well.
    </p>
<p>
      But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought
      the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and
      most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a
      far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all,
      but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly
      emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous
      wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance, as I have
      before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in
      it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance
      was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of
      the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and
      deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his
      agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it was a running
      delivery, so it was.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
      perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
      spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and
      sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
      recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking
      honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it,
      that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How
      many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and sweetly
      perished there?

      CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.
    </h2>
<p>
      To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
      Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as
      yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for
      Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for
      Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon.
      Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of the various
      faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of horses, birds,
      serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of
      expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim
      failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics
      of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a
      pioneer, in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I
      will do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.
    </p>
<p>
      Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
      has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous
      of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls
      their combined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as
      an external appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the
      whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower
      of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the
      scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated
      open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias’s marble Jove,
      and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a
      magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency
      which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.
      Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been
      impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head
      in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by
      the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which
      so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest
      royal beadle on his throne.
    </p>
<p>
      In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be
      had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect
      is sublime.
    </p>
<p>
      In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
      morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a
      touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the
      elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that
      great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their decrees. It
      signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most creatures,
      nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land
      lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare’s
      or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves
      seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the
      forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending
      there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.
      But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity
      inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that
      full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly
      than in beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one
      point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes,
      ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad
      firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the
      doom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous
      brow diminish; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon
      you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
      depression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark of
      genius.
    </p>
<p>
      But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a
      book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing
      nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical
      silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to
      the young Orient World, he would have been deified by their child-magian
      thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is
      tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so
      exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any
      highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the
      merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now
      egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to
      Jove’s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.
    </p>
<p>
      Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no
      Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s face.
      Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If
      then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the
      simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how
      may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale’s
      brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you can.

      CHAPTER 80. The Nut.
    </h2>
<p>
      If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his
      brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.
    </p>
<p>
      In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in
      length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the
      side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base.
      But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is
      angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
      mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to
      bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in
      another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth—reposes
      the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at least twenty
      feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast
      outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications
      of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have
      known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any
      other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards
      of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions,
      to their apprehensions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of his
      general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his
      intelligence.
    </p>
<p>
      It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the
      creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true
      brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale,
      like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.
    </p>
<p>
      If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of
      its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance
      to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point
      of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human
      magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would involuntarily
      confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on one part of its
      summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man had no
      self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations, considered along
      with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best
      form to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception
      of what the most exalted potency is.
    </p>
<p>
      But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you
      deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea
      for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you will
      be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung necklace of
      dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It
      is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely undeveloped skulls.
      But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the
      first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the
      skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebræ of which he was
      inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I
      consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not
      pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.
      For I believe that much of a man’s character will be found betokened in
      his backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you
      are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I
      rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I
      fling half out to the world.
    </p>
<p>
      Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
      cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
      the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight
      in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As it
      passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but for a
      considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this
      canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the
      spinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain.
      And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s
      cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to
      that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable
      to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in
      this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is
      more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal
      cord.
    </p>
<p>
      But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would
      merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm
      Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the
      larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould
      of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the
      organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the
      great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.
