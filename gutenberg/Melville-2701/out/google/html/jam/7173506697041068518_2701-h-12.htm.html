<h2 id="pgepubid00060">CHAPTER 55. A di Monstrous Pictures a Whales.</h2>
<p>Mi ago ere long paint to yuh as well as one can widout canvas, someting like di true form a di whale as him actually appear to di eye a di whaleman wen inna him own absolute body di whale is moored alongside di whale-ship so dat him can be fairly step upon deh. It may be worth while, therefore, previously fi advert to dem curious imaginary portraits a him weh even dung to di present day confidently challenge di faith a di landsman. A time fi set di worl right inna dis matter, by proving such pictures of di whale all wrong.</p>
<p>It may be dat di primal source a all dem pictorial delusions deh wi find mongst di oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, an Grecian sculptures. Fi ever since dem inventive but unscrupulous times deh wen pan di marble panellings a di temples, di pedestals a di statues, an pan di shields, medallions, cups, an coins, di dolphin did a draw inna scales a chain-armor like Saladin's, an a helmeted head like St. George's; ever since den have someting a di same sort a license prevailed, not only inna most popular pictures a di whale, but inna plenty scientific presentations a him.</p>
<p>Now, by all odds, di most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting fi be di whale's, is fi be found inna di famous cavern-pagoda a Elephanta, in India. Di Brahmins dem maintain seh inna di almost endless sculptures a dat deh immemorial pagoda, all di trades an pursuits, every conceivable avocation a man, did prefigured ages before any a dem actually come into being. No wonder den, dat inna some sort wi noble profession a whaling shuda did deh deh shadowed forth. Di Hindoo whale weh dem call, deh inna one separate department a di wall, weh did a depict di incarnation a Vishnu inna di form a leviathan, weh dem call di Matse Avatar. But though dis sculpture a half man an half whale, so as only fi gi di tail a di latta, yet dat deh likkle section a him all wrong. It look more like di tapering tail a one anaconda, dan di broad palms a di true whale's majestic flukes.</p>
<p>But go a di ole Galleries, an look now pon a great Christian painter's portrait a dis fish; fi him succeed no beta dan di antediluvian Hindoo. A Guido's picture a Perseus rescuing Andromeda fram di sea-monster or whale. Weh Guido get di model a such a strange creature as dat? Nor does Hogarth, inna di painting di same scene inna him own “Perseus Descending,” mek out one whit better. Di huge corpulence a dat deh Hogarthian monster undulate pan di surface, scarcely drawing one inch a water. It have a sort a howdah pan it back, an it distended tusked mouth in which di billows dem a roll, might be taken fi di Traitors' Gate weh lead fram di Thames by water inna di Tower. Den, deh deh di Prodromus whales a uol Scotch Sibbald, an Jonah's whale, as dem pikcha inna di prints a uol Bibles an di cuts a uol primers. Weh dem fi seh bout dem yah? As fi di book-binder's whale winding like a vine-stalk round di stock a one descending anchor—as stamped an gilded pan di backs an title-pages a plenty books both old an new—dat a one very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, mi tek it, fram di like figures pan antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, mi nevertheless call dis book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; bikaa it did so intended wen di device did fos introduce. It did introduce by an ole Italian publisher somwe bout di 15th century, during di Revival of Learning; an inna dem days deh, an even dung to a comparatively late period, dolphins did popularly suppose fi be a species a di Leviathan.</p>
<p>Inna di vignettes an ada embellishments a some ancient books yuh wi at times meet wid very curious touches at di whale, weh all manner a spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs an cold, Saratoga an Baden-Baden, come bubbling up fram him unexhausted brain. Inna di title-page a di original edition a di “Advancement of Learning” yuh wi find some curious whales.</p>
<p>But quitting all dem unprofessional attempts, mek wi glance at dem pictures a leviathan purporting fi be sober, scientific delineations, by dem who know. Inna old Harris's collection a voyages deh deh some plates a whales weh dem tek outa a Dutch book a voyages, AD 1671, weh dem call “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen inna di ship Jonas inna di Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” Inna one a dem plates deh di whales, like great rafts a logs, dem represent laying mongst ice-isles, wid white bears a run ova dem living backs. Inna wan neks plate, di prodigious blunder mek outa representing di whale wid perpendicular flukes.</p>
<p>Den agen, deh have a imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a Post Captain inna di English navy, entitled “A Voyage round Cape Horn into di South Seas, fi di purpose a extend di Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.” Inna dis book is an outline weh purporting to be a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one weh dem did kill pan di coast a Mexico, August, 1793, an hoisted pan deck.” Mi doubt not di captain did have dis veracious picture tek fi di benefit a him marines. Fi mention but one ting bout it, mek mi seh dat it have an eye weh apply, according to di accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, woulda mek di eye a dat deh whale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, mi galant captain, why yuh neva gi wi Jonah looking outa dat deh eye!</p>
<p>Nor are di most conscientious compilations of Natural History fi di benefit a di young an tender, free fram di same heinousness a mistake. Look pan dat deh popular work “Goldsmith's Animated Nature.” Inna di abridged London edition a 1807, deh have plates a one alleged “whale” an a “narwhale.” Mi no waan seem inelegant, but dis unsightly whale look much like an amputated sow; an, as fi di narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough fi amaze one, dat inna dis nineteenth century such a hippogriff coulda be palmed fi genuine upon any intelligent public a schoolboys.</p>
<p>Den, again, inna 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great naturalist, publish a scientific systemized whale book, weh have several pictures a di different species a di Leviathan. All dem deh nuh only incorrect, but di picture a di Mysticetus or Greenland whale (dat is fi seh, di Right whale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man as touching dat deh species, declare seh him nuh have it counterpart inna nature.</p>
<p>But di placing a di cap-sheaf to all dis blundering business was reserved fi di scientific Frederick Cuvier, bredda to di famous Baron. Inna 1836, him publish a Natural History of Whales, in which him gi weh him call a picture a di Sperm Whale. Bifuo yuh show dat deh picture to any Nantucketer, yuh had best provide fi yuh summary retreat fram Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale a nuh Sperm Whale, but a squash. A chuu, him neva have di benefit a a whaling voyage (dem deh man deh seldom have), but weh him get dat deh picture, who can tell? Miebi him get it as him scientific predecessor inna di same field, Desmarest, get one a him authentic abortions; dat is, fram a Chinese drawing. An weh sort a lively lads wid di pencil dem Chinese deh, plenty queer cups an saucers inform wi.</p>
<p>As fi di sign-painters' whales dem weh yuh see inna di streets a hang ova di shops a oil-dealers, weh dem fi seh bout dem? Dem a generally Richard III. whales, wid dromedary humps, an very savage; breakfasting pan three or four sailor tarts, dat a whaleboats full a mariners: dem deformities floundering inna seas a blood an blue paint.</p>
<p>But dem manifold mistakes inna di depicting di whale dem nuh so very surprising afta all. Cansida! Most a di scientific drawings dem tek fram di stranded fish dem; an dem deh bout as correct as a drawing a one wrecked ship, wid broken back, woulda correctly represent di noble animal itself inna all it undashed pride a hull an spars. Though elephants have standed fi dem full-lengths, di living Leviathan neva yet fairly float himself fi him portrait. Di living whale, inna him full majesty an significance, is only fi be seen at sea inna unfathomable waters; an afloat di vast bulk a him out a sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; an outa dat deh element it a ting weh eternally impossible fi mortal man fi hoist him bodily inna di air, so as fi preserve all him mighty swells an undulations. An, not fi taak bout di highly presumable difference a contour between a young sucking whale an a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even inna di case a one a dem young sucking whales weh did hoist to a ship's deck, such is den di outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape a him, dat him precise expression di devil himself couldn't catch.</p>
<p>But it may be fancied, dat fram di naked skeleton a di stranded whale, accurate hints may be derived touching him true form. No sah. For it a one a di more curious ting bout dis Leviathan, dat him skeleton gi very likkle idea a him general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, weh hang fi candelabra inna di library a one a him executors, correctly convey di idea a one burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, wid all Jeremy's ada leading personal characteristics; yet notn a dis kain coulda be inferred fram any leviathan's articulated bones. In fact, as di great Hunter seh, di mere skeleton a di whale bear di same relation to di fully invested an padded animal as di insect do to di chrysalis weh so roundingly envelope it. Dis peculiarity is strikingly evinced inna di head, as in some part a dis book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed inna di side fin, di bones dem weh almost exactly ansa to di bones dem a di human han, minus only di thumb. Dis fin have four regular bone-finga, di index, middle, ring, an likkle finga. But all dem deh permanently lodged inna dem fleshy covering, as di human fingers inna an artificial covering. “However recklessly di whale may sometimes serve wi,” seh humorous Stubb one day, “im can neva truly seh fi handle wi widout mittens.”</p>
<p>Fi all dem reasons yah, den, any way yuh may look pon it, yuh haffi need fi conclude seh di great Leviathan a dat deh one creature inna di worl weh haffi remain unpainted to di last. True, one portrait may hit di mark much nearer dan anodda one, but none can hit it wid any very considerable degree of exactness. So no earthly way nuh deh fi find out precisely how di whale really look. An di only mode in which yuh can derive even a tolerable idea of ​​him living contour, is by going a whaling yuhself; but by so doing, yuh run no small risk a being eternally stove an sunk by him. So, it look like mi yuh had not be too fastidious inna yuh curiosity touching dis Leviathan.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00061">CHAPTER 56. A di Less Erroneous Pictures a Whales, an di True Pictures a Whaling Scenes.</h2>
<p>In connexion wid di monstrous pictures a whales, mi strongly tempted yah fi enter pan dem still more monstrous stories a dem weh yuh can find inna certain books, both ancient an modern, especially inna Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But mi pass dat matter by.</p>
<p>Mi know bout only four published outlines a di great Sperm Whale; Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, an Beale's. Inna di previous chapter dem did a taak bout Colnett an Cuvier. Huggins's is far better dan dem; but, by great odds, Beale's a di bes. All Beale's drawings a dis whale good, except di middle figure inna di picture a three whales inna various attitudes, capping him secan chapter. Him frontispice, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated fi excite di civil skepticism a some parlor man, is admirably correct an life-like inna its general effect. Som a di Sperm Whale drawing dem inna J. Ross Browne dem pretty correct inna contour; but dem wretchedly engraved. Dat a nuh him fault though.</p>
<p>A di Right Whale, di bes outline picture dem deh inna Scoresby; but dem draw pan too small a scale fi convey a desirable impression. Im have only one picture a whaling scenes, an dis a one sad deficiency, cause a by such pictures only, wen at all well done, dat yuh can derive anyting like a truthful idea a di living whale as seen by him living hunters.</p>
<p>But, tek fi all in all, by far di finest, though inna some details not di most correct, presentations a whales an whaling scenes fi be anywhere found, a two big French engravings, well executed, an tek fram paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, dem represent attacks pan di Sperm an Right Whale. Inna di fos engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depict inna full majesty a might, jus risen beath di boat fram di profundities a di ocean, an bearing high inna di air upon him back di terrific wreck a di stoven planks. Di prow a di boat partially unbroken, an it drawn jus balancing upon di monster's spine; an standing inna dat deh prow, fi dat one single incomputable flash a time, yuh behold an oarsman, half shrouded by di incensed boiling spout a di whale, an inna di act a leaping, as if fram a precipice. Di action a di whole ting is wonderfully good an true. Di half-emptied line-tub float pan di whitened sea; di wooden poles a di spilled harpoons obliquely bob inna it; di head dem a di swimming crew dem scatter roun di whale inna contrasting expressions a affright; while inna di black stormy distance di ship a bear dung upon di scene. Serious fault might be found wid di anatomical details a dis whale, but mek dat pass; since, fi di life a mi, mi couldn't draw so good a one.</p>
<p>Inna di secan engraving, di boat deh inna di act a drawing alongside di barnacled flank a one big running Right Whale, weh roll him black weedy bulk inna di sea like some mossy rock-slide fram di Patagonian cliffs. Him jets dem erect, full, an black like soot; so dat fram so abundant a smoke inna di chimney, yuh woulda tink seh mosi a brate supper a cook inna di great bowels below. Sea fowls a peck at di small crabs, shell-fish, an other sea candies an makaroni, weh di Right Whale sometimes carry pan him pestilent back. An all di while di thick-lipped leviathan a rush thru di deep, lef tons a tumultuous white curds inna him wake, an a cause di slight boat fi rock inna di swells like a skiff weh ketch nigh di paddle-wheels a one ocean steamer. So, di foreground a all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is di glassy level a one sea becalmed, di drooping unstarched sails a di powerless ship, an di inert mass a one dead whale, a conquered fortress, wid di flag a capture lazily hanging fram di whale-pole inserted inna him spout-hole.</p>
<p>A who Garnery di painter is, or was, mi nuh know. But mi life fi it him was either practically conversant wid him subject, or else marvelously tutored by some experienced whaleman. Di French dem a di lads fi painting action. Go an look pan all di paintings dem a Europe, an weh yuh wi find such a gallery a living an breathing commotion pan canvas, as inna dat deh triumphal hall at Versailles; weh di beholder fight him way, pell-mell, chruu di consecutive great battles a France; weh every sword look like a flash a di Northern Lights, an di successive armed kings an Emperors dash by, like a charge a crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy a place inna dat deh gallery, are dem sea battle-pieces a Garnery.</p>
<p>Di natural aptitude a di French fi seize di picturesqueness a tings seem fi be peculiarly evinced inna weh paintings an engravings dem have a dem whaling scenes. Wid not one tenth a England's experience inna di fishery, an not di thousandth part a dat a di Americans, dem have nevertheless furnished both nations wid di only finished sketches at all capable fi convey di real spirit a di whale hunt. Fi di most part, di English an American whale draughtsmen dem seem entirely content wid presenting di mechanical outline a tings, such as di vacant profile a di whale; weh, so far as picturesqueness a effect is concerned, is bout tantamount to sketching di profile a one pyramid. Even Scoresby, di justly renowned Right whaleman, afta him gi wi a stiff full length a di Greenland whale, an three or four delicate miniatures a narwhales an porpoises, treat wi to a series a classical engravings a boat hooks, chopping knives, an grapnels; an wid di microscopic diligence a one Leuwenhoeck submits to di inspection a one shivering world ninety-six fac-similes a magnified Arctic snow crystals. Mi mean no disparagement to di excellent voyager (mi honor him fi a veteran), but inna so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not fi have procured fi every crystal a sworn affidavit tek before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.</p>
<p>In addition to dem fine engravings fram Garnery, deh deh two ada French engravings weh worthy a note, by some one weh subscribe himself “H. Durand.” One a dem, though not precisely adapted to wi present purpose, nevertheless deserve mention pan other accounts. A one quiet noon-scene mongst di isles a di Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, inna a calm, an lazily tek water pan board; di loosened sails a di ship, an di long leaves a di palms inna di background, both a drooping tugeda inna di breezeless air. Di effect is very fine, wen yuh consider it wid reference to it presenting di hardy fishermen dem unda one a dem few aspects a oriental repose. Di ada engraving a quite a different affair: di ship hove-to upon di open sea, an inna di very heart a di Leviathanic life, wid a Right Whale alongside; di vessel (in di act a cutting-in) hove ova to di monster as if to a quay; an a boat, hurriedly pushing off fram dis scene a activity, is bout giving chase to whales inna di distance. Di harpoons an lances dem lay leveled fi use; three oarsmen a jus set di mast inna it hole; while fram a sudden roll a di sea, di likkle craft stan op half-erect outa di wata, like a rearing horse. Fram di ship, di smoke a di torments a di boiling whale a go up like di smoke ova a village a smithies; an to windward, a black cloud, rising up wid earnest a squalls an rains, seems fi quicken di activity a di excited seamen dem.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00062">CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; inna Teeth; inna Wood; inna Sheet-Iron; inna Stone; inna Mountains; inna Stars.</h2>
<p>Pan Tower-hill, as yuh go dung to di London docks, yuh may have seen a crippled beggar (or <i>kedger</i> , as di sailors seh) a hold a painted board before him, representing di tragic scene in which him lose him leg. Dem have three whales an three boats; an one a di boats dem (presumed fi contain di missing leg inna all it original integrity) a get crunched by di jaws a di foremost whale. Any time dem ten years yah, dem tell mi, dat deh man deh hold up dat deh picture, an exhibit dat stump to an incredulous world. Bot di taim kom nou fi get rait wid Gad. Him three whales dem a as good whales as dem did eva publish inna Wapping, at any rate; an him stump as unquestionable a stump as any yuh wi find inna di western clearings. But, though fi ever mounted pan dat deh stump, neva a stump-speech do di poor whaleman mek; but, wid downcast eyes, stan up ruefully contemplating him own amputation.</p>
<p>Thruout di Pacific, an also inna Nantucket, an New Bedford, an Sag Harbor, yuh wi come across lively sketches a whales an whaling-scenes, weh di fishermen demself did grave pan Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies' busks weh dem mek outa di Right Whale-bone, an ada like scrimshander arles, as di numerous likkle ingenietic arles dem call di whalemen contrivances dem elaborately carve out a di rough material, inna dem hours a ocean leisure. Som a dem have likkle boxes a dentistical-looking implements, specially intended fi di skrimshandering business. But, in general, dem toil wid dem jack-knives alone; an, wid dat deh almost omnipotent tool a di sailor, dem ago turn yuh out anyting yuh please, inna di way a mariner's fancy.</p>
<p>Long exile fram Christendom an civilization inevitably restore a man to dat deh condition in which God put him, <i>ie</i> weh dem call savagery. Yuh true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. Miself a one savage, weh nuh have no allegiance but to di King a di Cannibals; an ready at any moment fi rebel against him.</p>
<p>Now, one a di peculiar characteristics a di savage inna him domestic hours, a him wonderful patience a industry. An ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, inna it full multiplicity an elaboration a carving, a as great a trophy a human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, wid but a bit a broken sea-shell or a shark's tooth, dat deh miraculous intricacy a wooden net-work don achieve; an it cost steady years a steady application.</p>
<p>As wid di Hawaiian savage, so wid di white sailor-savage. Wid di same marvelous patience, an wid di same single shark's tooth, a him one poor jack-knife, him ago carve yuh a bit a bone sculpture, not quite as workmanlike, but as close packed inna its maziness of design, as di Greek savage, Achilles's shield; an full a barbaric spirit an suggestiveness, as di prints a dat deh fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.</p>
<p>Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile outa di likkle dark slabs a di noble South Sea war-wood, dem frequently meet wid inna di forecastle a American whalers. Som a dem done wid much accuracy.</p>
<p>At some old gable-roofed country houses yuh wi see brass whales hang by di tail fi knockers to di road-side door. Wen di porter sleepy, di anvil-headed whale woulda be best. But dem knocking whales yah seldom remarkable as faithful essays. Pan di spiers a some old-fashioned churches yuh wi si sheet-iron whales weh dem put deh fi weather-cocks; but dem so elevated, an besides dat dem to all intents an purposes so label wid “ <i>Hands off!</i> ” yuh cyaan examine dem closely enough fi decide upon dem merit.</p>
<p>Inna di bony, ribby regions a di earth, weh at di base a high broken cliffs mass a rock lie strewn inna fantastic groupings pan di plain, yuh wi often discover images as a di petrified forms a di Leviathan partly merged inna grass, weh a windy day break against dem inna a surf a green surges.</p>
<p>Den, again, inna mountainous countries weh di traveller dem continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; yah an deh fram some lucky point a view yuh wi catch passing glimpses a di profiles a whales weh define along di undulating ridges. But yuh haffi be a thorough whaleman, fi see dem sights yah; an not only dat, but if yuh waan go back to such a sight again, yuh haffi be sure an tek di exact intersecting latitude an longitude a yuh first stand-point, else so chance-like are such observations of di hills, dat yuh precise, previous stand-point woulda require a laborous re-discovery; like di Soloma Islands, weh still remain incognita, though once high-ruffed Mendanna did a trod dem an old Figuera did a chronicle dem.</p>
<p>Nor wen expandingly lifted by yuh subject, yuh can fail fi trace out great whales inna di starry heavens, an boats inna pursuit a dem; az wen lang ful a tings a waar di Iis nieshan dem si aami dem lak op ina fait mongx di kloud dem. So at di North mi did a chase Leviathan roun an roun di Pole wid di revolutions a di bright points dem weh did fos define him to mi. An anda di effulgent Antarctic skies mi don board di Argo-Navis, an jain di chase gens di starry Cetus far beyond di utmost stretch a Hydrus an di Flying Fish.</p>
<p>Wid a frigate's anchors fi mi bridle-bitts an fasces a harpoons fi spurs, woulda mi coulda mount dat deh whale an leap di topmost skies, fi see weda di fabled heavens wid all dem countless tents really lie encamped beyond mi mortal sight!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00063">CHAPTER 58. Brit.</h2>
<p>Steering north-eastward fram di Crozetts, we fall in wid vast meadows a brit, di minute, yellow substance, upon which di Right Whale largely feed. Fi leagues an leagues it undulate roun wi, so dat wi did look like wi did a sail thru boundless fields a ripe an golden wheat.</p>
<p>Pan di secan day, dem did si numba a Right Whales, who, secure fram di attack a one Sperm Whaler like di Pequod, wid open jaws sluggishly swim thru di brit, weh, adhering to di fringing fibers a dat deh wondrous Venetian blind inna dem mout, did inna dat deh manner separate fram di wata weh did a escape at di lip.</p>
<p>As morning mowers, who side by side slowly an seethingly advance dem scythes through di long wet grass a marshy meads; even so dem monsters yah swim, mek a strange, grassy, ​​cutting sound; an lef bihain dem endless swaths a blue pan di yellow sea.*</p>
<p>*Dat paat a di sii weh di whalemen dem kaal di “Brazil Banks” no gat dat de niem laik di Banks a Newfoundland, bikaaz a shallows an soundings de de, bot bikaaz a dis remarkable meadow-like appearance, kaaz bai di vast drifts a brit weh kantinyu fi flot inna demde latitudes, weh di Right Whale a chaten a chaten.</p>
<p>But a did only di sound dem mek as dem did a part di brit weh at all remind one a mowers. Siem fram di mast-hed dem, espeshali wen dem did a paas an did a stie fi a wail, dem big blak faam luk muor laik laifles mas a rak dan eniting els. An as inna di great hunting countries a India, di stranger at a distance will sometimes pass pan di plains recumbent elephants widout knowing dem fi be such, tek dem fi bare, blackened elevations a di soil; even so, often, wid him, who fi di first time behold dis species a di leviathans a di sea. An even wen dem recognize at last, dem immense magnitude renders it very hard fi believe seh such bulky masses a overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, wid di same sort a life weh live inna a dog or a horse.</p>
<p>Indeed, inna ada tings, yuh can hardly regard any creatures of di deep wid di same feelings weh yuh do dem of di shore. For though some old naturalists did maintain seh all creatures a di lan a dem kind inna di sea; an though tek a broad general view a di ting, dis maita very well be; yet coming to specialties, weh, fi example, di ocean furnish any fish weh in disposition ansa to di sagacious kindness a di dog? Di accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.</p>
<p>But though, to landsmen in general, di native inhabitants a di seas dem eva get regarded wid emotions unspeakably unsocial an repelling; though we know di sea a one everlasting terra incognita, so dat Columbus sail ova numberless unknown worlds fi discover him one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, di most terrific a all mortal disasters have immemorially an indiscriminately befallen tens an hundreds a thousands a dem who have gone upon di waters; though but a moment's consideration will teach, dat however baby man may brag of him science and skill, and however much, in a flattering future, dat science and skill may augment; yet fi eva an fi eva, tu di crack a doom, di sea ago insult an murder him, an pulverize di stateliest, stiffest frigate weh him can mek; nevertheless, by di continual repetition a dem very impressions, man don lost dat sense a di full awfulness a di sea weh aboriginal belong to it.</p>
<p>Di fos boat we did read bout, did a float pan an ocean, weh wid Portuguese vengeance did whelmed a whole worl widout leaving so much as a widow. Dat deh same ocean rolls now; dat deh same ocean destroy di wrecked ships a last year. Yee, foolish mortals, Noah's flood neva subside yet; two thirds a di fair worl it yet cover.</p>
<p>Weh di sea an di lan different, dat a miracle pan one a nuh miracle pan di ada? Preternatural terrors rest pan di Hebrews, wen unda di foot a Korah an him company di live ground open an swallow dem up fi eva; yet not a modern sun ever set, but in precisely di same manner di live sea swallow up ships an crews.</p>
<p>But not only di sea is such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse dan di Persian host weh did morder him own guests; no spare di creatures dem weh itself did spawn. Like a savage tigress weh tossing inna di jungle overlay har own cubs, so di sea dash even di mightiest whales against di rocks, an lef dem deh side by side wid di split wrecks a ships. No mercy, no power but it own control it. Panting an snorting like a mad battle steed weh lost it rider, di masterless ocean overrun di globe.</p>
<p>Tingk bout di subtleness a di sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide unda water, unapparent fi di most part, an treacherously hidden beath di loveliest tints a azure. Consider also di devilish brilliance an beauty a plenty a it most remorseless tribes, as di dainty embellished shape a plenty species a sharks. Consider, once more, di universal cannibalism a di sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since di world began.</p>
<p>Tingk bout aal a dis; an den turn to dis green, gentle, an most docile earth; tink bout dem both, di sea an di lan; an yuh no find a strange analogy to someting inna yuhself? For as dis appalling ocean surround di verdant lan, so inna di soul a man deh deh one insular Tahiti, full a peace an joy, but encompassed by all di horrors a di half known life. God keep yuh! No push off fram dat deh isle, yuh cyaan neva come back!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00064">CHAPTER 59. Squid.</h2>
<p>Slowly wading thru di meadows a brit, di Pequod still did a hold pan har way north-eastward towards di island a Java; a gentle air impelling har keel, so dat inna di surrounding serenity har three tall tapering masts mildly wave to dat deh languid breeze, as three mild palms pan a plain. An still, at wide intervals inna di silvery night, di lonely, alluring jet woulda be seen.</p>
<p>But one transparent blue morning, wen a stillness almost preternatural spread ova di sea, however unattended wid any stagnant calm; wen di long burnished sun-glade pan di waters did a look like a golden finger did a lay across dem, a enjoin some secrecy; wen di slippered waves dem whisper tugeda as dem softly run on; inna dis profound hush a di visible sphere a strange specter did si Daggoo fram di main-mast-head.</p>
<p>Inna di distance, a great white mass lazily rose, an rising higher an higher, an disentangling itself fram di azure, at last gleamed before wi prow like a snow-slide, new slid fram di hills. So glistening fi a moment, as slowly it subsided, an sank. Den once more arise, an silently gleamed. It did look like a nuh whale; an yet dis a Moby Dick? Daggoo did tink. Again di phantom go dung, but pan re-appearing once more, wid a stiletto-like cry weh startle every man fram him nod, di negro yell out—“Deh! deh again! deh she breaches! right ahead! Di White Whale, di White Whale!”</p>
<p>Pan dis, di seamen dem rush to di yard-arms, as inna swarming-time di bees dem rush to di boughs. Bare-headed inna di sultry sun, Ahab did a stan up pan di bowsprit, an wid one han push far behind inna readiness fi wave him orders to di helmsman, cast him eager glance inna di direction weh di outstretched motionless arm a Daggoo did indicate aloft.</p>
<p>Weda di flitting attendance a di one still an solitary jet did gradually work pan Ahab, so dat him did now ready fi connect di ideas a mildness an repose wid di first sight a di particular whale weh him did a pursue; however dis was, or weda him eagerness did betray him; whichever way it might been, no sooner did him distinctly perceive di white mass, dan wid a quick intensity him instantly gi orders fi lowering.</p>
<p>Di four boat dem did soon pan di wata; Ahab deh inna front, an all swiftly a pul towards dem prey. Soon it go dung, an while, wid oars suspended, we did a wait it reappearance, lo! inna di same spot weh it did sink, once more it slowly rise. Almost forget fi di moment all thoughts a Moby Dick, we now gazed at di most wondrous phenomenon weh di secret seas dem have hitherto reveal to mankind. A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length an breadth, a glancing cream-colour, lay floating pan di wata, innumerable long arms radiating fram it centre, an curling an twisting like a nest a anaconda, as if blindly fi clutch at any hapless object widin reach. No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token a either sensation or instinct; but undulated deh pan di billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition a life.</p>
<p>As wid a low sucking sound it slowly disappear again, Starbuck still gazing at di agitated waters weh it did sunk, wid a wild voice exclaimed—“Almost rather had mi seen Moby Dick an fight him, dan to have seen you, thou white ghost!”</p>
<p>“Weh it was, Sir?” Flask seh.</p>
<p>“Di great live squid, weh, dem seh, few whale-ships eva beheld, an go back to dem ports fi tell bout it.”</p>
<p>Bot Ehab neva se notn; ton him boat, him sail back to di vessel; di rest as silently following.</p>
<p>Wateva superstitions di sperm whalemen in general have connected wid di sight a dis object, certain it is, dat a glimpse a it being so very unusual, dat circumstance don gone far fi invest it wid portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, dat though one an all a dem declare it to be di largest animated ting inna di ocean, yet very few a dem have any but di most vague ideas concerning its true nature an form; notwithstanding, dem believe it fi furnish to di sperm whale him only food. For though ada species a whale find dem food above water, an may be seen by man inna di act a feeding, di spermaceti whale get him whole food inna unknown zones below di surface; an only by inference is it dat any one can tell of weh, precisely, dat food consist. Somtaim, wen yuh pursue im closely, im wi disgorge weh dem suppose to be di detached arms a di squid; some a dem did a exhibit exceeding twenty an thirty feet inna length. Dem fancy seh di monster weh dem arms yah belong to ordinarily clings by dem to di bed a di ocean; an dat di sperm whale, unlike ada species, get supply wid teet fi attack an tear it.</p>
<p>It look like some ground fi imagine seh di great Kraken a Bishop Pontoppodan maita ultimately resolve itself inna Squid. Di manner in which di Bishop describe it, as alternately rising an sinking, wid some other particulars him narrate, in all dis di two correspond. But much abatement is necessary wid respect to di incredible bulk weh him assign it.</p>
<p>By some naturalists who have vaguely hear rumors of di mysterious creature, weh wi a talk bout yah, it is included among di class a cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it woulda seem fi belong, but only as di Anak a di tribe.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00065">CHAPTER 60. Di Line.</h2>
<p>Wid reference to di whaling scene shortly fi be described, as well as fi di better understanding a all similar scenes elsewhere present, mi have yah fi speak bout di magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.</p>
<p>Di line weh dem did use inna di fishery was a di bes hemp, slightly vapored wid tar, not impregnated wid it, as inna di case a ordinary ropes; fi while tar, as ordinarily used, mek di hemp more pliable to di rope-maker, an also renders di rope itself more convenient to di sailor fi common ship use; yet, not only woulda di ordinary quantity too much stiffen di whale-line fi di close coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen a staat laan, tar in general by no means add to di rope's durability or strength, however much it may gi it compactness an gloss.</p>
<p>A late years di Manilla rope have inna di American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material fi whale-lines; fi, though it no so durable as hemp, it stronger, an far more soft an elastic; an mi ago add (since deh have an æsthetics inna all tings), is much more handsome an becoming to di boat, dan hemp. Hemp a one dusky, dark fellow, a sort a Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian fi behold.</p>
<p>Di whale-line is only two-thirds a one inch inna thickness. At first sight, yuh wouldn't tink it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one an fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred an twenty pounds; so dat di whole rope ago bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, di common sperm whale-line measure someting ova two hundred fathoms. Towards di stern a di boat it spirally coiled weh inna di tub, not like di worm-pipe a one still though, but so as fi form one round, cheese-shaped mass a densely bedded “sheaves,” or layers a concentric spiralizations, widout any hollow but di “heart,” or minute vertical tube form at di axis a di cheese. As di least tangle or kink inna di coiling woulda, inna running out, infallibly tek somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, di utmost precaution is used inna stowing di line inna it tub. Some harpooneers ago consume almost a entire morning inna dis business, carrying di line high aloft an den reeving it dung through a block towards di tub, so as inna di act a coiling fi free it fram all possible wrinkles an twists.</p>
<p>Ina di Ingglish buot dem yuuz tuu tub insted a wan; di same line being continuously coiled inna both tubs. Som advantage deh inna dis; cause dem twin-tubs yah so small dem fit more readily inna di boat, an dem nuh strain it so much; whereas, di American tub, nearly three feet inna diameter an a proportionate depth, mek a rather bulky freight fi a craft weh planks dem a but one half-inch inna thickness; fi di bottom a di whale-boat is like critical ice, weh ago bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much a concentrated one. Wen di painted canvas cover clap pan di American line-tub, di boat look like it did a pull off wid a prodigious great wedding-cake fi present to di whales.</p>
<p>Both ends a di line dem expose; di lower end terminating inna an eye-splice or loop coming up fram di bottom against di side a di tub, an hanging ova it edge completely disengaged fram everyting. Dis arrangement a di lower end is necessary pan two accounts. Fos: Fi mek it iizi fi fasten tu it a wan ada lain fram wan neighboring boat, in kies di stricken whale shuda soun so diip az fi threaten fi carry aaf di entire line weh did orijinali attach tu di harpoon. Inna dem instances yah, di whale of course shift like a mug a ale, as it were, fram di one boat to di other; though di first boat always hover at han fi assist it consort. Sekant: Dis arrangement is indispensable fi common safety's sake; fi if di lower end a di line in any way attached to di boat, an if di whale den did a run di line out to di end almost inna a single, smoking minute as him sometimes do, him wouldn't stop deh, fi di doomed boat woulda infallibly be drag dung afta him inna di profundity a di sea; an inna dat deh case no town-crier woulda eva find har again.</p>
<p>Bifuo yuh lower di boat fi di chase, di upper end a di line tek aft fram di tub, an pass round di loggerhead deh, is again carry forward di entire length a di boat, resting crosswise upon di loom or handle a every man's oar, so dat it jogs against him wrist inna rowing; an also passing between di man dem, as dem alternately sit at di opposite gunwales, to di leaded chocks or grooves inna di extreme pointed prow a di boat, weh a wooden pin or skewer di size a one common quill, prevent it fram slip out. Fram di chocks it hang inna a slight festoon ova di bows, an den it pass inside di boat again; an some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon di box inna di bows, it continue it way to di gunwale still a likkle further aft, an is den attached to di short-warp—di rope weh immediately connect wid di harpoon; but before dat deh connexion, di short-warp go chuu sundry mystifications too tedious fi detail.</p>
<p>So di whale-line fold di whole boat inna it complicated coils, twisting an writhing roun it inna almost every direction. All di oarsmen dem involve inna it perilous contortions; so dat to di timid eye a di landsman, dem seem as Indian jugglers, wid di deadliest snakes sportively festooning dem limbs. Nor can any son a mortal woman, fi di first time, seat himself amid dem hempen intricacies, an while straining him utmost at di oar, betthink him seh at any unknown instant di harpoon may be darted, an all dem horrible contortions may be put in play like ringed lightnings; him cyaan be so circumstanced widout a shudder weh mek di very marrow inna him bones fi quiver inna him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange ting! weh habit can't accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, an brighter repartees, yuh neva hear ova yuh mahogany, dan yuh woulda hear ova di half-inch white cedar a di whale-boat, wen so hung inna hangman's nooses; an, like di six burgers a Calais before King Edward, di six man dem weh did a compose di crew pull inna di jaws a death, wid a halter roun every neck, as yuh may seh.</p>
<p>Miebi a very likkle thought wi now mek yuh can account fi dem repeated whaling disasters—some few a dem casually chronicled—a dis man or dat deh man weh get tek outa di boat by di line, an lost. For, wen di line a dart out, fi be seated den inna di boat, is like being seated inna di midst a di manifold whizzings a one steam-engine inna full play, wen every flying beam, an shaft, an wheel, a graze yuh. It worse; kaa yuh cyaan sit motionless inna di heart a dem perils yah, cause di boat a rock like a cradle, an yuh a pitch one way an di ada, widout di slightest warning; an only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy an simultaneousness a volition an action, yuh can escape being mek a Mazeppa of, an run weh wid weh di all-seeing sun himself coulda neva pierce yuh out.</p>
<p>Again: as di profound calm weh only apparently precede an prophesies a di storm, is perhaps more awful dan di storm itself; fi, indeed, di calm a jus di wrapper an envelope a di storm; an contain it inna itself, as di seemingly harmless rifle hold di fatal powder, an di ball, an di explosion; so di graceful repose a di line, as it silently serpentines bout di oarsmen dem before dem bring it inna actual play—dis a one ting weh carry more a true terror dan any ada aspect a dis dangerous affair. But why yuh seh more? All man live enveloped inna whale-lines. All a dem born wid halters roun dem neck; but it is only wen dem ketch dem inna di swift, sudden turn a death, dat mortals realize di silent, subtle, ever-present perils a life. An if yuh a philosopher, though yuh did a sidong inna di whale-boat, yuh wouldn't feel one whit more a terror, dan if yuh did a sidong before yuh evening fire wid a poker, an not a harpoon, by yuh side.</p>
