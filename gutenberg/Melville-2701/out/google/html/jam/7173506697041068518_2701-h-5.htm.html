<h2 id="pgepubid00027">CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.</h2>
<p>At length, towards noon, upon di final dismissal a di ship's riggers, an afta di Pequod did get haul out fram di wharf, an afta di ever-thoughtful Charity did come off inna a whale-boat, wid har last gift—a night-cap fi Stubb, di secan mate, har bredda-in-law, an a spareaf fi all di Bible, Peleg an Bildad, kom outa di cabin, an ton tu di chief mate, Peleg se:</p>
<p>“Now, Mr. Starbuck, yuh sure everyting right? Captain Ahab all ready—jus talk to him—notn more fi get fram shore, eh? Well, call all hands, den. Muster 'em aft yah—blast 'em!”</p>
<p>“No need a profane words, how great di hurry, Peleg,” seh Bildad, “but weh wid yuh, fren Starbuck, an do wi bidding.”</p>
<p>How now! Yahso pan di very point a staatin fi di voyage, Captain Peleg an Captain Bildad did a go it wid a high han pan di quarter-deck, jos laik if dem did a go bi joint-commander dem at sea, az wel az tu aal apierans dem inna port. An, as fi Captain Ahab, no sign a him neva deh yet; only, dem seh him did deh inna di cabin. But den, di idea was, dat him presence was by no means necessary in getting di ship unda weigh, an steering har well out to sea. Indeed, as dat neva at all him proper business, but di pilot's; an as him neva yet completely recover—so dem seh—so, Captain Ahab stay below. An all a dis did look natural enough; especially as inna di merchant service plenty captains neva show demself pan deck fi a considerable time afta dem heave up di anchor, but dem stay ova di cabin table, having a farewell merry-making wid dem shore fren dem, before dem quit di ship fi good wid di pilot.</p>
<p>But it neva have much chance fi tink ova di matter, cause Captain Peleg did all alive now. Im did look like im did a do most a di talking an commanding, an not Bildad.</p>
<p>“Aft yah, unu sons a bachelors,” him baal out, as di sailors dem did a linger at di main-mast. “Mista Starbuck, drive 'em aft.”</p>
<p>“Strike di tent deh!”—a did di next order. As mi did hint before, dis whalebone marquee neva pitch except inna port; an pan di Pequod, fi thirty years, di order fi strike di tent did well known fi be di next ting fi heaving up di anchor.</p>
<p>“Man di capstan! Blood an thunder!—jump!”—a did di neks command, an di crew sprang fi di handspikes.</p>
<p>Now in getting under weigh, di station weh di pilot generally occupied is di forward part a di ship. An yahso Bildad, weh, wid Peleg, be it known, in addition to him ada officers, was one a di licensed pilots a di port—im being suspected fi get himself mek a pilot in order fi save di Nantucket pilot-fee to all di ships dem weh him did concern inna, fi him neva pilot no ada craft—Bildad, mi seh, might now be seenly engaged inna di bows fi di bows approaching anchor, an at intervals singing weh did look like a dismal stave a psalmody, fi cheer di hands dem at di windlass, weh did a roar out some sort a chorus bout di girls dem inna Booble Alley, wid hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three days before, Bildad did tell dem seh no profane songs woulda be allowed on board di Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; an Charity, him sista, did put a likkle choice copy a Watts inna each seaman's berth.</p>
<p>Meantime, overseeing di ada part a di ship, Captain Peleg rip an swore astern inna di most frightful manner. Mi almost did tink seh him woulda sink di ship before di anchor coulda get up; involuntarily mi pause pan mi handspike, an tell Queequeg fi do di same ting, tinkin bout di perils we both did a run, inna staatin pan di voyage wid such a devil fi a pilot. Mi did a comfort miself, however, wid di thought seh inna pious Bildad coulda find some salvation, spite a him seven hundred an seventy-seventh lay; wen mi feel a sudden sharp poke inna mi rear, an turning round, mi did horrified at di apparition a Captain Peleg inna di act a tek weh him leg fram mi immediate vicinity. Dat was mi first kick.</p>
<p>“A so dem heave inna di marchant service?” him roar. “Spring, yuh sheep-head; spring, an break yuh backbone! Why yuh nuh spring, mi seh, all a yuh—spring! Quohog! spring, yuh chap wid di red whiskers; spring deh, Scotch-cap; spring, yuh green pants. Spring, mi seh, all a yuh, an spring yuh eyes out!” An so seh, him move along di windlass, yah an deh a use him leg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kip aan a lead off wid him psalmody. Mi tink, Captain Peleg mus did a drink someting to-day.</p>
<p>At last di anchor did up, di sails did set, an off we glide. A did a shaat, cold Christmas; an as di shaat northern day did a merge inna night, wi did find wiself almost broad pan di wintry ocean, weh freezing spray did a case wi inna ice, as inna polished armor. Di lang rows a teet dem pan di bulwark dem did a glisten inna di moonlight; an like di white ivory tusks a some huge elephant, vast curving icicles did depend fram di bows.</p>
<p>Lank Bildad, as pilot, did a head di first watch, an ever an anon, as di old craft deep dive inna di green seas, an sen di shivering frost all ova har, an di winds did a howle, an di cordage did a ring, him steady notes did a hear,—</p>
<div class="pgmonospaced">      <i>“Sweet fields beyond di swelling flood,<br/> Staan dress inna living green.<br/> So to di Jews old Canaan did stan,<br/> While Jordan did a roll between.”</i></div>
<p>Neva did dem sweet words deh sound more sweetly to mi dan den. Dem did full a hope an fruition. Spite a dis frigid winta night inna di boisterous Atlantic, spite a mi wet feet an wetter jacket, deh did have yet, it den seem to mi, plenty a pleasant haven inna store; an meads an glades so eternally vernal, dat di grass shot up by di spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.</p>
<p>At last we gain such an offing, dat di two pilots dem neva need no more. Di stout sail-boat weh did a come wid wi staat range alongside.</p>
<p>It was curious an not unpleasing, how Peleg an Bildad did get affect at dis juncture, especially Captain Bildad. Fi loath fi depart, yet; very loath fi lef, fi good, a ship bound pan so long an perilous a voyage—beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands a him hard earned dollars did invest; a ship, in which a old shipmate sail as captain; a man almost as old as him, once more staatin fi encounter all di terrors a di pitiless jaw; loath fi seh good-bye to a ting so every way brimful a every interest to him,—poor old Bildad lingered long; paced di deck wid anxious strides; run dung inna di cabin fi speak anodda farewell word deh; again come pan deck, an look to windward; look towards di wide an endless waters, only bounded by di far-off unseen Eastern Continents; look towards di lan; look op; look right an left; look everyweh an noweh; an at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon it pin, convulsively grab stout Peleg by di han, an holding up a lantern, fi a moment stan up gazing heroically inna him face, as much as to seh, “Nevertheless, fren Peleg, mi can stan it; yes, mi can.”</p>
<p>As fi Peleg himself, him tek it more like a philosopher; but fi all him philosophy, deh did have a tear twinkling inna him eye, wen di lantern come too near. An him, too, neva a likkle run fram cabin to deck—now a word below, an now a word wid Starbuck, di chief mate.</p>
<p>But, at last, him turn to him comrade, wid a final sort a look bout him,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we haffi go. Back di main-yard deh! Boat ahoy! Stand by fi come close alongside, now! Careful, careful!—come, Bildad, boy—say yuh last. Luck to yebuck, Starbuck—to Mrluck—to Mrluckb. yuh, Mr. Flask—good-bye an good luck to yuh all—an dis day three years mi ago have a hot supper smoking fi yuh inna old Nantucket an away!”</p>
<p>“God bless yuh, an have yuh inna Him holy keeping, man,” murmured old Bildad, almost incoherently. “Mi hope yuh wi have good weather now, so dat Captain Ahab may soon be moving mongst yuh—a pleasant sun is all him need, an yuh wi have plenty a dem inna di tropic voyage yuh go. Be careful inna di hunt, yuh mates. Don't stave di boats needlessly, yuh harpooneers; good white cedar plank is fulled fi each year. forget yuh prayers, either. Stubb; it did a likkle bit, Mr. Flask, beware a fornication, Mr. Starbuck it ago spoil.</p>
<p>“Kom, kom, Kaptan Bildad, stap taak, —we!” an wid dat, Peleg hurry him ova di side, an both drop inna di boat.</p>
<p>Ship an boat diverged; di cold, damp night breeze did a bluo between; a screamining gull fly ovahead; di two hulls dem wildly roll; wi gi three heavy-hearted cheers, an blindly plunge like fate inna di lone Atlantic.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00028">CHAPTER 23. Di Lee Shore.</h2>
<p>Some chapters back, one Bulkington did a taak bout, a tall, newlanded mariner, weh dem did encounter inna New Bedford at di inn.</p>
<p>Wen pan dat deh shivering winta's night, di Pequod thrust har vindictive bows inna di cold malicious waves, who shuda mi see standing at har helm but Bulkington! Mi look wid sympathetic awe an fearfulness pan di man, weh inna mid-winter jus land fram a four years' dangerous voyage, coulda so unrestingly push off again fi still anodda tempestuous term. Di lan did look laik it did a bon op tu im fut dem. Wonderfullest tings are ever di unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; dis six-inch chapter a di stoneless grave a Bulkington. Mek mi only seh dat it did fare wid him as wid di storm-tossed ship, weh miserably drive along di leeward lan. Di port woulda fain gi succor; di port is pitiful; inna di port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, frens, all dat's kind to wi mortalities. But inna dat deh gale, di port, di lan, a dat deh ship's direst jeopardy; she haffi fly all hospitality; one touch a lan, though it but graze di keel, woulda mek har shiek chruu an chruu. Wid all har power she crowd all sail off shore; inna so doing, fights 'gainst di very winds weh fain woulda blow har homeward; seeks all di lashed sea's landlessness again; fi refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; har only fren har bitterest foe!</p>
<p>Yuh know now, Bulkington? Glimpses do yuh seem fi see a dat deh mortally intolerable truth; dat all deep, earnest tinkin is only di intrepid effort a di soul fi keep di open independence a har sea; while di wildest winds a heaven an earth conspire fi cast har pan di treacherous, slavish shore?</p>
<p>But as inna landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God—so, better is it fi perish inna dat deh howling infinite, dan be ingloriously dashed upon di lee, even if dat was safety! Fi worm-like, den, oh! who woulda craven crawl to land! Terrors a di terrible! all dis agony so vain? Tek heart, tek heart, O Bulkington! Bear yuh grimly, demigod! Up fram di spray a yuh ocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00029">CHAPTER 24. Di Advocate.</h2>
<p>As Queequeg an mi a now fairly embarked inna dis business a whaling; an as dis business a whaling somehow come fi be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical an disreputable pursuit; so, mi a all anxiety fi convince yuh, yuh landsmen, a di injustice weh dem do to wi hunters a whales.</p>
<p>Inna di fos plies, it maita bi diim almuos superfluous fi establish di fak, se mongx piipl at laaj, di bizniz a whaling no akount pan a lebl wid wa dem kaal di libaral profeshan dem. If a stranger did get introduce inna any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it woulda but slightly advance di general opinion a him merits, if him did present to di company as a harpooneer, say; an if in emulation a di naval officers him shuda append di initials SWF (Sperm Whale Fishery) to him visiting card, such a procedure woulda be deemed pre-eminently presuming an ridiculous.</p>
<p>Doubtless one leading reason why di world decline honoring wi whalemen, is dis: dem tink seh, at best, wi vocation amount to a butchering sort a business; an dat wen wi actively engaged inna it, wi deh surrounded by all manner a defilements. Butchers we is, dat is true. But butchers, also, an butchers of di bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom di world invariably delights to honor. An as fi di matter a di alleged uncleanliness a wi business, yuh shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, an which, upon di whole, will triumphantly plant di sperm whale-ship at least among di cleanliest tings a dis tidy earth. But even granting di charge in question fi be true; weh disordered slippery decks a one whale-ship dem comparable to di unspeakable carrion a dem battle-fields fram weh so many soldiers return fi drink inna all ladies's plaudits? An if di idea a peril so much enhance di popular conceit a di soldier's profession; mek mi assure yuh seh plenty a veteran weh freely march up to a battery, woulda quickly recoil at di apparition a di sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into eddies di air ova him head. For weh a di comprehensible terrors a man compared wid di interlinked terrors an wonders a God!</p>
<p>But, though di world scouts at wi whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! fi almost all di tapers, lamps, an candles dem weh burn roun di globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!</p>
<p>But look pon dis matter inna ada lights; wiet pan it iina aal kain a skiel; si weh wi whalemen dem is, an been.</p>
<p>Wa mek di Dutch dem inna De Witt's time did have admirals a dem whaling fleets? Wa mek Louis XVI. a France, at him own personal expense, fit out whaling ships fram Dunkirk, an politely invite to dat deh town some score or two a families fram wi own island a Nantucket? Wa mek Britain between di years 1750 an 1788 pay to har whalemen inna bounties upwards a £1,000,000? An lastly, how it come dat wi whalemen a America now outnumber all di rest a di banded whalemen dem inna di worl; sail a navy a upwards a seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand man; yearly consuming 4,000,000 a dollars; di ship dem worth, at di time a sailing, $20,000,000! an every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How come all dis, if deh nuh have someting puissant inna whaling?</p>
<p>But dis a nuh di half; luk agen.</p>
<p>Mi freely assert, dat di cosmopolite philosopher cyaan, fi him life, point out one single peaceful influence, weh widin di last sixty years have operated more potentially upon di whole broad world, tek in one aggregate, dan di high an mighty business a whaling. One way an anodda, it have begotten events so remarkable inna demself, an so continuously momentous inna dem sequential issues, dat whaling may well be regarded as dat Egyptian mother, who bore offspring demself pregnant fram har womb. It woulda be a hopeless, endless task fi catalog all dem ting deh. Mek a handful suffice. Fi many years past di whale-ship a di pioneer inna ferreting out di remotest an least known parts a di earth. Shi don explore seas an archipelagoes weh neva have no chart, weh no Cook or Vancouver neva eva sail. If American an European man-of-war now peacefully ride inna once savage harbors, mek dem fire salutes to di honor an glory a di whale-ship, weh originally did show dem di way, an first interpreted between dem an di savages. Dem maita celebrate as dem will di heroes a Exploring Expeditions, yuh Cooks, yuh Krusensterns; but mi seh dat scores a anonymous Captains did sail outa Nantucket, weh did as great, an greater dan yuh Cook an yuh Krusenstern. For inna dem succourless empty-handedness, dem, inna di heathenish sharked waters, an by di beaches a unrecorded, javelin islands, battled wid virgin wonders an terrors weh Cook wid all him marines an muskets wouldn't willingly have dare. All weh mek such a flourish a inna di ole South Sea Voyages, dem deh ting deh was but di life-time commonplaces a wi heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures weh Vancouver dedicate three chapters to, dem man yah accounted unworthy fi be set dung inna di ship's common log. Ah, di worl! Oh, di worl!</p>
<p>Til di whale fishery roun Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial, scarcely any intercourse but colonial, did a gwaan between Europe an di long line a di opulent Spanish provinces dem pan di Pacific coast. A di whaleman weh fos break thru di jealous policy a di Spanish crown, touching dem deh colonies deh; an, if space permit, it might be distinctly shown how fram dem deh whalemen at last eventuated di liberation a Peru, Chili, an Bolivia fram di yoke a Old Spain, an di establishment a di eternal democracy inna dem deh parts.</p>
<p>Dat deh great America pan di ada side a di sphere, Australia, did gi di enlightened worl by di whaleman. Afta it fos blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all ada ships lang shun dem shores as pestiferously barbarous; but di whale-ship touch deh. Di whale-ship a di true mada a dat deh now mighty colony. Moreover, inna di infancy a di fos Australian settlement, di emigrants dem did get save fram starvation by di benevolent biscuit a di whale-ship luckily drop an anchor inna dem waters. Di uncounted isles a all Polynesia confess di same truth, an do commercial homage to di whale-ship, weh clear di way fi di missionary an di merchant, an inna many cases carry di primitive missionaries to dem first destinations. If dat deh double-bolted lan, Japan, eva a go become hospitable, a di whale-ship alone to whom di credit ago be due; fi already she deh pan di threshold.</p>
<p>But if, inna di face a all dis, yuh still declare seh whaling have no æsthetically noble associations connected wid it, den am mi ready fi shiver fifty lances wid yuh deh, an unhorse yuh wid a split helmet every time.</p>
<p>Di whale no have no famous author, an whale no famous chronicler, yuh wi seh.</p>
<p><i>Di whale no famous author, an whaling no famous chronicler?</i> A uu rait di fos akount bout wi Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! An who did compose di first narrative a one whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince dan Alfred di Great, who, wid him own royal pen, tek dung di wod dem fram Other, di Norwegian whale-hunter a dem time deh! An who pronounce fi wi glowing eulogy inna Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!</p>
<p>True enough, but den whalemen demself a poor devils; dem no have no good blood inna dem veins.</p>
<p><i>No good blood inna dem veins?</i> Dem have someting betta dan royal blood deh. Di granny a Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; aftawod, bai marij, Mary Folger, wan a di uol sekla dem a Nantucket, an di ancestress tu wan lang lain a Folgers an harpooneers—aal kith an kin tu noble Benjamin—dis die a dart di barbed iron fram wan saida di worl tu di ada.</p>
<p>Good again; but den all confess seh somehow whaling is not respectable.</p>
<p><i>Whaling not respectable?</i> Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory law, di whale is declared “a royal fish.” *</p>
<p>Oh, dat a only nominal! Di whale himself neva figure inna no grand imposing way.</p>
<p><i>Di whale neva figure inna no grand imposing way?</i> Inna one a di mighty triumphs dem weh dem did gi to a Roman general wen him did a enter di world's capital, di bones a one whale, weh dem did bring all di way fram di Syrian coast, was di most conspicuous object inna di cymballed procession.*</p>
<p>*Si di neks chapta dem fi somting muor pan dis ya ed.</p>
<p>Grant it, since yuh cite it; but, seh weh yuh waan, no real dignity nuh deh inna whaling.</p>
<p><i>No dignity inna whaling?</i> Di dignity a wi calling di very heavens attest. Cetus a one constellation inna di South! No more! Drive dung yuh hat inna di Czar, an tek it off to Queequeg! No more! Mi know a man weh, inna him lifetime, tek three hundred an fifty whales. Mi consider dat deh man deh more honorable dan dat deh great captain a antiquity weh did a boast a tek as many walled towns.</p>
<p>An, as fi mi, if, by any possibility, deh deh any as yet undiscovered prime ting inna mi; if mi eva deserve any real repute inna dat deh small but high hushed world weh mi might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if afta dis mi a go do anyting weh, pan di whole, a man woulda radda did do dan fi did lef undone; if, at mi death, mi executors, or more properly mi creditors, find any precious MSS. inna mi desk, den yahso mi prospectively ascribe all di honor an di glory to whaling; fi a whale-ship was mi Yale College an mi Harvard.</p>

<p>In behalf a di dignity a whaling, mi woulda fain advance naught but substantiated facts. But afta im embattling him facts, an advocate weh shuda wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, weh might tell eloquently upon him cause—such an advocate, wouldn't him be blameworthy?</p>
<p>It is well known dat at di coronation a kings an queens, even modern ones, a certain curious process a seasoning dem fi dem functions gone through. Deh have a saltcellar of state, so called, an deh may have a castor of state. How dem use di salt, precisely—who knows? Certain mi am, however, dat a king's head is solemnly oiled at him coronation, even as a head of salad. It can be, though, dat dem anoint it wid a view fi mek it interior run well, as dem anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated yah, concerning di essential dignity a dis regal process, cause inna common life we ​​esteem but meanly an contemptibly a fellow weh anoint him hair, an palpably smell a dat deh anointing. In truth, a mature man weh use hair-oil, unless medicinally, dat deh man probably have a quoggy spot inna him somweh. As a general rule, him cyaan amount to much inna him totality.</p>
<p>But di only ting fi consider yah, is dis—weh kain a oil dem use at coronations? Certainly it cyaan be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. Weh den it can possibly be, but sperm oil inna it unmanufactured, unpolluted state, di sweetest a all oils?</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00031">CHAPTER 26. Knights an Squires.</h2>
<p>Di chief mate a di Pequod was Starbuck, a native a Nantucket, an a Quaker by descent. Im was a long, earnest man, an though im did born pan a icy coast, im did look well adapted fi endure hot latitudes, im flesh did aad as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to di Indies, him live blood wouldn't spoil like bottled ale. Im mus did born inna some time a general drought an famine, or pan one a dem fast days deh weh im state famous fi. Only some thirty arid summers him did see; dem deh summer deh did dry up all him physical superfluousness. But dis, him thinness, so fi seh, did look no more di token a wasting anxieties an cares, dan it did look like di indication a any bodily blight. A did jus di condensation a di man. Him neva did no ill-looking; quite di contrary. Him pure tight skin was an excellent fit; an closely wrap up inna it, an embalmed wid inner health an strength, like a revivified Egyptian, dis Starbuck did look ready fi endure fi long ages to come, an fi endure always, as now; fi be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, him interior vitality was warranted fi do well inna all climates. Wen yuh look inna him eyes, yuh did a see deh di yet lingering images a dem thousand-fold perils weh him did calmly confront through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life fi di most part was a telling pantomime of action, an not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, fi all him hardy sobriety an fortitude, deh did have certain qualities inna him weh at times did affect, an inna some cases did look well nigh fi overbalance all di rest. Uncommonly conscientious fi a seaman, an endued wid a deep natural reverence, di wild watery loneliness a him life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to dat deh sort a superstition, weh inna some organizations seems radda fi spring, somehow, fram intelligence dan fram ignorance. Outward portents an inward presentiments was him. An if at times dem ting deh bent di welded iron a him soul, much more did him far-away domestic memories a him young Cape wife an pickney, tend fi bend him still more fram di original ruggedness a him nature, an open him still further to dem latent influences weh, inna some honest-hearted man, restrain di gush a dare-devil, soten evil perceded by di others vicissitudes a di fishery. “Mi naa go have no man inna mi boat,” Starbuck seh, “we no fraid a whale.” By dis, him did a mean, not only dat di most reliable an useful courage was dat weh arise fram di fair estimation a di encountered peril, but dat an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade dan a coward.</p>
<p>“Aye, aye,” Stubb, di secan mate, seh, “Starbuck, deh, is as careful a man as yuh wi find anywhere inna dis fishery.” But wi shall ere long see weh dat deh word “careful” precisely mean wen yuh use it by a man like Stubb, or almost any ada whale hunter.</p>
<p>Starbuck was no crusader afta perils; inna him courage neva a sentiment; but a ting simply useful to him, an always at han pan all mortally practical occasions. Besides, him did tink, perhaps, seh inna dis business a whaling, courage was one a di great staple outfits a di ship, like har beef an har bread, an not fi be foolishly wasted. So him neva have no fancy fi lower fi whales afta sun-down; nor fi persist inna fighting a fish weh too much persist inna fighting him. For, did tink Starbuck, mi deh yah inna dis critical ocean fi kill whales fi mi living, an not fi get kill by dem fi dem own; an dat hundreds a man did get kill so Starbuck did know. Weh doom was him own fadda's? Weh, inna di bottomless deeps, him coulda find di torn limbs a him bredda?</p>
<p>Wid memories like dem inna him, an, moreover, given to a certain superstitiousness, as dem seh; di courage a dis Starbuck weh coulda, nevertheless, still flourish, mus indeed did extreme. But it neva inna reasonable nature dat a man so organized, an wid such terrible experiences an remembrances as him did have; it neva inna nature dat dem ting deh shuda fail inna latently engendering an element inna him, weh, unda suitable circumstances, woulda break out fram it confinement, an burn up all him courage. An brave as him might be, it was dat deh sort a bravery chiefly, visible inna some intrepid man, weh, while generally abiding firm inna di conflict wid seas, or winds, or whales, or any a di ordinary irrational horrors a di worl, yet cyaan withstand dem deh more terrific, cause more spiritual terrors, weh sometimes menace yuh fram di concentrating brow an enrage many mighta.</p>
<p>But if di coming narrative did a reveal in any instance, di complete abasement a poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might mi have di heart fi write it; fi it a ting weh most sorrowful, nay shocking, fi expose di fall a valor inna di soul. Man maita look detestable as joint stock-companies an nations; knaves, fools, an murderers dem may deh deh; man maita have mean an meager faces; but man, inna di ideal, is so noble an so sparkling, such a grand an glowing creature, dat ova any ignominious blemish inna him all him fellows shuda run fi throw dem costliest robes. Dat deh immaculate manliness we feel widin wiself, so far widin wi, dat it remain intact though all di outer character seem gone; bleed wid keenest anguish at di undraped spectacle a one valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle har upbraidings against di permitting stars. But dis august dignity weh mi a treat a, a nuh di dignity a kings an robes, but dat abunding dignity weh nuh have no robed investiture. Yuh wi si it shine inna di arm weh wield a pick or drive a spike; dat deh democratic dignity weh, pan all hands, radiate widout end fram God; Himself! Di great God absolute! Di center an circumference a all democracy! Him omnipresence, wi divine equality!</p>
<p>If, den, to meanest mariners, an renegades an castaways, mi shall hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round dem tragic graces; if even di most mournful, perchance di most abasted, among dem all, shall at times lift himself to di exalted mounts; if mi touch dat deh workman's arm wid some ethereal light; if mi shall spread a rainbow ova him disastrous set a sun; den gens all mortal critics bear mi out inna it, yuh jus Spirit a Equality, weh spread one royal mantle a humanity ova all mi kind! Bear mi out inna it, yuh great democratic God! who didn't refuse to di swart convict, Bunyan, di pale, poetic pearl; Yuh weh did clothe wid double hammered leaves a finest gold, di stumped an paupered arm a old Cervantes; Yuh did pick up Andrew Jackson fram di pebbles; who did thurl him pan a war-horse; who did thunder him higher dan a throne!

<h2 id="pgepubid00032">CHAPTER 27. Knights an Squires.</h2>
<p>Stubb was di secan mate. Im was a native a Cape Cod; an so, according to local usage, dem did call it a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky; no craven nor valiant; tek perils as dem come wid an indifferent air; an while engaged inna di most imminent crisis a di chase, toiling away, calm an collected as a journeyman joiner engaged fi di year. Good-humored, easy, an careless, him preside ova him whale-boat as if di most deadly encounter was but a dinner, an him crew all invited guests. Im did as particular bout di comfortable arrangement a im part a di boat, as an old stage-driver is bout di snugness a im box. Wen him did deh close to di whale, inna di very death-lock a di fight, him handle him unpitying lance coolly an off-handedly, as a whistling tinker him hammer. Im woulda hum ova im old rigadig tunes while flank an flank wid di most exasperated monster. Long usage did, fi dis Stubb, convert di jaws a death inna an easy chair. Weh him did tink bout death itself, yuh can tell. Weda him eva tink bout it at all, might be a question; but, if him eva did chance fi cast him mind dat way afta a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, him tek it fi be a sort a call a di watch fi tumble aloft, an bestir demself deh, bout someting weh him woulda find out wen him obeye di order, an not sooner.</p>
<p>Weh, perhaps, wid ada tings, mek Stubb such a easy-going, unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off wid di burden a life inna a worl full a grave pedlars, all bow to di ground wid dem packs; weh help fi bring bout dat almost impious good-humor a him; dat ting mosi did a him pipe. For, like him nose, him short, black likkle pipe was one a di regular features a him face. Yuh woulda almost as soon did expect him fi turn out a him bunk widout him nose as widout him pipe. Im kip a whole row a pipes deh ready loaded, stick inna a rack, widin easy reach a im han; an, weneva him turn in, him smoke dem all out inna succession, lighting one fram di ada to di end a di chapter; den loading dem again fi be inna readiness anew. For, wen Stubb dress, instead a first put him legs inna him trowsers, him put him pipe inna him mout.</p>
<p>Mi seh dis continual smoking mus been one cause, at least, a him peculiar disposition; fi everybody know seh dis earthly air, weda ashore or a float, is terribly infected wid di nameless miseries a di numberless mortals weh dead exhaling it; an as in time a di cholera, some people go bout wid a camphorated handkerchief to dem mout; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb's tobacco smoke mighta did operate as a sort a disinfecting agent.</p>
<p>Di third mate was Flask, a native a Tisbury, inna Martha's Vineyard. A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow did a tink seh di great leviathans dem did personally an hereditarily afronted him; an so it was a sort a point a honor wid him, fi destroy dem whenever dem encounter dem. So utterly lost was him to all sense a reverence fi di many marvels a dem majestic bulk an mystic ways; an so dead to anyting like an apprehension a any possible danger fram encounter dem; dat inna him poor opinion, di wondrous whale was only a species a magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, weh did need only a likkle circumvention an some likkle application a time an trouble fi kill an boil. Dis ignorant, unconscious fearlessness a him mek him a likkle waggish inna di matter a whales; him did a fala dem fish yah fi di fun a it; an a three years' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke weh last dat deh length a time. As a carpenter's nails dem divide into wrought nails an cut nails; so mankind maita be similarly divided. Little Flask was one a di wrought ones; mek fi clinch tight an last long. Dem call him King-Post pan di Pequod; cause, inna form, him coulda be well likened to di short, square timber weh dem know wid dat deh name inna Arctic whalers; an weh by di means a many radiating side timbers insert inna it, serve fi brace di ship against di icy concussions a dem battering seas deh.</p>
<p>Now dem three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, an Flask, was momentous man. Dem it was who by universal prescription command three a di Pequod's boats as headsmen. Inna dat deh grand order a battle in which Captain Ahab woulda probably marshal him forces fi descend pan di whales, dem three headsman deh was as captains a companies. Or, being armed wid dem long keen whaling spears, dem was as a picked trio a lancers; even as di harpooneers dem did a flingers a javelins.</p>
<p>An since inna dis famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic Knight of old, is always accompany by him boat-steerer or harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provide him wid a fresh lance, wen di fos one get badly twisted, or elbowed inna di assault; an moreover, as deh generally subsists between di two, a close intimacy an friendliness; it is therefore but meet, dat inna dis place we set dung who di Pequod's harpooneers dem was, an to which headsman each a dem belong.</p>
<p>Fos a all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, di chief mate, did pick fi him squire. But Queequeg is already known.</p>
<p>Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian fram Gay Head, di most westerly promontory a Martha's Vineyard, weh still deh deh di last remnant a one village a red man, weh don supply di neighboring island a Nantucket wid plenty a har most daring harpooneers. Inna di fishery, dem usually go by di generic name a Gay-Headers. Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, him high cheek bones, an black rounding eyes—fi an Indian, Oriental inna dem largeness, but Antarctic inna dem glittering expression—all dis sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor a di unvitiated blood a dem proud warrior hunters, who, in quest a di great New England, did aborig, bow inna di han, forests a di main. But no longer snuffing inna di trail a di wild beast dem a di woodland, Tashtego now a hunt inna di wake a di great whales dem a di sea; di unerring harpoon a di son fitly replacing di infallible arrow a di sires. Fi look pan di tawny brawn a him lithe snaky limbs, yuh woulda almost have credited di superstitions a some a di earlier Puritans, an half-belived dis wild Indian fi be a son a di Prince a di Powers of di Air. Tashtego was Stubb di secan mate's squire.</p>
<p>Di third mongst di harpooneers dem was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black negro-savage, wid a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus fi behold. Suspended fram him ears was two golden hoops, so big dat di sailors dem call dem ring-bolts, an woulda talk bout securing di top-sail halyards to dem. Inna him youth Daggoo did voluntarily ship pan board a one whaler, lying inna a lonely bay pan him native coast. An neva having been anywhere inna di worl but inna Africa, Nantucket, an di pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; an afta dem did a lead fi nuff years di bold life a di fishery inna di ship dem a di owna dem weh neva did a heedful a weh manner a man dem did a ship; Daggoo did kip all a him barbaric virtues, an erect as a giraffe, move bout di decks inna all di pomp a six feet five inna him socks. A did a corporeal humility wen yuh look up pan him; an a white man weh did a stan up inna him did look like a white flag come fi beg truce a one fortress. Curious fi tell, dis imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was di Squire of likkle Flask, who look like a chess-man beside him. As fi di residue a di Pequod's company, be it said, dat at di present day not one inna two a di many thousand man dem before di mast employed inna di American whale fishery, a Americans born, though pretty nearly all di officers dem a. Yahso a di siem ting wid di American whale fishery az wid di American army an military an merchant navies, an di engineering forces dem weh dem employ inna di construction a di American Canals an Railroads. Di same ting, mi seh, cause inna all dem case deh di native American liberally provide di brains, di rest a di worl as generously supply di muscles. No likl nomba a dem whaling seamen yah belong to di Azores, weh di outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch fi augment dem crews fram di hardy peasants a dem rocky shores deh. Inna di same manner, di Greenland whalers dem weh did a sail out a Hull or London, put inna di Shetland Islands, fi get di full complement a dem crew. Pan di passage homewards, dem drop dem deh again. How it is, yuh can telling, but Islanders seem fi mek di bes whalemen. Dem was nearly all Islanders inna di Pequod, <i>Isolatoes</i> too, mi call such, not acknowledge di common continent a man, but each <i>Isolato</i> living pan a separate continent a him own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set dem Isolatoes yah was! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation fram all di isles a di sea, an all di ends a di earth, accompanying Old Ahab inna di Pequod fi lay di world's grievances before dat deh bar fram weh not very many a dem eva come back. Black Little Pip—im neva did—oh, no! him did go before. Poor Alabama bwai! Pan di grim Pequod's forecastle, yuh shall ere long si him, a beating him tambourine; prelusive a di eternal time, wen dem sen fi, to di great quarter-deck pan high, him did bid strike in wid angels, an beat him tambourine inna glory; call a coward yah, hail a hero deh!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00033">CHAPTER 28. Ahab.</h2>
<p>Fi several days afta dem lef Nantucket, dem neva si notn above hatches a Captain Ahab. Di mates dem did a relieve each ada at di watch dem, an fi aught weh coulda be seen to di contrary, dem did look like dem did a di only commander dem a di ship; only dem sometimes issued fram di cabin wid orders so sudden an peremptory, dat afta all it was plain dem but command vicariously. Yes, dem supreme lord an dictator did deh deh, though hitherto seen by any eyes not permitted fi penetrate inna di now sacred retreat a di cabin.</p>
<p>Every time mi ascend to di deck fram mi watches below, mi instantly gazed aft fi mark if any strange face did visible; fi mi fos vague disquietude touching di unknown captain, now inna di seclusion a di sea, became almost a perturbation. Dis was strangely heightened at times by di ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to mi, wid a subtle energy mi couldn't have before conceived of. But poorly coulda mi stan dem, much as inna ada moods mi did almost ready fi smile at di solemn whimsicalities a dat deh outlandish prophet a di wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness—fi call it so—which mi did feel, yet whenever mi come fi look bout mi inna di ship, it did look against all warrantory fi cherish such emotions. For though di harpooneers, wid di great body a di crew, was a far more barbaric, heathenish, an motley set dan any a di tame merchant-ship companies weh mi previous experiences did mek mi acquainted wid, still mi ascribe dis—an rightly ascribe it—to di fierce uniqueness a di very nature a dat deh wild Scandinavition weh Imbarked so embarked. But it was especially di aspect a di three chief officers a di ship, di mates, weh did most forcibly calculated fi allay dem colorless misgivings, an induce confidence an cheerfulness inna every presentment a di voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers an man, each inna dem own different way, couldn't readily be found, an dem was every one a dem Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas wen di ship shot fram out har harbor, fi a space we did have biting Polar weather, though all di time running weh fram it to di southward; an by every degree an minute a latitude weh we sail, gradually lef dat deh merciless winta, an all it intolerable weather behind wi. It was one a dem less lowering, but still gray an gloomy enough mornings a di transition, wen wid a fair wind di ship did a rush thru di wata wid a vindictive sort a leaping an melancholy rapidity, dat as mi mount to di deck at di call a di forenoon watch, so soon as mi level mi glance towards di tabora, run ova mi shivers. Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab did a stan up pan him quarter-deck.</p>
<p>It neva look like no sign a common bodily illness bout him, nor a di recovery fram any. Im look like a man cut weh fram di stake, wen di fire did a overrunningly waste all di limbs widout consuming dem, or tek weh one particle fram dem compacted aged robustness. Him whole high, broad form, did look like it mek outa solid bronze, an did shape inna one mould weh yuh couldn't change, like Cellini's cast Perseus. Threading it way out fram mongst him gray hairs, an continuing right dung one side a him tawny scorched face an neck, til it disappear inna him clothing, yuh si a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It did look like dat perpendicular seam weh sometimes mek inna di straight, lofty trunk a one great tree, wen di upper lightning tearingly darts dung it, an widout wrenching a single twig, peel an groove out di bark fram top to bottom, ere running off inna di soil, lef di tree still greenly alive, but branded. Weda dat deh mark did born wid him, or weda it was di scar weh some desperate wound did lef, nobadi coulda certainly seh. By some tacit consent, throughout di voyage likkle or no allusion did mek to it, especially by di mates. But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head Indian mongst di crew, superstitiously asserted dat not til him did full forty years old did Ahab become dat way branded, an den it come upon him, not inna di fury a any mortal fray, but inna an elemental strife at sea. Yet, dis wild hint did look inferentially negatived, by weh a gray Manxman did insinuate, an old sepulchral man, who, having neva before sail out a Nantucket, neva did ere dis laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, di old sea-traditions, di immemorial credulities, popularly invest dis old Manxman wid preternatural powers of discernment. So dat no white sailor seriously contradict him wen him seh dat if eva Captain Ahab shuda be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to pass, so him muttered—den, whoever shuda do dat deh last office fi di dead, woulda find a birth-mark pan him fram crown to sole.</p>
<p>So powerfully did di whole grim aspect a Ahab affect mi, an di livid brand weh streak it, dat fi di first few moments mi hardly note seh not a likkle a dis overbearing grimness was owing to di barbaric white leg upon which him partly did a stan op. It did come to mi before seh dis ivory leg did at sea did fashion fram di polished bone a di sperm whale's jaw. “Aye, him did dismasted off Japan,” seh di old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like him dismasted craft, him ship anodda mast widout coming home fi it. Him have a quiver a 'em.”</p>
<p>Mi did shak wid di singular posture weh him did a maintain. Pan each side a di Pequod's quarter deck, an pretty close to di mizzen shrouds, deh did have a auger hole, bored bout half an inch or so, inna di plank. Him bone leg steady inna dat deh hole; one arm elevate, an holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab did a stan up erect, a look straight out beyond di ship's ever-pitching prow. Deh did have an infinity a firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, inna di fixed an fearless, forward dedication a dat deh glance. Not a word him seh; nor him officers neva seh nutten to him; though by all dem minutest gestures an expressions, dem plainly show di uneasy, if not painful, consciousness a being unda a troubled master-eye. An not only dat, but moody stricken Ahab did a stan up infronta dem wid a crucifixion inna him face; inna all di nameless regal overbearing dignity a some mighty woe.</p>
<p>Ere long, fram him first visit inna di air, him withdraw inna him cabin. But afta dat deh maanin, him did deh every day visible to di crew; either standing inna him pivot-hole, or sidong pan a ivory stool weh him did have; or heavily walking di deck. As di sky did a get less gloomy; indeed, staat grow a likkle genial, him become still less an less a recluse; as if, wen di ship did sail fram home, notn but di dead wintry bleakness a di sea did den keep him so secluded. An, by and by, it come to pass, dat him did almost constantly inna di air; but, as yet, fi all weh him seh, or perceptibly did, pan di at last sunny deck, him did look as unnecessary deh as anodda mast. But di Pequod did only a mek a passage now; no regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives weh did need supervision di mates dem did fully competent to, so dat deh did have likkle or nutten, outa himself, fi employ or excite Ahab, now; an so chase weh, fi dat deh one interval, di clouds dem weh did a lay pan layer did a pile pan him brow, as ever all clouds choose di loftiest peaks fi pile demself pan.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ere long, di warm, warbling persuasiveness a di pleasant, holiday weather we did come to, did a look like it did a charm him fram him mood. For, as wen di red-cheeked, dancing girls, April an May, trip home to di wintry, misanthropic woods; even di barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send out some few green sprouts, fi welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, inna di end, a likkle respond to di playful allurings a dat deh girlish air. More dan once did him put out di faint blossom a one look, weh, inna any ada man, woulda soon flower out inna a smile.</p>
