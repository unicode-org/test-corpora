<h2 id="pgepubid00072">CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.</h2>
<p>A did a Saturday night, an such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. Di ivory Pequod did ton inna weh did look like a shamble; every sailor a butcher. Yuh woulda tink seh we did a offer up ten thousand red ox to di sea gods.</p>
<p>Inna di fos place, di enormous cutting tackles, mongx ada ponderous tings comprising a cluster a blocks generally paint green, an weh no single man can possibly lift—dis vast bunch a grapes did sway up to di main-top an firmly lashed to di lower mast-head, di strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck. Di end a di hawser-like rope weh winding thru dem intricacies yah, did den conduct to di windlass, an di huge lower block a di tackles did swing ova di whale; to dis block di great blubber hook, weigh some one hundred pounds, did attached. An now suspended inna stages ova di side, Starbuck an Stubb, di mates, armed wid dem long spades, staat cut a hole inna di body fi di insertion a di hook jus above di nearest a di two side-fins. Dis don, a broad, semicircular line get cut roun di hole, di hook get insert, an di main body a di crew strike up a wild chorus, now staat heaving inna one dense crowd at di windlass. Wen instantly, di entire ship careens ova pan har side; every bolt inna har staat like di nail-heads a one old house inna frosty weather; she tremble, quiver, an nod har frighted mast-heads to di sky. More an more she lean ova to di whale, while every gasping heave a di windlass get ansa by a helping heave fram di billows; til at last, a swift, startling snap is hear; wid a great swash di ship roll upwards an backwards fram di whale, an di triumphant tackle rise inna sight dragging afta it di disengaged semicircular end a di fos strip a blubber. Now as di blubber envelope di whale precisely as di rind do an orange, so is it stripped off fram di body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it. Fi di strain weh di windlass keep up constantly keep di whale rolling ova an ova inna di wata, an as di blubber inna one strip uniformly peel off along di line weh dem call di “scarf,” simultaneously cut by di spades a Starbuck an Stubb, di mates; an jus as fast as it is thus peeled off, an indeed by dat deh very act itself, it is all di time being hoisted higher an higher aloft til it upper end grazes di main-top; di man dem at di windlass den stop heaving, an fi a moment or two di prodigious blood-dripping mass sway to an fro as if dem let dung fram di sky, an every one present haffi tek good heed fi dodge it wen it swing, else it may box him ears an pitch him headlong ovaboard.</p>
<p>One a di harpooneers dem weh did a deh deh now advance wid a long, keen weapon weh dem call a boarding-sword, an watching him chance him dexterously slice out a considerable hole inna di lower part a di swaying mass. Inna dis hole, di end a di secan alternating great tackle is den hooked so as fi retain a hold upon di blubber, in order fi prepare fi weh follow. Whereupon, dis accomplished swordsman, warning all hands fi stan off, once more mek a scientific dash at di mass, an wid a few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twiin; so dat while di short lower part still fast, di long upper strip, weh dem call a blanket-piece, swing clear, an is all ready fi lower. Di heavers forward now resume dem song, an while di one tackle a peeling an hoist a secan strip fram di whale, di ada one a slowly slacken weh, an dung go di first strip chruu di main hatchway rait anda it, inna wan unfurnished parlor weh dem call di blubber-room. Inna dis twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling weh di long blanket-piece as if it was a great live mass a plaited serpents. An so di work proceed; di two tackles hoisting an lowering simultaneously; both whale an windlass heaving, di heavers singing, di blubber-room gentlemen coiling, di mates scarfing, di ship straining, an all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging di general friction.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00073">CHAPTER 68. Di Blanket.</h2>
<p>Mi neva gi no likkle attention to dat deh not unvexed subject, di skin a di whale. Mi have had controversies bout it wid experienced whalemen afloat, an learned naturalists ashore. Mi original opinion remain unchanged; but it is only an opinion.</p>
<p>Di kweschan a, weh an weh di skin a di wail animal de? Alredy yuh know weh him blubber is. Dat deh blubber a someting a di consistence a firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic an compact, an range fram eight or ten to twelve an fifteen inches inna thickness.</p>
<p>Now, however preposterous it may at first seem fi talk bout any creature's skin as being a dat deh sort a consistence an thickness, yet in point a fact dem a no arguments against such a presumption; cause yuh cyaan raise no ada dense enveloping layer fram di whale's body but dat deh same blubber; an di outermost enveloping layer a any animal, if reasonably dense, weh can dat be but di skin? True, fram di unmarred dead body a di whale, yuh may scrape off wid yuh han an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling di thinnest shreds a isinglass, only it is almost as flexible an soft as satin; dat mean, before it did dry, wen it no only contract an thicken, but it become rather hard an brittle. Mi have several such dried bits, weh mi use fi marks inna mi whale-books. It transparent, as mi seh before; an being laid upon di printed page, mi have sometimes pleased miself wid fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it pleasant fi read bout whales chruu dem own spectacles, as yuh may seh. But weh mi a drive pan yah a dis. Dat deh same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, weh, mi admit, invest di entire body a di whale, a nuh so much fi be regarded as di skin a di creature, as di skin a di skin, so fi speak; fi it was simply ridiculous fi seh, dat di proper skin a di tremendous whale is thinner an more tender dan di skin a one new-born child. But no more a dis.</p>
<p>Assuming di blubber a di skin a di whale; den, wen dis skin, as inna di case a one very big Sperm Whale, ago gi di bulk a one hundred barrels a oil; an, wen it consider seh, in quantity, or rather weight, dat oil, inna it expressed state, is only three fourths, an not di entire substance a di coat; some idea may hence be had of di enormousness a dat deh animated mass, a mere part a whose mere integument yields such a lake a liquid as dat. Reckoning ten barrels to di ton, yuh have ten tons fi di net weight a only three quarters a di stuff a di whale's skin.</p>
<p>Inna life, di visible surface a di Sperm Whale a nuh di least mongst di many marvels weh him present. Almost invariably it all ova obliquely crossed an re-crossed wid numberless straight marks inna thick array, someting like dem inna di finest Italian line engravings. But dem marks yah nuh look like dem did impress pan di isinglass substance weh mi mention above, but dem look like dem did a see chruu it, as if dem did engrave pan di body itself. No dis a all. Inna some instances, to di quick, observant eye, dem linear marks deh, as inna a veritable engraving, but afford di ground fi far ada delineations. Dem deh a hieroglyphical; dat mean, if yuh call dem mysterious cyphers deh pan di walls a pyramids hieroglyphics, den dat a di proper wod fi use inna di present connexion. By mi retentive memory a di hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, mi did much struck wid a plate weh represent di old Indian characters chiselled pan di famous hieroglyphic palisades pan di banks a di Upper Mississippi. Like dem mystic rocks deh, too, di mystic-marked whale remain undecipherable. Dis allusion to di Indian rocks remind mi a anodda ting. Besides all di ada phenomena dem weh di exterior a di Sperm Whale present, him no seldom display di back, an more especially him flanks, effaced inna great part a di regular linear appearance, by reason a numerous rude scratches, altogether a an irregular, random aspect. Mi shuda seh dat dem New England rocks deh pan di sea-coast, weh Agassiz imagine fi bear di marks a violent scraping contact wid vast floating icebergs—mi shuda seh, dat dem rocks deh mus not a likkle resemble di Sperm Whale inna dis particular. It also seems to mi seh such scratches inna di whale probably mek by hostile contact wid other whales; fi mi have most remarked dem inna di big, full-grown bulls a di species.</p>
<p>A word or two more concerning dis matter of di skin or blubber a di whale. It don seh aredi, seh it strip fram him inna long pieces, weh dem call blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, dis one is very happy an significant. For di whale is indeed wrap up inna him blubber as inna a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slip ova him head, an skirting him extremity. A by reason a dis cozy blanketing a him body, mek di whale can keep himself comfortable inna all weathers, inna all seas, times, an tides. Weh woulda happen a Greenland whale, seh, inna dem deh shuddering, icy seas a di North, if unsupplied wid him cozy surtout? True, ada fish dem find exceedingly brisk inna dem deh Hyperborean waters; but dem ya, be it observed, a yuh cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies a refrigerators; creatures, weh warm demself unda di lee a one iceberg, as a traveler inna winta woulda bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, di whale have lungs an warm blood. Freeze him blood, an him dead. How wonderful it is den—except afta explanation—dat dis great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful dat him shuda be found at home, immersed to him lips fi life inna dem Arctic waters deh! weh, wen seamen dem fall ovaboard, dem sometimes find dem, months aftawards, perpendicularly frozen inna di hearts a fields a ice, as a fly is found glued inna amber. But more surprising is it fi know, as has been proved by experiment, dat di blood a one Polar whale is warmer dan dat a one Borneo negro inna summer.</p>
<p>It does seem to mi, dat herein wi see di rare virtue a one strong individual vitality, an di rare virtue a thick walls, an di rare virtue a interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire an model yuhself afta di whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Yuh, too, live inna dis ya worl widout being a it. Be cool at di equator; kip yuh blood fluid at di Pole. Like di great dome a St. Peter's, an like di great whale, retain, O man! inna all seasons a temperature a yuh own.</p>
<p>Bot ou it iizi an ou nobadi kyaahn uop fi tiich dem gud sitn ya! A erections, how few dem dome like St. Peter's! a creatures, how few vast as di whale!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00074">CHAPTER 69. Di Funeral.</h2>
<p>“Pul iin di chien dem an mek di ded badi go bak a di ruod!”</p>
<p>Di vast tackles dem don done dem duty now. Di peeled white body a di beheaded whale flash like a marble sepulchre; though it change inna hue, it neva perceptibly lost nutten inna bulk. It still colossal. Slowly it float more an more weh, di wata roun it torn an splash by di insatiate sharks, an di air above vexed wid rapacious flights a screamining fowls, whose beaks dem like so many insulting poniards inna di whale. Di vast white headless phantom float furda an furda fram di ship, an every rod weh it so float, weh look like square roods a sharks an cubic roods a fowls, augment di murderous din. Fi hours an hours fram di almost stationary ship dat deh hideous sight is seen. Anda di unclouded an mild azure sky, pan di fair face a di pleasant sea, wafted by di joyous breezes, dat deh great mass a death float on an on, til lost inna infinite perspectives.</p>
<p>A one most doleful an most mocking funeral! Di sea-vultures dem all inna pious mourning, di air-sharks dem all punctiliously inna black or speckled. Inna life but few a dem woulda help di whale, mi ween, if peradventure him did need it; but pan di banquet a him funeral dem most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! fram weh not di mightiest whale free.</p>
<p>Dis a nuh di end. Desecrated as di body is, a vengeful ghost survive an hover ova it fi scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel fram far, wen di distance obscuring di swarming fowls, nevertheless still show di white mass floating inna di sun, an di white spray heaving high against it; straightway di whale's unharming corpse, wid trembling fingers set dung inna di log— <i>shoals, rocks, an breakers hereabouts: beware!</i> An fi years aftawards, perhaps, ships shun di place; leap ova it as silly sheep leap ova a vacuum, cause dem leader did a leap deh wen dem did a hold a stick. Deh deh yuh law a precedents; deh deh yuh utility a traditions; deh deh di story bout yuh obstinate survival a old beliefs neva bottom pan di earth, an now not even hovering inna di air! Orthodoxy deh deh!</p>
<p>So, while inna life di great whale's body may have been a real terror to him foes, inna him death him ghost become a powerless panic to a world.</p>
<p>Yuh a one believer inna ghosts, mi fren? Deh have ada ghosts dan di Cock-Lane one, an far deeper man dan Doctor Johnson weh believe inna dem.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00075">CHAPTER 70. Di Sphynx.</h2>
<p>It shudn't have been omitted dat before to completely stripping di body a di leviathan, dem did behead him. Now, di beheading a di Sperm Whale a one scientific anatomical feat, weh experienced whale surgeons very much pride demself: an not widout reason.</p>
<p>Consider seh di whale nuh have nutten weh can properly be called a neck; pan di contrary, weh him head an body look like dem a join, deh, inna dat deh very place, a di thickest part a him. Memba, tu, seh di surgeon haffi operate fram above, some eight or ten feet intervening between him an him subject, an dat subject almost hidden inna a discoloured, rolling, an oftentimes tumultuous an bursting sea. Memba seh unda dem untoward circumstances yah him haffi cut plenty feet deep inna di flesh; an inna dat deh subterraneous manner, widout so much as getting one single peep inna di ever-contracting gash so mek, him haffi skilfully steer clear a all adjacent, interdicted parts, an exactly divide di spine at a critical point hard by its insertion inna di skull. Yuh no marvel, den, at Stubb's boast, dat him demand but ten minutes fi behead a sperm whale?</p>
<p>Wen dem fos kot, di head get drop astern an hold deh by a cable til di body strip. Dat done, if it belong to a likkle whale it is hoisted on deck fi be deliberately disposed of. But, wid a full grown leviathan dis is impossible; fi di sperm whale head embrace nearly one third a him entire bulk, an completely fi suspend such a burden as dat, even by di immense tackles a one whaler, dis was as vain a ting as fi try weigh a Dutch barn inna jewellers' scales.</p>
<p>Di Pequod's whale get decapitate an di body stripped, di head did hoisted against di ship's side—bout half way outa di sea, so dat it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. An deh wid di strained craft steeply lean ova to it, by reason a di enormous downward drag fram di lower mast-head, an every yard-arm pan dat deh side projecting like a crane ova di waves; deh, dat deh blood-dripping head did a hang to di Pequod's waist like di giant Holofernes's fram di girdle a Judith.</p>
<p>Wen dis laas wok did don a did nait, an di siman dem go dong de fi dem dina. Silence reign ova di before tumultuous but now deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more an more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon di sea.</p>
<p>A shaat space laas, an up inna dis noiselessness come Ahab alone fram him cabin. Tek a few turns pan di quarter-deck, him pause fi gaze ova di side, den slowly get inna di main-chains him tek Stubb's long spade—still remaining deh afta di whale's decapitation—an strike it inna di lower part a di half-suspended mass, put it other end crutch-wise unda one arm, an sood wid eyes leaning ova attentively fixed pan dis head.</p>
<p>A did a black an hooded head; an hanging deh inna di middle a so intense a calm, it did look like di Sphynx did deh inna di desert. “Speak, yuh big an venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished wid a beard, yet yah an deh look hoary wid mosses; talk, mighty head, an tell wi di secret ting weh deh inna yuh. Outa all divers, yuh dive di deepest. Dat deh head pan weh di upper sun gleams now, don found inna dis world's words. unrecorded names an navies rust, an untold hopes an anchors rot; yuh si di locked lovers dem wen dem did a jomp fram dem flaming ship; sail on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship weh woulda bearne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms O head yuh have seen enough fi split di planets an mek an infidel a Abraham, an not one syllable is youre!”</p>
<p>“Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice fram di main-mast-head.</p>
<p>“Aye? Well, now, dat a cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erect himself, while whole thunder-clouds sweep aside fram him brow. “Dat lively cry pan dis deadly calm might almost convert a better man.—Where away?”</p>
<p>“Three points pan di starboard bow, sir, an bringin dung har breeze to wi!</p>
<p>“Better an beta, man. Would now St. Paul woulda come along dat deh way, an to mi breezelessness woulda bring him breeze! O Nature, an O soul a man! how far beyond all utterance are yuh linked analogies! not di smallest atom stirs or lives pan matter, but have its cunning duplicate in mind.”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00076">CHAPTER 71. Di Jeroboam's Story.</h2>
<p>Han inna han, ship an briiz blow aan; but di breeze did a come faster dan di ship, an soon di Pequod staat rock.</p>
<p>By an by, chruu di glass di stranger's boats an manned mast-heads prove har a whale-ship. But as she did so far to windward, an shooting by, apparently mek a passage to some other ground, di Pequod couldn't hope fi reach har. So di signal did set fi si weh response woulda mek.</p>
<p>Yahso be it seh, dat like di vessels a military marines, di ships a di American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals being collected inna a book wid di names a di respective vessels attached, every captain is provided wid it. So, di whale commanders dem can recognize each other pan di ocean, even at considerable distances an wid no small facility.</p>
<p>Di Pequod's signal did at last respond to by di stranger's setting har own; weh prove seh di ship a di Jeroboam a Nantucket. Squaring har yards, she bore dung, range abeam unda di Pequod's lee, an lower a boat; it soon did a come nier; but, as di side-ladder did a get rigged by Starbuck's order fi accommodate di visiting captain, di stranger in question wave him han fram him boat's stern in token a dat proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turn out seh di Jeroboam did have a malignant epidemic pan board, an dat Mayhew, har captain, did fraid fi infect di Pequod's company. For, though himself an boat's crew did remain untainted, an though him ship did half a rifle-shot off, an an incorruptible sea an air did a roll an flow between; yet concientiously adhering to di timid quarantine a di lan, him peremptorily refuse fi come inna direct contact wid di Pequod.</p>
<p>But dis did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an interval a some few yards between itself an di ship, di Jeroboam's boat by di occasional use a it oars contrived fi keep parallel to di Pequod, as she heavily forged through di sea (for by dis time it blow very fresh), wid har main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by di sudden onset a one big rolling wave, di boat woulda be pushed some way ahead; but woulda be soon skilfully bringed to har proper bearings again. Subject to dis, an other di like interruptions now an den, a conversation was sustained between di two parties; but at intervals not widout still another interruption of a very different sort.</p>
<p>Pulling an oar inna di Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular appearance, even inna dat deh wild whaling life weh individual notabilities mek up all totalities. Im was a likkle, short, youngish man, sprinkled all ova im face wid freckles, an wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat a faded walnut tinge envelop him; di overlap sleeves dem weh did roll up pan him wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium did deh inna him eyes.</p>
<p>So suun az dis figa did fos diskraib, Stubb did exclaim—“A im! dat a im!—di lang-togged scaramouch di Town-Ho kompini tel wi bout!” Stubb yah allude to a strange story weh dem did tell bout di Jeroboam, an a certain man mongst har crew, some time before wen di Pequod did a taak di Town-Ho. According to dis account an weh dem did laan afta dat, it did look like di scaramouch inna kweschan did get a wonderful ascendency ova almost everybody inna di Jeroboam. Him story was dis:</p>
<p>Im did originally nurtured mongst di crazy society a Neskyeuna Shakers, weh im did a great prophet; inna dem cracked, secret meetings having several times descended fram heaven by di way a trap-door, announceng di speedy opening a di seventh vial, weh him did a carry inna him vest-pocket; but, weh, insted a contain gunpowder, did suppose fi be charged wid laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having seize him, him did lef Neskyeuna fi Nantucket, weh, wid dat deh cunning peculiar to craziness, him assume a steady, common-sense exterior, an offer himself as a green-hand candidate fi di Jeroboam's whaling voyage. Dem engage him; but straightway upon di ship get outa sight a lan, him insanity break out inna a freshet. Him announce himself as di archangel Gabriel, an command di captain fi jump ovaboard. Him publish him manifesto, weh him set himself out as di deliverer a di isles a di sea an vicar-general a all Oceanica. Di unflinching earnestness wid weh him did a declare dem ting deh;—di dark, daring play a him sleepless, excited imagination, an all di preternatural terrors a real delirium, united fi invest dis Gabriel inna di minds a di majority a di ignorant crew, wid an atmosphere a sacredness. Plos, dem did fried a im. As such a man, however, neva did a much practical use inna di ship, especially as him did refuse fi work except wen him pleased, di incredulous captain woulda fain have been rid a him; but apprised dat dat individual's intention was fi land him inna di first convenient port, di archangel forthwith open all him seals an vials—devoting di ship an all hands to unconditional perdition, in case dis intention was carried out. So strongly him did a work pan him disciples mongst di crew, dat at last inna a body dem go to di captain an tell him seh if Gabriel did sen outa di ship, no man a dem woulda stay. So him did afi lef him plan. Nor dem woulda permit Gabriel fi get maltreated any way, seh or do weh him woulda; so dat it come to pass dat Gabriel did have di complete freedom a di ship. Di consequence a all dis was, dat di archangel care likkle or nutten fi di captain an mates; an since di epidemic did break out, him did a carry a higher hand dan eva; declaring seh di plague, as him call it, was at him sole command; nor it fi stay but according to him good pleasure. Di sailors dem, mostly poor devils, did a cringe, an some a dem did a fawn inna him; in obedience to him instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god. Dem deh ting deh maita look incredible; but, how wonderous, dem true. Nor is di history a fanatics half so striking in respect to di measureless self-deception a di fanatic himself, as him measureless power a deceiving an bedeviling so many others. But a time fi go back to di Pequod.</p>
<p>“Mi no fraid a thy epidemic, man,” seh Ahab fram di bulwarks, to Captain Mayhew, weh did a stan op inna di boat's stern; “come on board.”</p>
<p>But now Gabriel staat fi stan up.</p>
<p>“Tingk bout di fiiva dem, yelo an bilious! Beware a di torbl plaag!”</p>
<p>“Gabriel! Gabriel!” Captain Mayhew did a baal out; “yuh mus either—” But dat instant a headlong wave shot di boat far ahead, an its seethings drown all speech.</p>
<p>“Yuh si di White Whale?” Ahab did a demand, wen di boat did a drift back.</p>
<p>“Tingk, tink bout yuh whale-boat, stoven an sunk! Beware a di horrible tail!”</p>
<p>“Mi tell yuh again, Gabriel, dat—” But again di boat tore ahead as if drag by fiends. Notn neva seh fi some moments, while a succession a riotous waves did a roll by, weh by one a dem occasional caprices a di seas did a tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, di hoisted sperm whale's head did a jog bout very violently, an Gabriel did a look pan it wid rather more apprehensiveness dan him archangel nature did a look fi warrant.</p>
<p>Wen dis interlude did don, Captain Mayhew staat a dark story bout Moby Dick; not, however, widout frequent interruptions fram Gabriel, whenever him name did mention, an di crazy sea weh did look like did a league wid him.</p>
<p>It did look like di Jeroboam neva lef home lang, wen dem did a taak bout a whale-ship, har people dem did reliably apprised a di existence a Moby Dick, an di havoc weh him did mek. Greedily sucking inna dis intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warn di captain against attacking di White Whale, in case di monster shuda be seen; inna him gibbering insanity, pronouncing di White Whale fi be no less a being dan di Shaker God incarnated; di Shakers dem a get di Bible. But wen, some year or two aftawards, Moby Dick did fairly sighted fram di mast-heads, Macey, di chief mate, burn wid ardor fi encounter him; an di captain himself neva unwilling fi mek him have di opportunity, despite all di archangel's denunciations an forewarnings, Macey succeed inna persuade five man fi man him boat. Wid dem him push off; an, afta much weary pulling, an many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, him at last succeed in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to di main-royal mast-head, did a toss one arm inna frantic gestures, an a hurling forth prophecies a speedy doom to di sacrilegious assailants a him divinity. Now, while Macey, di mate, did a stan up inna him boat's bow, an wid all di reckless energy a him tribe did a venting him wild exclamations upon di whale, an a essay fi get a fair chance fi him poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow did a come fram di sea; bai it quick, fanning motion, temporarily tek di breath outa di bodies a di oarsmen dem. Next instant, di luckless mate, so full a furious life, did get smitten bodyly inna di air, an mek a long arc inna him descent, fall inna di sea at di distance a bout fifty yards. Not a chip a di boat neva get hart, nor a hair a no oarsman's head; but di mate fi eva sink.</p>
<p>It is well fi parenthesize yah, dat a di fatal accidents inna di Sperm-Whale Fishery, dis kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any. Somtaim, notn no get injured but di man weh get so annihilated; oftener di boat's bow get knock off, or di thigh-board, in which di headsman stan up, get torn fram it place an accompany di body. But strangest a all is di circumstance, dat in more instances dan one, wen di body get recover, not a single mark a violence is discernible; di man did ded.</p>
<p>Di whole calamity, wid di falling form a Macey, did plainly described fram di ship. Dem baal out a piercing, “Di vial! Gabriel call off di terror-striken crew fram di further hunting a di whale. Dis terrible event clothed di archangel wid added influence; cause him credulous disciples dem did believe seh him did specifically fore-announce it, instead a only mek a general prophecy, weh any one might did done, an so have chance fi hit one a di many marks inna di wide margin weh dem did allow. Im ton a nameless terror to di ship.</p>
<p>Mayhew did don im narration, Ahab put such questions to him, dat di stranger captain couldn't forbear inquiring weda him did intend fi hunt di White Whale, if opportunity shuda offer. To weh Ahab ansa—“Aye.” Straightway, den, Gabriel once more staat up him foot, glaring pan di ole man, an vehemently exclaimed, wid downward pointed finga—“Think, tink bout di blasphemer—dead, an dung deh!—beware a di blasphemer's end!”</p>
<p>Ahab stolidly turn aside; den seh to Mayhew, “Captain, mi jus tink bout mi letta-bag; a leta deh fi one a yuh officers, if mi no mistake. Starbuck, look ova di bag.”</p>
<p>Every whale-ship tek out a goodly numba a letta fi various ships, whose delivery to di persons to whom dem may be addressed, depends upon di mere chance fi encounter dem inna di four oceans. So, most letta dem neva reach dem mark; an plenty a dem only get afta dem reach two or three years or more.</p>
<p>Soon Starbuck come back wid a letta inna him han. It did sorely tumbled, damp, an cover wid a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence a being kept inna a dark locker a di cabin. A such a letta, Death himself might well been di post-boy.</p>
<p>“Yuh can't read it?” Ahab baal out. “Gi it mi, man. Aye, aye, it's jus a dim scrawl;—weh dis?” As him did a study it out, Starbuck tek a long cutting-spade pole, an wid him knife slightly split di end, fi insert di letta deh, an inna dat deh way, gi it to di boat, widout it coming no closer to di ship.</p>
<p>Meantime, Ahab holding di letta, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a woman's pinny hand,—di man's wife, mi ago wager)—Aye—Mr. Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;—why it's Macey, an him dead!”</p>
<p>“Poor fellow! poor fellow! an fram him wife,” Mayhew sigh; “but mek mi have it.”</p>
<p>“Nay, keep it yuhself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “yuh soon a go deh way deh.”</p>
<p>“Curses throttle yuh!” Ahab baal out. “Captain Mayhew, stan by now fi receive it”; an tek di fatal missive fram Starbuck's han dem, im ketch it inna di slit a di pole, an reach it ova towards di boat. But as him did a do so, di oarsmen dem expectantly desisted fram rowing; di boat drift likkle towards di ship's stern; so dat, as if by magic, di letta suddenly range along wid Gabriel's eager han. Im clutch it inna wan instant, grab di boat-knife, an impaling di letta pan it, sen it so loaded back inna di ship. It jrap a Ehab fut. Den Gabriel shriek out to him comrades fi give way wid dem oars, an inna dat deh manner di mutinous boat rapidly shot weh fram di Pequod.</p>
<p>As, afta dis interlude, di seamen dem resume dem work pan di jacket a di whale, plenty strange tings did hint in reference to dis wild affair.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00077">CHAPTER 72. Di Monkey-Rope.</h2>
<p>Inna di tumultuous business a cutting-in an attending to a whale, deh a running backwards an forwards mongst di crew. Now hands dem waan yah, an den again hands dem waan deh. Nobadi kyaahn stay inna no one place; fi at one an di same time everyting haffi be done everyweh. A di same ting wid him weh endeavour di description a di scene. Wi haffi retrace wi way likkle now. It was mentioned dat upon first breaking ground inna di whale's back, di blubber-hook did insert inna di original hole deh cut by di spades a di mates. But how so clumsy an weighty a mass as dat deh same hook get fix inna dat deh hole? It did insert deh by mi particular fren Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, fi descend pan di monster's back fi di special purpose weh dem did a refer to. But inna very many cases, circumstances require dat di harpooneer shall remain pan di whale til di whole flensing or stripping operation don. Di whale, be it observed, lay almost entirely submerged, excepting di immediate parts weh dem operate upon. So dung deh, some ten feet below di level a di deck, di poor harpooneer flounders bout, half pan di whale an half inna di wata, as di vast mass revolve like a tread-mill unda him. Pan di occasion in question, Queequeg figure inna di Highland costume—a shirt an socks—in which to mi eyes, at least, him did appear to uncommon advantage; an nobadi neva have a beta chance fi observe him, as wi a go si now.</p>
<p>Being di savage's bowsman, dat is, di person weh did pull di bow-oar inna him boat (di secan one fram forward), it was mi cheerful duty fi attend pan him wile mi did a tek dat deh hard-scrabble scramble pan di dead whale's back. Yuh si Italian organ-boys a hold a dancing-ape by a long cord. Jus so, fram di ship's steep side, did mi hold Queequeg dung deh inna di sea, by weh dem technically call inna di fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip a canvas belt roun him waist.</p>
<p>A did a humorously perilous business fi di two a wi. For, before we proceed further, it haffi seh dat di monkey-rope did fast at both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, an fast to mi narrow leather one. So fi beta or fi wos, wi two, fi di taim, did wed; an if poor Queequeg sink fi rise no more, den both usage an honor demand, dat instead a cut di cord, it shuda drag mi dung inna him wake. So, den, an elongated Siamese ligature united wi. Queequeg was mi own inseparable twin bredda; nor couldn't any way get rid a di dangerous liabilities weh di hempen bond did entail.</p>
<p>So strongly an metaphysically did mi conceive a mi situation den, dat while earnestly watch him motions, mi did seem distinctly fi perceive seh mi own individuality did now merged inna a joint stock company a two; dat mi free will did get a mortal wound; an dat anodda mistake or misfortune might plunge inocent mi inna unmerited disaster an death. So, mi si seh yahso a did a sort a interregnum inna Providence; fi it even-handed equity neva coulda have so gross an injustice. An yet still further pondering—while mi jerk him now an den fram between di whale an ship, weh woulda threaten fi jam him—stil further pondering, mi seh, mi si seh dis situation a mi was di precise situation a every mortal weh breath; only, inna most cases, him, one way or other, have dis Siamese connexion wid a plurality a ada mortals. If yuh banker break, yuh snap; if yuh apothecary by mistake sen yuh poison inna yuh pills, yuh dead. True, yuh may seh dat, by exceeding caution, yuh may possibly escape dem yah an di multitudinous ada evil chances a life. But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as mi woulda, sometimes him jerk it so, dat mi come very near sliding ovaboard. Nor mi couldn't possibly forget dat, do weh mi woulda, mi only did have di management a one end a it.*</p>
<p>*Di monkey-rope deh inna all whalers; but it was only inna di Pequod dat di monkey an him holder did eva tie tugeda. Dis improvement pan di original usage did introduce by no less a man dan Stubb, in order fi afford di imperiled harpooneer di strongest possible guarantee fi di faithfulness an vigilance a him monkey-rope holder.</p>
<p>Mi don hint seh mi woulda often jerk poor Queequeg fram between di whale an di ship—weh him woulda occasionally fall, fram di incessant rolling an swaying a both. But dis neva di only jamming jeopardy weh him did expose to. Unappalled by di massacre weh did mek pan dem during di night, di sharks dem now freshly an more keenly allured by di before pent blood weh did staat flow fram di carcass—di rabid creatures dem did a swarm roun it like bees inna a beehive.</p>
<p>An right inna dem shark deh was Queequeg; who often push dem aside wid him floundering feet. A ting altogether incredible if it neva dat attracted by such prey as a dead whale, di otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it may well be believed dat since dem have such a ravenous finger inna di pie, it is deemed but wise fi look sharp to dem. Accordingly, besides di monkey-rope, wid which mi now an den jerk di poor fellow fram too close a vicinity to di maw a weh did look like a peculiarly ferocious shark—im did get provide wid still anodda protection. Suspended ova di side inna one a di stages, Tashtego an Daggoo continually flourish ova him head a couple a keen whale-spades, weh dem slaughter as many sharks as dem coulda reach. Dis procedure a dem, fi be sure, was very disinterested an benevolent a dem. Dem did mean Queequeg's bes happiness, mi admit; but inna dem hasty zeal fi befriend him, an fram di circumstance dat both him an di sharks dem did at times half hidden by di blood-muddled water, dem indiscreet spades a dem woulda come nearer amputating a leg dan a tail. But poor Queequeg, mi suppose, straining an gasping deh wid dat deh great iron hook—poor Queequeg, mi suppose, only pray to him Yojo, an give up him life into di hands a him gods.</p>
<p>Well, well, mi dear comrade an twin-bradda, did tink mi, as mi did a draw in an den slack off di rope to every swell a di sea—weh matta it, afta all? Yuh a nuh di precious image a each an all a wi man dem inna dis whaling world? Dat deh unsounded ocean weh yuh gasp inna, a Life; dem shark deh, yuh foes; dem spades deh, yuh fren dem; an weh between sharks an spades yuh deh inna a sad pickle an peril, poor lad.</p>
<p>But courage! good cheer deh fi yuh, Queequeg. Fi now, as wid blue lips an blood-shot eyes di exhausted savage at last climb up di chains an stan up all dripping an involuntarily trembling ova di side; di steward advances, an wid a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him—what? Som hot Cognac? No! han him, ye gods! gi him a cup a tepid ginger an water!</p>
<p>“Ginger? Mi smell ginger?” Stubb aks suspiciously, coming near. “Yes, dis mus be ginger,” peering inna di as yet untasted cup. Den stan up as if im neva believe fi a while, im calmly walk towards di astonished steward slowly an seh, “Ginger? ginger? an yuh wi have di goodness fi tell mi, Mr. Dough-Boy, weh di virtue a ginger deh? Ginger! a ginger di sort a fuel yuh use, Dough-boy, fi kindle a finga inna dis canibal—hat di ginger? devil is ginger? Sea-coal?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—weh di devil is ginger, mi seh, dat yuh offer dis cup to our poor Queequeg yah.”</p>
<p>“A some sneaking Temperance Society movement bout dis business,” him suddenly added, now a approach Starbuck, weh did jus come fram forward. “Yuh wi look pan dat deh kannakin, sir: smell a it, if yuh please.” Den watching di mate's countenance, him added, “Di steward, Mr. Starbuck, did have di face fi offer dat deh calomel an jalap to Queequeg, deh, dis instant off di whale. A di steward an apothecary, sir? an mi can ask if dis a di sort a bitters by which him blow back di life into a half-drowned man?”</p>
<p>“Mi trust not,” seh Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, steward,” Stubb baal out, “we ago teach yuh fi drug a harpooneer; none a yuh apothecary's medicine deh yah; yuh waan poison wi, no chruu? Yuh have out insurances pan wi life an waan murder wi all, an pocket di proceeds, no?”</p>
<p>“A neva mi,” Dough-Boy baal out, “a did Aunt Charity weh bring di ginger pan board; an bade mi fi neva gi di harpooneers dem no spirit, but only dis ginger-jub—so shi did call it.”</p>
<p>“Ginger-jub! yuh gingerly rascal! tek dat! an run wid yuh to di lockers, an get someting better. Mi hope mi do nuh wrong, Mr. Starbuck. A di captain's orders—grog fi di harpooneer pan a whale.”</p>
<p>“Enough,” Starbuck ansa, “only no hit him again, but—”</p>
<p>“Oh, mi neva hurt wen mi hit, except wen mi hit a whale or someting a dat sort; an dis fellow a one weazel. Weh yuh did a seh, sa?”</p>
<p>“Only dis: go dung wid him, an get weh yuh waan yuhself.”</p>
<p>Wen Stubb reappear, him come wid a dark flask inna one han, an a sort a tea-caddy inna di nex one. Di fos wan did have strong spirits, an dem did gi it to Queequeg; di secan one was Aunt Charity's gift, an dat was freely given to di waves.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00078">CHAPTER 73. Stubb an Flask kill a Right Whale; an Den Have a Talk ova Him.</h2>
<p>It mus be borne inna mind seh all dis time wi have a Sperm Whale's prodigious head hanging to di Pequod's side. But wi haffi mek it gwaan hang de a while til wi can get a chance fi attend to it. Fi di present ada matters press, an di bes wi can do now fi di head, is fi pray heaven di tackles dem may hold.</p>
<p>Now, during di past night an forenoon, di Pequod did gradually drift into a sea, weh, by its occasional patches a yellow brit, did gi unusual tokens a di vicinity a Right Whales, a species a di Leviathan weh but few suppose to be at dis particular time lurking anywhere near. An though all hands commonly disdained di capture a dem inferior creatures deh; an though di Pequod neva get commission fi cruise fi dem at all, an though she did pass numbers a dem near di Crozetts widout lowering a boat; yet now dat a Sperm Whale did bring alongside an beheaded, to di surprise a all, di announcement did mek seh a Right Whale shuda get capture dat deh day, if opportunity did offer.</p>
<p>Nor dis was long wanting. Tall spouts dem did see to leeward; an two boat, Stubb's an Flask's, did get detach inna pursuit. Pulling further an further away, dem at last become almost invisible to di man dem at di mast-head. But suddenly inna di distance, dem si a big heap a tumultuous white water, an soon afta news come fram aloft seh one or both a di boats dem haffi fast. An interval pass an di boats dem did inna plain sight, inna di act a being drag right towards di ship by di towing whale. So close did di monster come to di hull, dat at first it did look like him did mean it malice; but suddenly going dung inna a maelstrom, widin three rods a di planks, him wholly disappear fram view, as if him did a dive unda di keel. “Cut, cut!” was di cry fram di ship to di boats, weh, fi one instant, did look like dem did a bring wid a deadly dash against di vessel's side. But because dem did have plenty a line yet inna di tubs, an di whale neva did a sound very rapid, dem pay out plenty a rope, an at di same time pul wid all dem power so as fi get ahead a di ship. Fi a few minutes di struggle did intensely critical; fi while dem still a slack out di tightened line inna one direction, an still a plied dem oars inna anodda one, di contending strain a threaten fi tek dem unda. But a did only a few feet advance dem did a try fi gain. An dem stie pan it til dem get it; wen instantly, a swift tremor did feel running like lightning along di keel, as di strained line, scraping beath di ship, suddenly rise fi view unda har bows, snapping an quivering; an so flinging off it drippings, dat di drops dem fall like bits a broken glass pan di wata, while di whale beyond also rose to sight, an once more di boats dem did free fi fly. But di fagged whale abated him speed, an blindly altering him course, go roun di stern a di ship towing di two boat dem afta him, so dat dem perform a complete circuit.</p>
<p>Meantime, dem haul more an more pan dem lines, til close flanking him pan both sides, Stubb ansa Flask wid lance fi lance; an so round an round di Pequod di battle go, while di multitudes a sharks dem weh did a swim roun di Sperm Whale's body before, rush to di fresh blood weh did a spill, thirstily drink at every new gash, as di eager Israelites dem did a do at di new bursting fountains weh did a pour fram di smitten rock.</p>
<p>At last him spout grow thick, an wid a frightful roll an vomit, him turn pan him back a corpse.</p>
<p>While di two headsman dem did a mek fast cords to him flukes, an inna ada ways a get di mass inna readiness fi towing, some conversation did a gwaan between dem.</p>
<p>“Mi wanda weh di ole man waan wid dis lump a foul lard,” Stubb seh, not widout some disgust at di thought a having fi do wid so ignoble a leviathan.</p>
<p>“Yuh waan wid it?” Flask seh, a coil some spare line inna di boat's bow, "yuh neva hear seh di ship weh but once have a Sperm Whale's head hoisted pan har starboard side, an at di same time a Right Whale's pan di larboard; yuh neva hear, Stubb, seh dat deh ship can neva capsize aftawards?"</p>
<p>"Wah mek?</p>
<p>“Mi no know, but mi hear dat deh gamboge ghost a Fedallah seh so, an him look like him know all bout ships' charms. But mi sometimes tink him ago charm di ship to no good at last. Mi nuh half like dat deh chap, Stubb. Yuh eva notice how dat deh tusk a him a one sort a carve inna a snake's head, Stubb?”</p>
<p>“Sink him! Mi neva look pan him at all; but if eva mi get a chance a one dark night, an him stan op hard by di bulwarks, an nobody by; look dung deh, Flask”—pointing inna di sea wid a peculiar motion a both hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, mi tek dat deh Fedallah fi be di devil inna di disguise weh yuh did a believe bout him bulwark an him bulwark. stowed weh pan ship? Im seh. Di reason why yuh nuh see him tail, is because him carry it coiled weh inna him pocket, mi guess Blast him now dat mi tink bout it.</p>
<p>“Im sliip iina im buot, iihn?Im no gat no hamak, bot mi siim a lie dong a nait iina wan koil a riging.”</p>
<p>“No doubt, an a because a him cursed tail; him coil it dung, do yuh see, inna di eye a di rigging.”</p>
<p>“A wa di uol man av so moch fi du wid im fa?”</p>
<p>“Striking up a swap or a bargain, mi suppose.”</p>
<p>“Bargain?—bout weh?”</p>
<p>“Why, do yuh see, di old man hard bent afta dat deh White Whale, an di devil deh a try come roun him, an get him fi swap weh him silver watch, or him soul, or someting a dat deh sort, an den him ago surrender Moby Dick.”</p>
<p>“Pooh! Stubb, yuh a skylark; how Fedallah can do dat?”</p>
<p>“Mi no know, Flask, but di devil a one curious chap, an a wicked one, mi tell yuh. Why, dem seh as how him did go a sauntering inna di ole flag-ship once, switching him tail bout devilish easy an gentlemanlike, an inquiring if di ole governor did deh a yaad. Well, him did deh a yaad, an ask di devil weh him did waan, switch up him hoofs. an seh, 'Mi waan John.' 'Weh fi?' seh di ole governor. 'Weh business dat a yuh,' seh di devil, get mad,—'Mi waan use him.' 'Tek him,' seh di governor—an by di Lord, Flask, if di devil neva gi John di Asiatic cholera before him get through wid him, mi ago eat dis whale inna one mouthful.</p>
<p>“Mi tink mi memba some such story as yuh did a tell,” seh Flask, wen at last di two boat dem did a slowly advance wid dem burden towards di ship, “but mi cyan memba weh.”</p>
<p>“Three Spaniards? Adventures of dem three bloody-minded soldaoes? Yuh did read it deh, Flask? Mi guess yuh did?”</p>
<p>“No: neva si such a book; hear bout it, though. But now, tell mi, Stubb, yuh tink seh dat deh devil yuh did a talk bout jus now, was di same yuh seh deh pan di Pequod now?”</p>
<p>“A mi di same man weh did help kill dis whale? Di devil nuh live fi eva; who eva hear seh di devil dead? Yuh eva si any parson a wearing mourning fi di devil? An if di devil have a latch-key fi get inna di admiral's cabin, yuh nuh suppose him can crawl inna a porthole dat deh mell, Mr Flask?</p>
<p>“How old yuh tink Fedallah is, Stubb?”</p>
<p>“Yuh si dat deh mainmast deh?” pointing to di ship; “well, dat a di figure one; now tek all di hoops inna di Pequod's hold, an string along inna a row wid dat deh mast, fi oughts, yuh see; well, dat wouldn't staat fi be Fedallah's age. Nor all di coopers inna creation couldn't show hoops enough fi mek oughts enough.”</p>
<p>“But si yah, Stubb, mi did tink yuh did a buos likl bit jos now, seh yuh did mean fi gi Fedallah a sea-toss, if yuh get a gud chance. Now, if him so uol az aal a dem hoops a yuh kom tu, an if him a go liv fi eva, weh gud it ago du fi pitch im uovabord—tel mi dat?</p>
<p>“Gi him a good ducking, anyhow.”</p>
<p>“But him woulda crawl back.”</p>
<p>“Duck im agen, an gwaan duck im.”</p>
<p>“Suppose him shuda tek it inna him head fi duck yuh, though—yes, an drown yuh—weh den?”</p>
<p>“Mi shuda like fi si him try it; mi woulda gi him such a pair a black eyes dat him wouldn't dare fi show him face inna di admiral's cabin again fi a long while, let alone dung inna di orlop deh, weh him live, an hereabouts pan di upper decks weh him sneak so much. Damn di devil, so Flask yuh suppose a devil; A uu fried a im, eksep di uol govana we no deriet fi kech im an put im iina dobl-darbies, laik ou im dizorv, bot mek im go bout a kidnap piipl; aye, an sain a bond wid im, se aal a di piipl dem we di devl kidnap, im wuda rosh fi im?</p>
<p>“Yuh tink Fedallah waan kidnap Captain Ahab?”</p>
<p>“Mi suppose it? Yuh wi know it before long, Flask. But mi a go now fi keep a sharp look-out pan him; an if mi see anyting very suspicious a gwaan, mi wi jus tek him by di nape a him neck, an seh—Look yah, Beelzebub, yuh nuh do it; an if him mek any fuss, by di Lord'll'll'll'll'll mek him grab inna him poet, tek it to di capstan, an gi him such a wrenching an heaving, dat him tail ago come short off at di stump—do yuh see; an den, mi rada guess wen him find himself docked inna dat deh queer fashion, him ago sneak off widout di poor satisfaction a feeling him tail between him legs.”</p>
<p>“An weh yuh a go do wid di tail, Stubb?”</p>
<p>“Du wid it? Sel it fi a ox whip wen wi reach home;—weh else?”</p>
<p>“Now, yuh mean weh yuh seh, an weh yuh a seh all along, Stubb?”</p>
<p>“Mean or not mean, yahso wi deh a di ship.”</p>
<p>Di boats dem did deh yah, fi tow di whale pan di larboard side, weh fluke chains an other necessaries did already prepare fi secure him.</p>
<p>“Mi neva tell yuh so?” Flask seh; “yes, yuh wi soon si dis right whale head hoisted up opposite dat deh parmacetti's.”</p>
<p>Inna good time, Flask's saying prove true. As before, di Pequod steeply lean ova towards di sperm whale head, now, by di counterpoise a both heads, she regain har even keel; though sorely strained, yuh may well believe. So, wen pan one side yuh hoist inna Locke head, yuh go ova dat deh way; but now, pan di ada side, hoist in Kant's an yuh come back again; but inna very poor plight. So, some minds fi eva keep trimming boat. Oh, unu foolish! throw all dem thunder-heads deh ovaboard, an den yuh wi float light an right.</p>
<p>In disposing a di body a one right whale, wen dem bring it alongside di ship, di same preliminary proceedings commonly tek place as inna di case a one sperm whale; only, inna di latter instance, di head get cut off whole, but inna di fos di lips an tongue get separately tek weh an hoist pan deck, wid all di well known black bone attached to weh dem call di crown-piece. But notn like dis, inna di present case, neva did done. Di carcases a di two whales dem did drop astern; an di head-laden ship not a likkle resembled a mule carrying a pair a overburdening panniers.</p>
<p>Meantime, Fedallah did a calmly eyeing di right whale head, an ever an anon glancing fram di deep wrinkles deh to di lines inna him own han. An Ahab chance so fi stan up, dat di Parsee occupied him shadow; while, if di Parsee's shadow did deh deh at all it did look like only fi blend wid, an lengthen Ahab's. As di crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations did a bandied mongst dem, concerning all dem passing tings.</p>
