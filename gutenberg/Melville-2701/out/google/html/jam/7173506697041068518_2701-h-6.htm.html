<p>Some days pass, an ice an icebergs all astern, di Pequod now goh rolling thru di bright Quito spring, weh, at sea, almost perpetually reign pan di threshold a di eternal August a di Tropic. Di warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, was as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up—flaked up, wid rose-water snow. Di starred an stately nights dem did look haughty dames inna jeweled velvets, nursing at home inna lonely pride, di memory a dem absent conquering Earls, di golden helmeted suns! Fi sleeping man, 'twas hard fi choose between such winsome days an such seducing nights. But all di witcheries a dat deh unwaning weather neva merely lend new spells an potenties to di outward world. Inward dem turn pan di soul, especially wen di still mild hours a eve come on; den, memory shot har crystals as di clear ice most forms a noiseless twilights. An all dem subtle agencies deh, more an more dem did a work pan Ahab's texture.</p>
<p>Old age is always wakeful; as if, di longer linked wid life, di less man have fi do wid aught weh look like death. Among sea-commanders, di old greybeards dem will oftenest lef dem berths fi visit di night-cloaked deck. A so it did go wid Ahab; only dat now, a late, him did look so much fi live inna di open air, dat truly speaking, him visits dem did more to di cabin, dan fram di cabin to di planks. “It feel like going dung inna one's tomb,”—im woulda mutter to himself—“fi an ole captain like mi fi be descending dis narrow scuttle, fi go to mi grave-dug berth.”</p>
<p>So, almost every twenty-four hours, wen di watch dem a di night did set, an di band pan deck sentinelled di slumbers a di band below; an wen if a rope did fi be haul pan di forecastle, di sailors dem fling it not rudely dung, as by day, but wid some cautiousness dem drop it to it place fi fear fi disturb dem slumbering shipmates; wen dis sort a steady quietude woulda staat fi prevail, habitually, di silent steersman woulda watch di cabin-scuttle; an ere long di uol man woulda come out, gripping at di iron banister, fi help him crippled way. Some considering touch a humanity did deh inna him; fi at times like dem yah, him usually abstain fram patrolling di quarter-deck; cause to him wearied mates, seeking repose widin six inches a him ivory heel, such woulda been di reverberating crack an din a dat deh bony step, dat dem dreams woulda been pan di crunching teet a sharks. But once, di mood did deh pan him too deep fi common regardings; an as wid heavy, lumber-like pace him did a measure di ship fram taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, di old second mate, come up fram below, wid a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted seh if Captain Ahab did pleased fi walk di planks, den, nobadi coulda seh nay; but it might be some way fi muffle di noise; hinting someting indistinctly an hesitatingly bout a globe a tow, an di insertion inna it, a di ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, yuh neva know Ahab den.</p>
<p>“A cannon-ball mi, Stubb,” seh Ahab, “dat yuh woulda wad mi dat fashion? But go yuh ways; mi did forget. Below to yuh nightly grave; weh such as yuh sleep between shrouds, fi use yuh to di filling one at last.—Down, dog, an kennel!”</p>
<p>Startin at di unforseen concluding exclamation a di so suddenly scornful old man, Stubb did speechless a moment; den seh excitedly, “Mi no use to be talk to dat way, sa; mi do but less dan half like it, sa.”</p>
<p>“Avast! grit Ahab between him set teet, an violently move weh, as if him did a avoid some passionate temptation.</p>
<p>“No, sa; not yet,” Stubb seh, emboldened, “Mi naa go tamely be called a dog, sa.”</p>
<p>“Den be call ten times a donkey, an a mule, an an ass, an begone, or mi wi clear di world a yuh!”</p>
<p>As him seh dis, Ahab advance pan him wid such overbearing terrors inna him aspect, dat Stubb involuntarily retreat.</p>
<p>“Mi neva get sorv so bifuo widout gi a haad blow fi it,” Stubb mutter, az im fain imself a go dong di cabin-scuttle. “It very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, mi no well know weda fi go back an strike him, or—weh dat?—dung yah pan mi knees an pray fi him? Yes, dat was di thought a come up inna mi; but it woulda be di first time mi eva <i>did</i> pray. It queer; an him tek queer; yes, an him too queer; bout di queerest uol man Stubb eva sail wid.—im yai dem laik powder-pans im mad? di steward, tell mi seh a one morning him always find di ole man's hammock clothes all rumpled an tumbled, an di sheets dem dung at di foot, an di coverlid almost tie inna knots, an di pillow a sort a frightful hot, as if a baked brick did deh pan it? A hot old man! kain a Tic-Dolly-row dem seh—worse nor a toothache. Well, well; mi no know weh it is, but di Lord keep mi fram catch it. queer, now? But no telling, a di old game—Here goes fi a snooze. Bot dat gens mi prinsipl dem.An sliip wen yu kyan, a mi twelfth— <i>So</i> yaso <i>go</i> agen. observe it, mi did so tek all aback wid him brow, somehow. It flash like a bleached bone. Weh di devil's di matter wid mi? Coming afoul of dat deh old man have a sort of turn mi wrong side out. By di Lord, how it go so? fi hammock again; an inna di morning, mi ago see how dis plaguey juggling tink ova by daylight.”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00035">CHAPTER 30. Di Pipe.</h2>
<p>Wen Stubb did lef, Ahab did stan up fi a while an did a lean ova di bulwarks; an den, as was usual wid him a late, calling a sailor of di watch, him sen him dung fi him ivory stool, an also him pipe. Lighting di pipe at di binnacle lamp an planting di stool pan di weather side a di deck, him sidong an smoke.</p>
<p>Inna old Norse times, di thrones a di sea-loving Danish kings dem did mek, seh tradition, a di tusks a di narwhale. How one coulda look pon Ahab den, sidong pan dat deh tripod a bones, widout bethinking him a di royalty it symbolized? For a Khan a di plank, an a king a di sea, an a great lord a Leviathans was Ahab.</p>
<p>Som moments pass, during which di thick vapor come fram him mout inna quick an constant puffs, weh blow back again inna him face. “How now,” him soliloquize at last, widdrawing di tube, “dis smoking no longer soothes. Oh, mi pipe! hard haad it go wid mi if thy charm be gone! Yahso mi been unconsciously toiling, not pleasure—aye, an ignorantly smoking to windward all di while; to windward all di while; whale, mi final jets dem was di strongest an fullest a trouble. Weh business mi have wid dis pipe?</p>
<p>Him fling di still lighted pipe inna di sea. Di fire did a hiss inna di waves; di same instant di ship shot by di bubble di sinking pipe mek. Wid slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced di planks.</p>

<p>Neks maanin Stubb accosted Flask.</p>
<p>“Such a queer dream, King-Post, mi neva have. Yuh know di old man's ivory leg, well mi did dream him kick mi wid it; an wen mi did a try kick back, upon mi soul, mi likkle man, mi kick mi leg right off! An den, presto! Ahab did look like a pyramid, an mi, like a blazing fool, but did still a kick it more. Flask—yuh know how curious all dreams are—thru all dis rage weh mi did inna, mi somehow did a tink to miself, dat afta all, it was not much a insult, dat kick fram Ahab, 'Why,' mi tink, 'weh di row? A nuh real leg, only a false leg.' An a big difference deh between a living thump an a dead thump. Dat a weh mek a blow fram di han, Flask, fifty times more savage fi bear dan a blow fram a cane Di living member—dat mek di living insult, mi likkle man—An tink mi to miself all di while, mind, wile mi did a stubbing against mi silly tosoid. confoundedly contradictory was it all, all di while, mi seh, mi did a tink to miself, 'weh a him leg now, but a cane—a whalebone cane,' tink mi, 'it was only a playful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning weh him gi mi—not a base kick. Besides, mi tink it pan di ence; it—di foot part—weh a likkle sort a end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kick mi, <i>deh</i> a devilish broad insult But dis insult is whittled dung to a point only.' But now come di greatest joke a di dream, Flask. While mi did a batter weh at di pyramid, a sort a badger-haired old merman, wid a hump pan him back, tek mi by di shoulda dem, an slew mi round. seh him. Slid! man, but mi did fraid so! seh mi at last. 'An weh business dat a yuh, mi shuda like fi know, Mr. Humpback <i>Yuh</i> waan a kick?' By di lord, Flask, mi neva sooner seh dat, dan him turn roun him stern to mi, bent ova, an a drag up a lot a seaweed weh him did have fi a clout—weh yuh tink, mi si?—why thunder alive, man, him stern did stuck full a marlinspikes, wid di points dem out, mi seh, mi tink's secan. kick yuh, old fellow.' 'Wise Stubb,' him seh, 'wise Stubb;' an keep a mutter it all di time, a sort a eating a him own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing him neva did a go stop seh ova him 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' mi did tink seh mi might as well fall to kick di pyramid again, wen him did a roar out, 'Stop dat! 'Halloa,' mi seh, 'weh a gwaan now, uol fellow?' 'Luk yu ya,' im se; 'mek wi aagyu bout di insult we Kaptan Ahab kik yu, no chruu?' 'Yes, him did,' seh mi—'right <i>yah</i> it did deh.' 'Very good,' him seh—'im use him ivory leg, noh true?' 'Yes, him did,' seh I. 'Well den,' seh Stubb, weh yuh have fi complain bout? It wasn't a common pine leg him kick wid, is it? No, yuh did get kick by a great man, an wid a honor Stubb; Lisn, wise Stubb. Inna di greatest lords <i>dem</i> tink it <i>great</i> fi get slap by a queen, an mek yuh garter-knights; Yuh nuh see dat deh pyramid?' Wid dat, him all a sudden look like somehow, inna some queer fashion, fi swim off inna di air mi snored ova;</p>
<p>“Mi nuh know; it look like a sort a foolish to mi, though.'”</p>
<p>“May be; may be. But it mek a wise man a mi, Flask. D'ye see Ahab standing deh, sideways looking ova di stern? Well, di bes ting yuh can do, Flask, is fi mek di old man alone; neva speak to him, whatever him seh. Halloa! Weh dat him shout? Hark!”</p>
<p>“Maast-hed, de!Luk shaap, aal a unu!A wail animal de ya-so!</p>
<p>“If yuh see a white one, split yuh lungs fi him!</p>
<p>“Weh yuh tink bout dat now, Flask? Ain't deh a likkle drop a someting queer bout dat, eh? A white whale—did yuh mark dat, man? Look yuh—dem deh someting special inna di wind. Stand by fi it, Flask. Ahab have dat weh bloody pan him mind. But, mum; him come dis way.”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00037">CHAPTER 32. Cetology.</h2>
<p>Already wi boldly launch pan di deep; but soon wi ago be lost inna it unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere dat come to pass; ere di Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side wid di barnacled hulls a di leviathan; at di outset it is but well fi attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding a di more special leviathanic revelations an allusions a all sorts weh a go follow.</p>
<p>A some systematized exhibition a di whale inna him broad genera, weh mi woulda now fain put before yuh. Yet a nuh easy task. Di classification a di constituents a one chaos, notn less is yah essayed. Lisn tu weh di bes an laas aatariti dem put dong.</p>
<p>“No branch a Zoology no so much involve as dat weh dem call Cetology,” seh Captain Scoresby, AD 1820.</p>
<p>“It a nuh mi intention, if it inna mi power, fi enter inna di inquiry as to di true method fi divide di cetacea inna groups an families. * * * Utter confusion exists among di historians a dis animal” (sperm whale), seh Surgeon Beale, AD 1839.</p>
<p>“Unfitness fi pursue wi research inna di unfathomable waters.” “Impenetrable veil covering wi knowledge a di cetacea.” “A field weh full a thorns.” “All dem incomplete indications but serve fi torture wi naturalists.”</p>
<p>So speak bout di whale, di great Cuvier, an John Hunter, an Lesson, dem deh lights a zoology an anatomy. Nevertheless, though a real knowledge deh deh likkle, yet a books deh a plenty; an so inna some likkle degree, wid cetology, or di science a whales. Nof a di man dem, likl an big, uol an nyuu, lansman an siman, uu av at laaj ar likl, rait bout di wail animal. Run ova a few:—Di Authors a di Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; di Author a Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; an di Rev. T. Cheever. But to weh ultimate generalizing purpose all dem yah write, di above cited extracts ago show.</p>
<p>Outa di niem dem inna dis list a whale aata dem, ongl dem weh fala Owen eva si livin whale; an but one a dem was a real professional harpooneer an whaleman. Mi mean Captain Scoresby. Pan di separate subject a di Greenland or right-whale, him a di bes existing authority. But Scoresby neva know nutten an neva seh nutten bout di great sperm whale, compared wid which di Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. An yahso be it seh, dat di Greenland whale a one usurper pan di throne a di seas. Im no even di largest a di whales dem. Yet, owing to di long priority a him claims, an di profound ignorance weh, til some seventy years back, invest di den fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, an weh ignorance to dis present day still reign in all but some few scientific retreats an whale-ports; dis usurpation don every way complete. Reference to nearly all di leviathanic allusions inna di great poets a past days, will satisfy yuh seh di Greenland whale, widout one rival, was to dem di monarch a di seas. But di time don come fi a new proclamation. Dis a Charing Cross; hear unu! good people all,—di Greenland whale get deposed,—di great sperm whale a reign now!</p>
<p>A only two books inna being weh at all pretend fi put di living sperm whale before yuh, an at di same time, inna di remotest degree succeed inna di attempt. Dem deh book deh a Beale's an Bennett's; both inna dem time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, an both exact an reliable man. Di original matter weh touch di sperm whale fi find inna dem volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it go, it is a excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, di sperm whale, scientific or poetic, live not complete inna no literature. Far above all ada hunted whales, him a one unwritten life.</p>
<p>Now di various species a whales need some sort a popular comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one fi di present, hereafter fi be filled in all its departments by subsequent labourers. As no better man advance fi tek dis matter inna han, mi hereupon offer mi own poor endeavors. Mi promise nutten complete; cause any human ting weh suppose to be complete, must fi dat very reason infallibly be faulty. Mi naa go pretend fi a minute anatomical description a di various species, or—inna dis place at least—to much a any description. Mi object yah is simply fi project di draft a one systematization a cetology. Mi a di architect, not di builder.</p>
<p>But it a one ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter inna di Post-Office no equal to it. Fi grope dung inna di bottom a di sea afta dem; fi have one's hands mongst di unspeakable foundations, ribs, an very pelvis a di worl; dis a one fearful ting. Weh mi is dat mi shuda essay fi hook di nose a dis leviathan! Di awful tauntings inna Job might well appal mi. Him (di leviathan) ago mek a covenant wid yuh? Behold di hope a him vain! But mi swim thru libraries an sail thru oceans; Mi have fi do wid whales wid dem visible hands deh; Mi deh inna earnest; an mi ago try. Som preliminaries deh fi settle.</p>
<p>Fos: Di uncertain, unsettled condition a dis science a Cetology deh inna di very vestibule attested by di fact, dat inna some quarters it still remain a moot point weda a whale be a fish. Inna him System of Nature, AD 1776, Linnæus declare, “Mi hereby separate di whales fram di fish.” But a mi own knowledge, mi know seh dong to di year 1850, sharks an shad, alewives an herring, against Linnæus's express edikt, did still find dividing di possession a di same seas wid di Leviathan.</p>
<p>Di grounds pan weh Linnæus woulda fain banish di whales dem fram di waters, him seh as follows: “Pan account a dem warm bilocular heart, dem lungs, dem movable eyelids, dem hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” an finally, “ex lege naturæ jure merittoque.” Mi submit all dis to mi fren dem Simeon Macey an Charley Coffin, a Nantucket, both a mi messmates inna a certain voyage, an dem united inna di opinion seh di reasons dem weh dem did set out neva sufficient. Charley profanely hinted dem was humbug.</p>
<p>Be it known dat, waiving all argument, mi tek di good old fashioned ground dat di whale a one fish, an call pan holy Jonah fi back mi. Dis fundamental ting settled, di next point is, in what internal respect do di whale differ fram other fish. Above, Linnæus gi yuh dem deh items deh. But in brief, dem a dem ya: lungs an warm blood; whereas, all di ada fish dem lungless an cold blood.</p>
<p>Next: how wi fi define di whale, by him obvious externals, so as conspicuously fi label him fi all time to come? Fi be short, den, a whale is <i>a spouting fish wid a horizontal tail</i> . A deh so yuh have him. However contracted, dat deh definition a di result a expanded meditation. A walrus spout much like a whale, but di walrus a nuh fish, cause him amphibious. But di laas term a di definition stil more cogent, as coupled wid di fos. Almost any one mosi did notice seh all di fish dem weh landsmen know have nuh a flat, but a vertical, or up-an-down tail. Whereas, mongst spouting fish di tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assume a horizontal position.</p>
<p>By di above definition a weh a whale is, mi do by no means exclude fram di leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identify wid di whale by di bes informed Nantucketers; nor, pan di ada han, link wid it any fish weh hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* So, all di smaller, spouting, an horizontal tailed fish dem haffi be included inna dis ground-plan a Cetology. Now, den, come di grand divisions a di entire whale host.</p>
<p>*Mi know seh dong to di present time, di fish dem weh dem style Lamatins an Dugongs (Pig-fish an Sow-fish a di Coffins a Nantucket) dem include by plenty naturalists mongst di whales. But as dem pig-fish yah a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking inna di mout a rivers, an feeding pan wet hay, an especially as dem nuh spout, mi deny dem credentials as whales; an don present dem wid dem passports fi quit di Kingdom of Cetology.</p>
<p>Fos: According to magnitude mi divide di whales dem inna three primary BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), an dem shall comprehend dem all, both small an large.</p>
<p>I. DI FOLIO WHALE; II. di OCTAVO WHALE; III. di DUODECIMO WHALE.</p>
<p>As di type a di FOLIO mi present di <i>Sperm Whale</i> ; a di OCTAVO, di <i>Grampus</i> ; a di DUODECIMO, di <i>Porpoise</i> .</p>
<p>FOLIOS. Among dem mi yah include di following chapters:—I. Di <i>Sperm Whale</i> ; II. di <i>Right Whale</i> ; III. di <i>Fin-Back Whale</i> ; IV. di <i>Hump-backed Whale</i> ; V. di <i>Razor Back Whale</i> ; VI. di <i>Sulphur Bottom Whale</i> .</p>
<p>BOOK I. ( <i>Folio</i> ), CHAPTER I. ( <i>Sperm Whale</i> ).—Dis whale, mongst di English dem a uol taim vaguely known as di Trumpa whale, an di Physeter whale, an di Anvil Headed whale, a di present Cachalot a di French, an di Pottsfich a di Germans, an di Macrocelus a di Long Words. Im a, widout doubt, di largest inhabitant a di globe; di most formidable a all whales fi encounter; di most majestic inna aspect; an lastly, by far di most valuable inna commerce; im a di ongl creature fram weh dat valuable substance, spermaceti, get fram. All him peculiarities will, inna many ada places, be enlarged upon. A chiefly wid him name weh mi haffi do now. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Som centuries ago, wen di Sperm whale did almost wholly unknown inna him own proper individuality, an wen him oil did only accidentally obtained fram di stranded fish; inna dem days spermaceti, it woulda seem, was popularly suppose to be derived from a creature identical wid di one den known in England as di Greenland or Right Whale. A did di idea too, seh dis same spermaceti was dat quickening humor a di Greenland Whale weh di first syllable a di wod literally express. Inna dem time deh, also, spermaceti did exceedingly scarce, dem neva use fi light, but only as an ointment an medicament. It was only fi be get fram di druggists as yuh nowadays buy an ounce a rhubarb. Wen, as mi opinion, inna di course a time, di true nature a spermaceti did get known, di original name did still retain by di dealers; no doubt fi enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant a its scarcity. An so di appellation mus at last did come fi bestowed upon di whale fram weh dis spermaceti did really derived.</p>
<p>BOOK I. ( <i>Folio</i> ), CHAPTER II. ( <i>Right Whale</i> ).—In one respect dis a di most venerable a di leviathans, being di one first regularly hunted by man. It yield di article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; an di oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article inna commerce. Among di fisherman dem, him get indiscriminately designated by all di following titles: Di Whale; di Greenland Whale; di Black Whale; di Great Whale; di True Whale; di Right Whale. Deh have a deal a obscurity concerning di identity a di species thus multitudinously baptised. Weh den a di whale, weh mi include inna di secan species a mi Folios? A di Great Mysticetus a di English naturalists; di Greenland Whale a di English whalemen; di Baleine Ordinaire a di French whalemen; di Growlands Walfish a di Swedes. A di whale weh fi more dan two centuries past did a hunt by di Dutch an English inna di Arctic seas; a di whale weh di American fisherman dem did a pursue inna di Indian ocean, pan di Brazil Banks, pan di Nor' West Coast, an various ada parts a di worl, weh dem designate by Right Whale Cruising Grounds.</p>
<p>Som pretend fi si a difference between di Greenland whale a di English an di right whale a di Americans. But dem precisely agree inna all dem grand features; nor have yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. A by endless subdivisions based upon di most inconclusive differences, dat some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. Di right whale ago be elsewhere treated of at some length, wid reference to elucidating di sperm whale.</p>
<p>BOOK I. ( <i>Folio</i> ), CHAPTER III. ( <i>Fin-Back</i> ).—Under dis head mi reckon a monster weh, by di various names a Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, an Long-John, don si almost inna every sea an is commonly di whale whose distant jet is so often described by passengers crossing di Atlantic, inna di New York packet-tracks. Inna di length weh him get, an inna him baleen, di Fin-back resemble di right whale, but it a less portly girth, an a lighter colour, approaching to olive. Him great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by di intertwisting, slanting folds a large wrinkles. Him grand distinguishing feature, di fin, fram weh him get him name, is often a conspicuous object. Dis fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically fram di hinder part a di back, a one angular shape, an wid a very sharp pointed end. Even if not di slightest ada part a di creature be visible, dis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. Wen di sea moderately calm, an slightly marked wid spherical ripples, an dis gnomon-like fin stan up an cast shadows upon di wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed dat di watery circle surrounding it somewhat resemble a dial, wid it style an wavy hour-lines graved pan it. Pan dat deh Ahaz-dial di shadow often go back. Di Fin-Back a nuh gregarious. Im look like a whale-hater, as some man dem a man-hater. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to di surface inna di remotest an most sullen waters; him straight an single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted wid such wondrous power an velocity inna swimming, as fi defy all present pursuit fram man; dis leviathan seems di banished an unconquerable Cain a him race, bearing fi him mark dat deh style pan him back. Fram him have di baleen inna him mout, di Fin-Back is sometimes included wid di right whale, mongst a theoretic species denominated <i>Whalebone whales</i> , dat is, whales wid baleen. Outa dem so called Whalebone whales, it woulda look like dem have several varieties, most a dem, however, dem likkle known. Broad-nosed whales an beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales an rostrated whales, a di fisherman's names fi a few sorts.</p>
<p>In connection wid dis appellative a “Whalebone whales,” it is a great importance fi mention, dat however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain fi attempt a clear classification a di Leviathan, founded upon either him baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding dat dem marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted fi afford di basis fi a regular system a Cetology dan any ada detached bodily distinctions, weh di whale, inna him kinds, present. How den? Di baleen, hump, back-fin, an teet; dem a tings weh dem peculiarities dem indiscriminately dispersed mongst all sorts a whales, widout any regard to weh may be di nature a dem structure inna other an more essential particulars. So, di sperm whale an di humpbacked whale, each have a hump; but deh deh di similitude stop. Den, dis same humpbacked whale an di Greenland whale, each a dem have baleen; but deh again di similitude stop. An it jus di same wid di ada parts dem weh mi mention above. Inna various sorts a whales, dem form such irregular combinations; or, inna di case a any one a dem detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly fi defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. Pan dis rock every one a di whale-naturalists dem split.</p>
<p>But it may possibly be conceived dat, inna di internal parts a di whale, inna him anatomy—de, at least, wi shall be able fi hit di right classification. No; weh ting, fi egzampl, deh inna di Greenland whale's anatomy weh more striking dan him baleen? Yet wi don si seh by him baleen it impossible correctly fi classify di Greenland whale. An if yuh descend inna di bowels a di various leviathans, why deh yuh naa go find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to di systematizer as dem external ones already enumerated. Weh den lef? notn but fi tek hold a di whales dem bodyly, inna dem entire liberal volume, an boldly sort dem dat way. An dis a di Bibliographical system weh dem adopt yah; an a di ongl wan weh can possibly succeed, fi it alone is practicable. Fi proceed.</p>
<p>BOOK I. ( <i>Folio</i> ) CHAPTER IV. ( <i>Hump Back</i> ).—Dis whale is often seen pan di northern American coast. Dem did kech him deh, an dem did tow him inna harbor. Him have a great pack pan him like a peddler; or yuh might call him di Elephant an Castle whale. At any rate, di popular name fi him nuh sufficiently distinguish him, since di sperm whale also have a hump though a smaller one. Him oil nuh very valuable. Him have baleen. Im a di most gamesome an light-hearted a all di whales, im mek more gay foam an white water generally dan any ada a dem.</p>
<p>BOOK I. ( <i>Folio</i> ), CHAPTER V. ( <i>Razor Back</i> ).—Of dis whale likkle bit is known but him name. Mi si him a distance fram Cape Horn. Of a retiring nature, him eludes both hunters an philosophers. Though no coward, him neva yet show no part a him but him back, weh rise inna a long sharp ridge. Mek him go. Mi know likkle more a him, nor nobody else.</p>
<p>BOOK I. ( <i>Folio</i> ), CHAPTER VI. ( <i>Sulphur Bottom</i> ).—Anoda retiring gentleman, wid a brimstone belly, doubtless get by scraping along di Tartarian tiles inna some a him profounder divings. Nobadi neva si him; at least mi neva si him except inna di remoter southern seas, an den always at too great a distance fi study him countenance. Dem neva chase him; him woulda run weh wid rope-walks a line. Prodigies dem tell bout him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! Mi cyan seh notn more weh true bout yuh, nor can di oldest Nantucketer.</p>
<p>So end BOOK I. ( <i>Folio</i> ), an now staat BOOK II. ( <i>Octavo</i> ).</p>
<p>OCTAVOES.*—Dem embrace di whales dem a middling magnitude, among which present may be numbered:—I., di <i>Grampus</i> ; II., di <i>Black Fish</i> ; III., di <i>Narwhale</i> ; IV., di <i>Thrasher</i> ; V., di <i>Killer</i> .</p>
<p>*Why dis book a whales no denominate di Quarto is very plain. Bikaaz, while di whales dem a dis order, though smaala dan dem a di fos order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to dem inna figure, yet di bookbinder's Quarto volume inna it dimensioned form no preserve di shape a di Folio volume, but di Octavo volume does.</p>
<p>BOOK II. ( <i>Octavo</i> ), CHAPTER I. ( <i>Grampus</i> ).—Though dis fish, whose loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, have furnish a proverb to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is him not popularly classed among whales. But possessing all di grand distinctive features a di leviathan, most naturalists have recognize him fi one. Im a moderate octavo size, varying fram fifteen to twenty-five feet inna length, an a corresponding dimensions roun di waist. Him swim inna herds; dem neva hunt him regularly, though him oil is considerable inna quantity, an pretty good fi light. By some fishermen him approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.</p>
<p>BOOK II. ( <i>Octavo</i> ), CHAPTER II. ( <i>Black Fish</i> ).—Mi gi di popular fishermen dem name fi all dem fish yah, fi generally dem a di bes. Weh any name happen fi be vague or inexpressive, mi shall seh so, an suggest anodda one. Mi do so now, touching di Black Fish, so-called, cause blackness a di rule mongst almost all whales. So, call him di Hyena Whale, if yuh please. Him voracity is well known, an fram di circumstance dat di inner angles a him lips dem curve upwards, him carry an everlasting Mephistophelean grin pan him face. Dis whale average some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. Him deh inna almost all latitudes. Im have a peculiar way fi show im dorsal hooked fin inna swimming, weh look someting like a Roman nose. Wen dem no more profitably employed, di sperm whale hunters dem sometimes capture di Hyena whale, fi keep up di supply a cheap oil fi domestic employment—as some frugal housekeepers, inna di absence a company, an quite alone by demself, burn unsavory tallow instead a odorous wax. Though dem blubber very thin, some a dem whales yah ago gi yuh upwards a thirty gallons a oil.</p>
<p>BOOK II. ( <i>Octavo</i> ), CHAPTER III. ( <i>Narwhale</i> ), dat is, <i>Nostril whale</i> .—Anoda instance a one curiously named whale, so named mi suppose fram him peculiar horn weh did originally mistaken fi a peaked nose. Di creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, an even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, dis horn a jus a lengthened tusk, growing out fram di jaw inna a line a likkle depressed fram di horizontal. But it only find pan di sinister side, weh have an ill effect, giving it owna someting analogous to di aspect a one clumsy left-handed man. Weh precise purpose dis ivory horn or lance ansa, it woulda be hard fi seh. It no look like dem use it like di blade a di sword-fish an bill-fish; though some sailors tell mi seh di Narwhale employ it fi a rake inna turning ova di bottom a di sea fi food. Charley Coffin seh dem did use it fi an ice-piercer; fi di Narwhale, rising to di surface a di Polar Sea, an find it sheeted wid ice, thrust him horn up, an so break through. But yuh cyaan prove non a dem surmises yah fi be correct. Mi own opinion is, dat however dis one-sided horn may really be used by di Narwhale—however dat may be—it woulda certainly be very convenient to him fi a folder inna reading pamphlets. Di Narwhale mi hear dem call di Tusked whale, di Horned whale, an di Unicorn whale. Im a certainly a curious example a di Unicornism weh yuh find inna almost every kingdom a animated nature. Fram certain cloistered old authors mi have gathered seh dis same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as di great antidote against poison, an as such, preparations of it bring immense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts fi fainting ladies, di same way how di horns a di male deer dem mek inna hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tell mi seh Sir Martin Frobisher pan him return fram dat deh voyage, wen Queen Bess did gallantly wave har jeweled han to him fram a window a Greenwich Palace, as him bold ship did a sail dung di Thames; “wen Sir Martin did come back fram dat deh voyage,” seh Black Letter, “pan bend knees him did present to har highness a prodigious long horn a di Narwhale, weh fi a long period afta did hang inna di castle at Windsor.” An Irish author avers seh di Earl of Leicester, pan bended knees, did likewise present to har highness anodda horn, pertaining to a land beast of di unicorn nature.</p>
<p>Di Narwhale have a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being a milk-white ground colour, dotted wid round an oblong spots a black. Him oil very superior, clear an fine; but a likkle a it deh, an dem seldom hunt him. Im mostly find inna di circumpolar seas.</p>
<p>BOOK II. ( <i>Octavo</i> ), CHAPTER IV. ( <i>Killer</i> ).—Of dis whale likkle is precisely known to di Nantucketer, an nutten at all to di professed naturalist. Fram weh mi si a him a distance, mi shuda seh dat him did bout di bigness a one grampus. Im very savage—a sort a Feegee fish. Im sometimes tek di great Folio whales dem by di lip, an hang deh like a leech, til di mighty brute worried to death. Di Killer neva get hunt. Mi neva ier wa kaina ail im av. Exception might be taken to di name bestowed upon dis whale, pan di ground a it indistinctness. Kaaz aal a wi a kil, pan lan an pan sii; Bonapartes an Sharks included.</p>
<p>BOOK II. ( <i>Octavo</i> ), CHAPTER V. ( <i>Thrasher</i> ).—Dis gentleman is famous fi him tail, weh him use fi a ferule inna thrashing him foes. Im mount di Folio whale's back, an as im swim, im work im passage by flogging im; as some schoolmasters get along inna di world by a similar process. Stil less is known bout di Thrasher dan bout di Killer. Both a outlaws, even inna di lawless seas.</p>
<p>So BOOK II end. ( <i>Octavo</i> ), an staat BOOK III. ( <i>Duodecimo</i> ).</p>
<p>DUODECIMOES.—Dem include di smaller whales. I. Di Huzza Porpoise. II. Di Algerine Porpoise. III. Di Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.</p>
<p>Tu dem who neva chance specially fi study di subject, it may possibly seem strange, dat fish dem weh nuh commonly exceed four or five feet shuda be marshal mongst WHALES—a wod, weh, inna di popular sense, always convey an idea a hugeness. But di creatures dem weh set dung above as Duodecimoes a infallibly whales, by di terms a mi definition a weh a whale is— <i>ie</i> a spouting fish, wid a horizontal tail.</p>
<p>BOOK III. ( <i>Duodecimo</i> ), CHAPTER 1. ( <i>Huzza Porpoise</i> ).—Dis a di common porpoise weh yuh find almost all ova di globe. Di name a fi mi own bestowal; kaa deh have more dan one sort a porpoises, an someting haffi do fi distinguish dem. Mi call him so, cause him always swim inna hilarious shoals, weh pan di broad sea keep tossing demself to heaven like caps inna a Fourth-of-July crowd. Dem appearance is generally hailed wid delight by di mariner. Full a fine spirits, dem invariably come fram di breezy billows to windward. Dem a di lads dem weh always live before di wind. Dem consider dem a lucky omen. If yuhself can stan three cheers at beholding dem vivacious fish, den heaven help yuh; di spirit a godly gamesomeness no deh inna yuh. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise ago gi yuh one good gallon a good oil. But di fine an delicate fluid weh dem tek outa him jaws is exceedingly valuable. It deh inna request mongst jewelers an watchmakers. Sailors put it pan dem hones. Porpoise meat is good eating, yuh know. It may neva come to yuh seh a porpoise spouts. Indeed, him spout so small dat it nuh very readily discernible. Bot di neks taim yu av a chaans, wach im; an yuh wi den si di great Sperm whale himself inna miniature.</p>
<p>BOOK III. ( <i>Duodecimo</i> ), CHAPTER II. ( <i>Algerine Porpoise</i> ).—A pirate. Very savage. Im only deh, mi tink, inna di Pacific. Im is somewhat larger dan di Huzza Porpoise, but much a di same general mek. Provoke him, an him ago buckle to a shark. Mi don lower fi him plenty times, but neva yet si him captured.</p>
<p>BOOK III. ( <i>Duodecimo</i> ), CHAPTER III. ( <i>Mealy-mouthed Porpoise</i> ).—Di biggis kain a Porpoise; an only find inna di Pacific, so far as it is known. Di ongl English name, weh him get designate so far, a di fishers dem—Right-Whale Porpoise, fram di circumstance dat him chiefly find inna di vicinity a dat deh Folio. Inna shape, him differ in some degree fram di Huzza Porpoise, being a less rotund an jolly girth; indeed, him is a quite neat an gentleman-like figure. Im no have no fins pan im back (most ada porpoises have), im have a lovely tail, an sentimental Indian eyes a hazel hue. But him mealy-mouth spoil all. Though him entire back dung to him side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as di mark inna a ship's hull, call di “bright waist,” dat line streak him fram stem to stern, wid two separate colours, black above an white below. Di white comprise part a him head, an di whole a him mout, weh mek him look like him did jus escape fram a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean an mealy aspect! Him oil is much like dat a di common porpoise.</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>Beyond di DUODECIMO, dis system no proceed, inasmuch as di Porpoise a di smallest a di whales. Aafa, yuh have all di Leviathans a note. But deh deh a rabble a uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, weh, as an American whaleman, mi know by reputation, but not personally. Mi ago enumerate dem by dem fore-castle appellations; fi possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may complete weh mi have yah but began. If any a di following whales, shall hereafter be caught an marked, den him can readily be incorporated into dis System, according to him Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—Di Bottle-Nose Whale; di Junk Whale; di Pudding-Headed Whale; di Cape Whale; di Leading Whale; di Cannon Whale; di Scragg Whale; di Coppered Whale; di Elephant Whale; di Iceberg Whale; di Quog Whale; di Blue Whale; etc. Fram Icelandic, Dutch, an old English authorities, yuh might be quote ada lists a uncertain whales, blessed wid all manner a uncouth names. But mi omit dem as altogether obsolete; an can hardly help suspecting dem fi mere sounds, full a Leviathanism, but signifying notn.</p>
<p>Finally: It was stated at di outset, dat dis system wouldn't be yah, an at once, perfected. Yuh cyaan but plainly see seh mi keep mi word. But mi now lef mi cetological System standing so unfinished, even as di great Cathedral of Cologne did lef, wid di crane still standing upon di top a di uncompleted tower. Fi small erections may be finish by dem first architects; grand ones, true ones, eva lef di copestone to posterity. God keep mi fram eva complete notn. Dis whole book a jus a draft—nay, but di draft a one draft. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, an Patience!</p>
