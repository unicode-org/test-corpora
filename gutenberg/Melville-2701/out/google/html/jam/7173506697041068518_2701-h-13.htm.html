<h2 id="pgepubid00066">CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.</h2>
<p>If to Starbuck di apparition a di Squid was a ting a portents, to Queequeg it was quite a different object.</p>
<p>“Wen yuh si him 'quid,” di savage seh, a honing him harpoon inna di bow a him hoisted boat, “den yuh quick si him 'parm whale.”</p>
<p>Di neks day did exceedingly still an sultry, an wid notn special fi engage dem, di Pequod's crew coulda hardly resist di spell a sleep induced by such a vacant sea. Fi dis part a di Indian Ocean weh wi did a voyage chruu a nuh weh whalemen call a lively ground; dat mean, it afford fewer glimpses a porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, an ada vivacious denizens a more stirring waters, dan dem deh off di Rio de la Plata, or di in-shore ground off Peru.</p>
<p>A did mi turn fi stan up a di foremast-head; an wid mi shoulda dem lean gens di slackened royal shrouds, to an fro mi idly sway inna weh did look like an enchanted air. No resolution coulda stan it; inna dat deh dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last mi soul go out a mi body; though mi body still did a sway as a pendulum will, long afta di power weh did a move it fos get tek weh.</p>
<p>Ere forgetfulness altogether come ova mi, mi did notice seh di seamen dem at di main an mizzen-mast-heads did already drowsy. So dat at last all three a wi lifelessly swing fram di spars, an fi every swing weh wi mek deh did have a nod fram below fram di slumbering helmsman. Di waves dem, too, did a nod dem indolent crests; an across di wide trance a di sea, east nod to west, an di sun ova all.</p>
<p>Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting unda mi closed eyes; like vices mi han dem grab di shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserve mi; wid a shock mi come back to life. An lo! close unda wi lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay a roll inna di wata like di capsized hull a one frigate, him broad, glossy back, a one Ethiopian hue, a glistening inna di sun's rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating inna di trough a di sea, an ever an anon tranquilly spouting him vapory jet, di whale look like a portly burgher a smoke him pipe a one warm aftanuun. But dat deh pipe, poor whale, was yuh last. As if get hit by some enchanter's wand, di sleepy ship an every sleeper inna it all at once staat into wakefulness; an more dan a score a voices fram all parts a di vessel, simultaneously wid di three notes fram aloft, shout out di accustomed cry, as di great fish slowly an regularly spout di sparkling brine inna di air.</p>
<p>“Clear weh di boats dem! Luff!” Ahab baal out. An obeying him own order, him dash di helm dung before di helmsman coulda handle di spokes.</p>
<p>Di sudden exclamations a di crew mosi did alarm di whale; an ere di boat dem did dong, majestically turning, him swim weh to di leeward, but wid such a steady tranquillity, an mek so few ripples as him swim, dat thoughting afta all him might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gi orders dat not an oar should be used, an no man haffi speak but in whispers. So sidong laik Ontario Indians pan di gunwales a di boat dem, wi swiftly but silently paddled along; di calm not admitting of di noiseless sails being set. Presently, as wi thus glide inna chase, di monster perpendicularly flit him tail forty feet inna di air, an den sink outa sight like a tower swallow up.</p>
<p>“Dem go flukes!” was di cry, an announcement immediately followed by Stubb's producing him match and igniting him pipe, for now a respite was granted. Afta di full interval a him sounding did elaps, di whale rise again, an being now in advance a di smoker's boat, an much nearer to it dan to any a di others, Stubb count upon di honor a di capture. It was obvious, now, dat di whale did at length become aware a him pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles did drop, an oars did come loudly inna play. An still a puff at him pipe, Stubb cheer pan him crew to di assault.</p>
<p>Yes, a mighty change did come ova di fish. All alive to him jeopardy, him did a go “head out”; dat deh part obliquely projecting fram di mad yeast weh him brew.*</p>
<p>*It wi si inna some ada place a weh a very light substance di entire interior a di sperm whale's enormous head consist. Though apparently di most massive, it is by far di most buoyant part bout him. So dat wid ease him elevate it inna di air, an invariably do so wen him a go at him utmost speed. Besides, such is di breadth a di upper part a di front a him head, an such di tapering cut-water formation a di lower part, dat by obliquely elevating him head, him thereby may be said to transform himself fram a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.</p>
<p>“Staat ar, staat ar, mi man dem! No bada ron unuself; tek plenti taim—bot staat ar; staat ar laik tonda-klap, dat a aal,” Stubb baal out, a spluot out di sumuok az im a taak. “Start har, now; gi dem di long an strong stroke, Tashtego. Start har, Tash, mi bwoy—start har, all; but keep cool, keep cool—cucumbers is di word—easy, easy—only staat har like grim death an grinning devils, an raise di buried dead perpendicular outa dem graves, all har bwoys!”</p>
<p>“Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” scream di Gay-Header in reply, raising some old war-whoop to di skies; as every oarsman inna di strained boat involuntarily bounce forward wid di one tremendous leading stroke weh di eager Indian did gi.</p>
<p>But him wild screams dem did ansa by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee! Kee-hee!” Daggoo baal out, a strain forwards an backwards pan him seat, like a pacing tiger inna him cage.</p>
<p>“Ka-la! Koo-loo!” Queequeg howled, as if him did a smack him lips ova a mouthful a Grenadier's steak. An so wid oars an yells di keels cut di sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining him place inna di van, still encourage him man dem to di onset, all di while puffing di smoke fram him mout. Like desperadoes dem tug an dem strain, til di welcome cry did hear—“Stand up, Tashtego!—gi it to him!” Di harpoon did get fling. “Stern all!” Di oarsmen dem did a back water; di same moment someting go hot an hissing along every one a dem wrists. A did di magical line. An instant before, Stubb did swiftly ketch two additional turns wid it roun di loggerhead, weh, by reason a it increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up an mingled wid di steady fumes fram him pipe. As di line did a pass roun an roun di loggerhead; so also, jus before it reach dat deh point, it blisteringly pass through an through both a Stubb's hands, fram which di hand-cloths, or squares a quilted canvas sometimes wear at dem times deh, did accidentally drop. It was like yuh did a hold an enemy's sharp two-edged sword by di blade, an dat deh enemy all di time a try fi wrest it outa yuh clutch.</p>
<p>“Wet di line! wet di line!” Stubb baal out tu di tub oarsman (him did a sidong bai di tub) weh, snatch aaf him hat, dash sea-waata inna it.* More turns did tek, so dat di line staat hold it place. Di boat now did a fly chruu di boiling wata like a shark all fins. Stubb an Tashtego yah change places—stem fi stern—a staggering business truly inna dat deh rocking commotion.</p>
<p>*Partly fi show di indispensableness a dis act, it may yah be stated, dat, inna di old Dutch fishery, a mop did use fi dash di running line wid water; inna plenty ada ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart fi dat purpose. Yuh hat, however, a di most convenient.</p>
<p>Fram di vibrating line weh extend di entire length a di upper part a di boat, an fram it now being more tight dan a harpstring, yuh woulda tink seh di craft did have two keels—one cleaving di water, di other di air—as di boat churned on through both opposing elements at once. A continual cascade did a play at di bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy inna har wake; an, at di slightest motion fram widin, even but a likkle finga, di vibrating, cracking craft canted ova har spasmodic gunwale inna di sea. So dem rush; each man wid might an main clinging to him seat, fi prevent dem tossed to di foam; an di tall form a Tashtego at di steering oar crouching almost double, in order fi bring dung him center a gravity. Whole Atlantics an Pacifics did look like dem did pass as dem did a shot pan dem way, til at length di whale did a slack him flight.</p>
<p>“Haul in—haul in!” Stubb baal out tu di bowsman! an, face round towards di whale, all hands staat pull di boat up to him, while yet di boat did a tow on. Soon ranging up by him flank, Stubb, firmly planting him knee inna di clumsy cleat, dart dart afta dart inna di flying fish; at di word a command, di boat alternately sterning outa di way a di whale's horrible wallow, an den range up fi anodda fling.</p>
<p>Di red tide now did a pour fram all sides a di monster like brooks dung a hill. Him tormented body did a roll not inna brine but inna blood, weh did a bubble an seeth fi furlongs behind inna dem wake. Di slanting sun weh did a play pan dis crimson pond inna di sea, sen back it reflection inna every face, so dat dem all did a glow to each other like red man. An all di while, jet afta jet a white smoke did agonizingly shot fram di spiracle a di whale, an vehement puff afta puff fram di mout a di excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon him crooked lance (by di line attached to it), Stubb straighten it again an again, by a few rapid blows against di gunwale, den again an again sen it inna di whale.</p>
<p>“Pull up—pull up!” him now cry to di bowsman, as di waning whale relax inna him wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” an di boat did a range along di fish's flank. Wen him reach far ova di bow, Stubb slowly churn him long sharp lance inna di fish, an keep it deh, carefully churning an churning, as if cautiously seeking fi feel afta some gold watch weh di whale mighta did swallow, an weh him did fraid fi break ere him coulda hook it out. But dat deh gold watch weh him did a look fah was di innermost life a di fish. An now it get hit; fi, staatin fram im trance inna dat de unspeakable ting weh dem kaal im “flurry,” di monster horribly wallow inna im blood, uovawrap imself inna impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so dat di imperiled craft, instantly drop astern, did have much ado blindly fi struggle out fram dat de phrensied twilight inna di day clear.</p>
<p>An now abating inna him flurry, di whale once more roll out inna view; surging fram side to side; spasmodically dilating an contracting him spout-hole, wid sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush afta gush a clotted red gore, as if it was di purple lees a red wine, shot inna di frighted air; an falling back again, run dripping dung him motionless flanks inna di sea. Him heart did burst!</p>
<p>“Im ded, Misa Stubb,” Daggoo se.</p>
<p>“Yes; both pipes smoke out!” an tek weh him own fram him mout, Stubb scatter di dead ashes ova di wata; an, fi a moment, stan up a tinkful a luk pan di big ded badi weh im did mek.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00067">CHAPTER 62. Di Dart.</h2>
<p>A word concerning an incident inna di last chapter.</p>
<p>According to di invariable usage a di fishery, di whale-boat push off fram di ship, wid di headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman, an di harpooneer or whale-fastener a pul di foremost oar, di one weh dem call di harpooneer-oar. Now it need a strong, nervous arm fi strike di first iron inna di fish; fi often, inna weh dem call a long dart, di heavy implement haffi be fling to di distance a twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged an exhausting di chase, di harpooneer is expected fi pull him oar meanwhile to di uttermost; indeed, dem expect him fi set an example a superhuman activity to di rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud an intrepid exclamations; an weh it mean fi keep shouting at di top a one's compass, while all di ada muscles dem strain an half staat—weh dat is none know but dem who try it. Fi one, mi cyan bawl very heartily an work very recklessly at one an di same time. Inna dis straining, bawling state, den, wid him back to di fish, all at once di exhausted harpooneer hear di exciting cry—“Stand up, an give it to him!” Im now haffi drop an secure im oar, turn round pan im center half way, seize im harpoon fram di crotch, an wid weh likkle strength may remain, im essay fi pitch it somehow inna di whale. No wanda, tek di whole fleet a whalemen inna a body, dat out a fifty fair chances fi a dart, not five a successful; no wonder seh so many hapless harpooneers dem madly cursed an disrated; no wonder seh some a dem actually burst dem blood-vessels inna di boat; no wonder seh some sperm whalemen dem absent four years wid four barrels; no wonder dat to many ship owners, whaling is only a losing concern; fi it a di harpooneer weh mek di voyage, an if yuh tek di breath outa him body how yuh can expect fi find it deh wen most wanted!</p>
<p>Again, if di dart be successful, den at di secan critical instant, dat is, wen di whale staat run, di boaheader an harpooneer likewise staat run fore an aft, to di imminent jeopardy a demself an every one else. A den dem change place; an di headsman, di chief officer a di likkle craft, tek him proper station inna di bows a di boat.</p>
<p>Now, mi no care who maintain di contrary, but all dis is both foolish an unnecessary. Di headsman fi stay inna di bows fram first to last; him shuda both dart di harpoon an di lance, an no rowing whatever shuda be expected fram him, except unda circumstances obvious to any fisherman. Mi know seh dis woulda sometimes involve a slight loss a speed inna di chase; but lang experience inna various whalemen a more dan one nation don convince mi seh inna di vast majority a failures inna di fishery, it neva by any means been so much di speed a di whale as di before described exhaustion a di harpooneer weh did cause dem.</p>
<p>Fi insure di greatest efficiency inna di dart, di harpooneers dem a dis ya worl haffi staat pan dem foot fram outa idleness, an no fram outa toil.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00068">CHAPTER 63. Di Crotch.</h2>
<p>Outa di trunk, di branch dem grow; out a dem, di twigs. So, inna productive subjects, grow di chapters.</p>
<p>Di crotch weh dem did a taak bout pan a previous page deserve independent mention. A one notched stick a one peculiar form, some two feet in length, weh dem perpendicularly insert inna di starboard gunwale near di bow, fi di purpose a furnishing a rest fi di wooden extremity a di harpoon, weh di ada naked, barbed end slopingly projects fram di prow. So di weapon deh instantly at hand to it hurler, who snatch it up as readily fram it rest as a backwoodsman swing him rifle fram di wall. It is customary fi have two harpoons reposing inna di crotch, respectively called di first an secan irons.</p>
<p>But dem two harpoon yah, each wid dem own cord, dem both connect wid di line; di object being dis: fi dart dem both, if possible, one instantly afta di ada inna di same whale; so dat if, inna di coming drag, one shuda draw out, di ada one may still retain a hold. A one doubling a di chances. But it very often happen dat owing to di instantaneous, violent, convulsive running a di whale upon receiving di first iron, it become impossible fi di harpooneer, however lightning-like inna him movements, fi pitch di secan iron inna him. Nevertheless, as di secan iron already connect wid di line, an di line a run, hence dat deh weapon haffi, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out a di boat, somehow an somewhere; else di most terrible jeopardy woulda involve all hands. Tumbled inna di wata, it accordingly is in such cases; di spare coils a box line (mentioned inna a preceding chapter) mek dis feat, in most instances, prudently practicable. But dis critical act is not always unattended wid di saddest an most fatal casualties.</p>
<p>Furthermore: yuh haffi know seh wen di secan iron get throw ovaboard, it densforth become a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly curvetting bout both boat an whale, entangling di lines, or cutting dem, an mek a prodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in general, it possible fi secure it again until di whale get fairly capture an a corpse.</p>
<p>Consider, now, how it mus be inna di case a four boats all a engage one unusually strong, active, an knowing whale; wen owing to dem qualities inna him, as well as to di thousand concurring accidents a such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling bout him. Fi, a chuu, each boat get supply wid several harpoons fi bend pan di line if di fos wan be ineffectually dart widout recovery. All dem particulars deh faithfully narrated yah, as dem naa go fail fi elucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter weh dem a go paint.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00069">CHAPTER 64. Stubb's Supper.</h2>
<p>Stubb's whale did get kill some distance fram di ship. It was a calm; so, forming a tandem a three boats, wi staat di slow business a towing di trophy to di Pequod. An now, as wi eighteen man wid wi thirty-six arms, an one hundred an eighty thumbs an fingers, slowly toiled hour afta hour pan dat deh inert, sluggish corpse inna di sea; an it did look hardly fi budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we move. Fi, pan di great canal a Hang-Ho, or weh dem call it, inna China, four or five laborers pan di foot-path ago draw a bulky freighted junk at di rate a a mile an hour; but dis grand argosy we tow heavily forged along, as if laden wid pig-lead inna bulk.</p>
<p>Darkness come on; but three lights up an dung inna di Pequod's main-rigging dimly guide wi way; til wi did a draw nearer wi si Ahab a drop one a several more lanterns ova di bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing di heaving whale fi a moment, him issue di usual orders fi secure it fi di night, an den gi him lantern to a seaman, go him way inna di cabin, an neva come forward again until morning.</p>
<p>Though, inna di overseeing di pursuit a dis whale, Captain Ahab did evinced him customary activity, fi call it so; yet now dat di creature did dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, did a work inna him; as if di sight a dat deh dead body remind him seh Moby Dick did still a go get slain; an though a thousand ada whales did bring to him ship, all dat wouldn't one jot advance him grand, monomaniac object. Very soon yuh woulda tink fram di sound pan di Pequod's decks, seh all hands did a prepare fi cast anchor inna di deep; fi heavy chains a get drag along di deck, an a thrust rattling outa di port-holes. But by dem clanking links deh, di vast corpse itself, not di ship, a fi be moored. Tied by di head to di stern, an by di tail to di bows, di whale now lay wid it black hull close to di vessel's an seen thru di darkness a di night, weh obscure di spars an rigging aloft, di two—ship an whale, did look like dem did a joke tugeda like colossal bullocks, weh di ada one did a stan up*.</p>
<p>*A likkle item may as well be related yah. Di strongest an most reliable hold weh di ship have pan di whale wen it moor alongside, is by di flukes or tail; an as fram it greater density dat deh part is relatively heavier dan any other (excepting di side-fins), it flexibility even inna death, cause it fi sink low beath di surface; so dat wid di han yu kyaahn get aafa di buot, fi put di chien roun it. But dis difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a likkle, strong line is prepared wid a wooden float at it outer end, an a weight inna it middle, while di other end is secured to di ship. By adroit management di wooden float mek fi rise pan di ada side a di mass, so dat now having girdled di whale, di chain readily mek fi follow suit; an being slip along di body, is at last locked fast round di smallest part a di tail, at di point a junction wid it broad flukes or lobes.</p>
<p>If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on deck, Stubb, him second mate, flushed wid conquest, betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such a unwonted bustle did deh inna dat di staid Starbuck, him official superior, quietly resign to him fi di time di sole management a affairs. One small, helping cause a all dis liveliness inna Stubb, did soon mek strangely manifest. Stubb was a high liver; him did somewhat intemperately fond a di whale as a flavorish ting to him palate.</p>
<p>“A steak, a steak, ere mi sleep! Yuh, Daggoo! ovaboard yuh go, an cut mi one fram him small!”</p>
<p>Yahso be it known, dat though dem wild fishermen yah no, as a general ting, an according to di great military maxim, mek di enemy defray di current expenses a di war (at least before dem realise di proceeds a di voyage), yet now an den yuh find some a dem Nantucketers yah weh have a genuine relish fi dat deh particular part a di Sperm Whabble designated; comprising di tapering extremity a di body.</p>
<p>Bout midnight dat deh steak did cut an cook; an lighted by two lanterns a sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stan up to him spermaceti supper at di capstan-head, as if dat deh capstan was a sideboard. Nor Stubb was di only banqueter pan whale's flesh dat deh night. Mingling dem mumblings wid him own mastications, thousands on thousands a sharks, swarming round di dead leviathan, smackingly feasted pan it fatness. Di few sleepers dem dung inna dem bunks did often startled by di sharp slap a dem tails against di hull, widin a few inches a di sleepers dem heart. Wen yuh look ova di side yuh coulda jus see dem (as before yuh hear dem) a wallow inna di sullen, black waters, an a turn ova pan dem back as dem a scoop out huge globular pieces a di whale a di bigness a human head. Dis particular feat a di shark look all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, dem contrive fi gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part a di universal problem a all tings. Di mark dem so lef pan di whale, maita bes laik di hollow weh a carpenter mek inna countersinking fi a screw.</p>
<p>Though amid all di smoking horror an diabolism a one sea-fight, sharks ago be seen longingly gazing up to di ship's decks, like hungry dogs round a table weh red meat a get carve, ready fi bolt dung every killed man weh dem toss to dem; an though, while di valiant butchers ova di deck-table a thus cannibally carve each other's live meat wid carving-knives all gilded an tasselled, di sharks, also, wid dem jewel-hilted mout, a quarrelsomely carve weh unda di table at di dead meat; an though, if yuh did a turn di whole affair upside dung, it woulda still be pretty much di same ting, dat is fi seh, a shocking sharkish business enough fi all parties; an though sharks also a di invariable outriders a all slave ships weh a cross di Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, fi be handy in case a parcel is fi be carryed anywhere, or a dead slave fi be decently buried; an though one or two ada like instances might be set dung, touching di set terms, places, an occasions, wen sharks do most socially congregate, an most hilariously feast; yet is no conceivable time or occasion wen yuh wi find dem inna such countless numba, an inna gayer or more jovial spirits, dan roun a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If yuh neva si dat deh sight, den suspend yuh decision bout di propriety a devil-worship, an di expediency a conciliating di devil.</p>
<p>But, as yet, Stubb neva heed di mumblings a di banquet weh did a gwaan so nier him, no more dan di sharks heed di smacking a him own epicurean lips.</p>
<p>“Cook, cook!—weh dat deh old Fleece deh?” him cry at length, widening him legs still furda, as if fi form a more secure base fi him supper; an, at di same time a darting him fork inna di dish, as if him a stab wid him lance; “cook, yuh cook!—sail dis way, cook!”</p>
<p>Di ole black, not inna no very high glee at having been roused before him warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, come shambling along fram him galley, for, like many old blacks, deh did have someting di matter wid him knee-pans, weh him neva keep well scoured like him other pans; dis uol Fleece, as dem did a call him, come shuffling an limping along, assisting him step wid him tongs, weh, afta a clumsy fashion, did mek outa straightened iron hoops; dis uol Ebony floundered along, an in obedience to di word a command, come to a dead stop pan di opposite side a Stubb's sideboard; wen, wid both hands fold before him, an resting pan him two-legged cane, him bow him arched back still further ova, at di same time sideways inclining him head, so as fi bring him bes ear inna play.</p>
<p>“Cook,” seh Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to him mout, “yuh no tink dis steak is rather overdone? Yuh been beat dis steak too much, cook; it too tender. Don't mi always seh dat fi be good, a whale-steak haffi be tough? Deh have dem sharks deh now ova di side, Weh yuh no tink an see a tough? shindy dem a kick up! Cook, go an talk to dem; “nou den, go priich tu dem!”</p>
<p>Sullenly tek di lantern weh dem did a offer, old Fleece limp across di deck to di bulwarks; an den, wid one han a drop him light low ova di sea, so as fi get a good view a him congregation, wid di neda han him solemnly flourish him tongs, an leaning far ova di side inna a mumbling voice staat address di sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind, overheard all weh did a seh.</p>
<p>“Fellow-critters: Mi get order yah fi seh yuh haffi stop dat dam noise dare. Yuh hear? Stop dat dam smackin' ob de lip! Massa Stubb seh dat yuh can fill yuh dam belies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! yuh haffi stop dat dam racket!”</p>
<p>“Cook,” yah Stubb interposed, accompanying di word wid a sudden slap pan di shoulda,—“Cook! why, damn yuh eyes, yuh nuh swear dat way wen yuh a preach. Dat a nuh way fi convert sinners, cook!”</p>
<p>“Who dat? Den preach to him yuhself,” sullenly turning fi go.</p>
<p>“No, cook; gwaan, gwaan.”</p>
<p>“Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—</p>
<p>"Rite!" Stubb baal out, approvingly, “coax 'em to it; try dat,” an Fleece continue.</p>
<p>“Yuh is all sharks, an by natur wery woracious, yet mi a zay to yuh, fellow-critters, dat deh woraciousness—'top dat dam slappin' ob de tail! How yuh tink fi hear, spose yuh keep up such a dam slappin' an bitin' dare?”</p>
<p>“Cook,” Stubb baal out, a collaring him, “Mi naa go have dat deh swearing. Talk to 'em gentlemanly.”</p>
<p>Once more di sermon proceed.</p>
<p>“Yuh woraciousness, fellow-critters, mi nuh blame yuh so much fi; dat a natur, an can't be help; but fi gobern dat wicked natur, dat is de pint. Yuh a sharks, sartin; but if yuh gobern de shark inna yuh, why den yuh be angel; fi all angel nuh go more shark well danned, Nowren'd, try yah. Yuh woulda be cibil, a helping yuhself fram dat whale. Don't be tearin' de blubber out yuh neighbour's mout, Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale? mouts sometimes have de small bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not fi swaller wid, but fi bit off de blubber fi de small fry ob sharks, dat can't get into de scrouge fi help demself.”</p>
<p>“Well done, old Fleece!” Stubb baal out, “dat a Christianity; gwaan.”</p>
<p>“No use goin' on; di dam willains dem ago keep a scougin' an slappin' each oder, Massa Stubb; dem nuh hear one word; no use a-preachin' to such dam g'uttons as yuh call 'em, til dare bellies full, an dare bellies is bottomless; an wen dem get dem full, dem nah go dent inna yuh dear sin; sea, go fast to sleep pan de coral, an can't hear not'ing at all, no more, fi eber an eber.”</p>
<p>“Upon mi soul, mi bout a di same opinion, so gi di benediction, Fleece, an mi ago weh to mi supper.”</p>
<p>Pan dis, Fleece, holding both han dem ova di fishy mob, raise him shrill voice, an cried—</p>
<p>“Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up di damndest row as ever yuh can; fill yuh dam' belies 'til dem bust—an den dead.”</p>
<p>“Now, cook,” seh Stubb, resume him supper at di capstan; “stan up jus weh yuh did stan before, deh, ova against mi, an pay particular attention.”</p>
<p>“All dention,” seh Fleece, again stooping ova pan him tongs inna di desired position.</p>
<p>“Well,” seh Stubb, a help himself freely meanwhile; “Mi ago go back to di subject a dis steak. Inna di first place, how old yuh is, cook?”</p>
<p>“Weh dat do wid de 'teak,” seh di ole black, testily.</p>
<p>“Silence! How old yuh is, cook?”</p>
<p>“'Bout ninety, dem seh,” him gloomily muttered.</p>
<p>“An yuh live inna dis ya worl haad pan one hundred years, cook, an yuh nuh know yet how fi cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting anodda mouthful at di last word, so dat morsel did look like a continuation a di kweschan. “Weh yuh born, cook?”</p>
<p>“'Hind de hatchway, inna ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke.”</p>
<p>“Born inna a ferry-boat! Dat's queer, too. But mi waan know weh country yuh born inna, cook!”</p>
<p>“Mi neva seh de Roanoke country?” him cry sharply.</p>
<p>“No, yu neva, kuk; bot mi wi tel yu wa mi a kom tu, kuk. Yu afi go a yu yaad an baan uova agen; yu no nuo ou fi kuk wail-stiek yet.”</p>
<p>“Bress mi soul, if mi cook noder one,” him growl, angryly, turning round fi depart.</p>
<p>“Come back, cook;—yah, gi mi dem tongs deh;—now tek dat deh bit a steak deh, an tell mi if yuh tink dat deh steak cook as it shuda be? Tek it, mi seh”—holding di tongs towards him—“tek it, an taste it.”</p>
<p>Faintly smacking him withered lips ova it fi a moment, di old negro muttered, “Best cooked 'teak mi eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”</p>
<p>“Cook,” Stubb seh, a square himself once more; “yuh belong to di church?”</p>
<p>“Pass one once inna Cape-Down,” di ole man seh sullenly.</p>
<p>“An yuh don once inna yuh life pass a holy church inna Cape-Town, weh yuh doubtless overhear a holy parson a address him hearers as him beloved fellow-creatures, have yuh, cook! An yet yuh come yah, an tell mi such a dreadful lie as yuh did jus now, eh?” Stubb seh. “Weh yuh expect fi go, cook?”</p>
<p>“Go to bed berry soon,” him mumble, half-turning as him did a talk.</p>
<p>“Avast! heave to! Mi mean wen yuh dead, cook. A one owful kweschan. Now weh yuh ansa?”</p>
<p>“Wen dis old brack man ded,” di negro seh slowly, a change him whole air an demeanor, “im himself naa go noweh; but some bressed angel ago come an fetch him.”</p>
<p>"Fet him? How? Inna a coach an four, as dem fetch Elijah? An fetch him weh?"</p>
<p>“Up dere,” Fleece seh, a hold him tongs straight ova him head, an a keep it deh very solemnly.</p>
<p>“So, den, yuh expect fi go up inna wi main-top, yuh, cook, wen yuh dead? But yuh nuh know di higher yuh climb, di colder it get? Main-top, eh?”</p>
<p>“Didn't seh dat t'all,” seh Fleece, again inna di sulks.</p>
<p>“Yu se op de, no chruu? an nou luk yuself, an si we yu tong dem a point. Bot, maita yu ekspek fi get iina evn bai kraal chuu di lubber huol, kuk; bot, no, no, kuk, yu no get de, eksep yu go di rigyaad wie, roun bai di rig. A wan tiklish bizniz, bot yu no afi du els, bot els it no go. wi deh inna heaven yet. Yuh hear yuh hat inna one hand, an clap t'op a yuh heart, cook Weh!</p>
<p>“All 'dention,” seh di old black, wid both han dem place as desired, vainly wriggling him grizzled head, as if fi get both ears in front at one an di same time.</p>
<p>“Well den, cook, yuh see dis whale-steak a yuh did so very bad, dat mi put it out a sight as soon as possible; yuh see dat, don't yuh? Well, fi di future, wen yuh cook anodda whale-steak fi mi private table yah, di capstan, mi ago tell yuh weh fi do so as yuh nuh spoil it by overdoing di Hold steak, an show inna one han. to it wid di ada, dish it; d'ye hear? An now to-morrow, cook, mek sure yuh stan by fi get di tip a him fins, mek dem put dem inna pickle. As fi di ends a di flukes, mek dem soused, cook.</p>
<p>But Fleece did hardly get three paces off, wen dem did a recall him.</p>
<p>“Cook, gi mi cutlets fi supper to-morrow night inna di mid-watch. D'ye hear? away yuh sail, den.—Halloa! stop! mek a bow before yuh go.—Avast heaving again! Whale-balls fi breakfast—don't forget.”</p>
<p>“Wish, by gor! whale eat him, 'stead of him eat whale. Mi bressed if him ain't more of shark dan Massa Shark himself,” muttered di old man, limping away; wid weh sage ejaculation him goh to him hammock.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00070">CHAPTER 65. Di Whale as a Dish.</h2>
<p>Dat deh mortal man shuda feed pan di creature weh feed him lamp, an, like Stubb, eat him by him own light, as yuh may seh; dis look so outlandish a ting dat yuh haffi go a likkle inna di history an philosophy a it.</p>
<p>It is upon record, dat three centuries ago di tongue a di Right Whale did estimated a great delicacy inna France, an command large prices deh. Also, dat inna Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook a di court get a handsome reward fi invent a admirable sauce fi be eat wid barbacued porpoises, weh, yuh memba, a one species a whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to dis day considered fine eating. Di meat mek inna balls bout di size a billiard balls, an being well seasoned an spiced might be tek fi turtle-balls or veal balls. Di old monks dem a Dunfermline did very fond a dem. Dem did have a great porpoise grant fram di crown.</p>
<p>Di fact is, dat mongst him hunters at least, di whale woulda by all hands be considered a noble dish, if deh neva have so much a him; but wen yuh come fi sit dung before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it tek weh yuh appetite. Only di most unprejudiced a man dem like Stubb, nowadays partake a cooked whales; but di Esquimaux dem nuh so fastidious. Wi all know how dem live pan whales, an dem have rare old vintages a prime old train oil. Zogranda, one a dem most famous doctors, recommend strips a blubber fi infants, as being exceedingly juicy an nourishing. An dis remind mi seh certain Englishmen, weh long ago did accidentally lef inna Greenland by a whaling vessel—dat dem man deh did actually live fi several months pan di moldy scraps a whales weh did lef ashore afta dem did try out di blubber. Among di Dutch whalemen dem scrap yah dem call “fritters”; weh, indeed, dem greatly resemble, being brown an crisp, an smell someting like old Amsterdam housewives' dough-nuts or oly-cooks, wen fresh. Dem have such an eatable look dat di most self-denying stranger can hardly keep him hands off.</p>
<p>But weh further depreciate di whale as a civilized dish, is him exceeding richness. Im a di great prize ox a di sea, too fat fi be delicately good. Look pan him hump, weh woulda be as fine eating as di buffalo's (we is esteemed a rare dish), if it neva such a solid pyramid a fat. But di spermaceti itself, how bland an creamy dat is; like di transparent, half-jellied, white meat a one cocoanut inna di third month a it growth, yet far too rich fi supply a substitute fi butter. Nevertheless, plenty whalemen have a method fi absorb it inna some ada substance, an den partake a it. Inna di long try watches a di night it is a common ting fi di seamen dem dip dem ship-biscuit inna di huge oil-pots an mek dem fry deh awhile. Plenty a good supper mi mek so.</p>
<p>Inna di case a one likkle Sperm Whale di brains dem accounted a fine dish. Di casket a di skull brok iin wid wan axe, an di two plump, whitish lobes dem tek out (precisely resembling two big puddings), dem den mix dem wid flour, an cook dem inna a most delectable mess, inna flavor somwe resembling calves' head, weh a quite a dish mongst some epicures; an everybody know seh some young bucks mongst di epicures, by continually dining upon calves's brains, by an by get fi have a likkle brains a dem own, so as to be able fi tell a calf's head fram dem own heads; weh, indeed, require uncommon discrimination. An dat a di reason why a young buck wid a intelligent looking calf's head before him, is somehow one a di saddest sights yuh can see. Di head look a sort a reproachfully at him, wid an “Et tu Brute!” ekspreshan.</p>
<p>A no, perhaps, entirely because di whale so excessively unctuous dat landsmen seem fi regard di eating a him wid abhorrence; dat appear fi result, inna some way, fram di consideration before mentioned: <i>ie</i> dat a man shuda eat a newly murdered ting a di sea, an eat it too by it own light. But no doubt di fos man weh eva murder a ox did get consider as a murderer; maybe dem did hang him; an if him did get put pan him trial wid ox, him woulda certainly be; an him certainly deserve it if any murderer do it. Go a di meat-market a one Saturday night an si di crowd a live bipeds a stare up at di long rows a dead quadrupeds. Dat deh sight nuh tek a tooth outa di cannibal's jaw? Cannibals? who a nuh cannibal? Mi tell yuh it ago be more tolerable fi di Fejee weh salt dung a lean missionary inna him cellar against a coming famine; it ago be more tolerable fi dat deh provident Fejee, mi seh, inna di day a judgment, dan fi yuh, civilized an enlightened gourmand, weh nailest geese to di ground an feastest pan dem bloated livers inna thy paté-de-foie-gras.</p>
<p>But Stubb, him eat di whale by it own light, noh true? an dat a add insult to injury, is it? Look pan yuh knife-handle, deh, mi civilized an enlightened gourmand dining off dat deh roast beef, weh dat deh handle mek outa?—weh but di bones a di bredda a di very ox yuh a eat? An weh yuh pick yuh teet wid, afta yuh devour dat deh fat goose? Wid a feda a di same fowl. An wid weh quill di Secretary a di Society fi di Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders did formally indite him circulars? A ongl widin di laas mont or two dat deh society pass a resolution fi patronize notn but steel pens.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00071">CHAPTER 66. Di Shark Massacre.</h2>
<p>Wen inna di Southern Fishery, a Sperm Whale weh dem capture, afta long an weary toil, get bring langside late at night, it no, as a general ting at least, customary fi proceed at once to di business a cut him in. For dat deh business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed; an require all hands fi set bout it. So, di common usage is fi tek in all sail; lash di helm a'lee; an den sen every one below to dem hammock til daylight, wid di reservation dat, until dat time, anchor-watches shall be kept; dat mean, two an two fi an hour, each couple, di crew inna rotation shall mount di deck fi see dat all go well.</p>
<p>But sometimes, especially pan di Line inna di Pacific, dis plan naa go ansa at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round di moored carcase, dat were him lef so fi six hours, say, pan a stretch, likkle more dan di skeleton woulda be visible by morning. Inna most ada parts a di ocean, however, weh dem fish yah no so largely abound, dem wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring dem up wid sharp whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, weh, inna some instances, only seems to tickle dem into still greater activity. But it neva so inna di present case wid di Pequod's sharks; though, fi be sure, any man weh neva accustome to such sights, fi did look ova har side dat deh night, woulda almost tink seh di whole round sea was one huge cheese, an dem shark deh di maggots inna it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting di anchor-watch afta him supper did conclude; an wen, accordingly, Queequeg an a forecastle seaman come pan deck, no likkle excitement did create among di sharks; fi immediately suspend di cutting stages ova di side, an lowering three lanterns, so dat dem cast long gleams a light ova di turbid sea, dem two mariners yah, darting dem long whaling-spades, keep up an incessant murdering a di sharks,* by striking di keen steel deep inna dem skulls, see dem only vital part. But inna di foamy confusion a dem mixed an struggling hosts, di marksmen dem couldn't always hit dem mark; an dis bring bout new revelations a di incredible ferocity a di foe. Dem viciously snap, not only at each other's disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit dem own; til dem entrails deh did look like dem did a swallow ova an ova again by di same mout, fi be oppositely voided by di gaping wound. Nor dis was all. It neva safe fi meddle wid di corpses an ghosts a dem creature yah. A sort a generic or Pantheistic vitality did look like it did a lurk inna dem very joints an bones, afta weh dem mighta call di individual life did depart. Kill an hoisted pan deck fi di sake a him skin, one a dem shark deh almost tek poor Queequeg's han off, wen him did a try shut dung di dead lid a him murderous jaw.</p>
<p>*Di whaling-spade weh dem use fi cut-in mek outa di very bes steel; is bout di bigness a one man's spread han; an in general shape, correspond to di garden implement afta which it name; only its sides dem perfectly flat, an its upper end considerably narrower dan di lower. Dis weapon is always keep as sharp as possible; an wen yuh use it it occasionally honed, jus like a razor. Inna it socket, a stiff pole, fram twenty to thirty feet long, is insert fi a handle.</p>
<p>“Queequeg no care weh god mek him shark,” di savage seh, agonizingly lifting him han up an dung; “wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de god wat mek shark mus be one dam Ingin.”</p>
