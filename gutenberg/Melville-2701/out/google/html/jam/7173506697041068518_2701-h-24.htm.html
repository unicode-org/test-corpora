<h2 id="pgepubid00138">CHAPTER 131. Di Pequod Meets Di Delight.</h2>
<p>Di intense Pequod sail on; di rolling waves an days did a go by; di life-buoy-coffin still lightly swing; an wan neda ship, weh did misname di Delight, did get diskraib. As she did a draw nigh, all eyes did a fix pan har broad beams, weh dem call shears, weh, inna some whaling-ships, cross di quarter-deck at di height a eight or nine feet; serving fi carry di spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.</p>
<p>Pan di stranger's shears dem did si di shattered, white ribs, an some few splintered planks, a weh did once a one whale-boat; but yuh now si chruu dis wreck, as plainly as yuh see chruu di peeled, half-unhinged, an bleaching skeleton a one horse.</p>
<p>“Yuh si di White Whale?”</p>
<p>"Luk!" di hollow-cheeked captain ansa fram him taffrail; an wid him trumpet him point to di wreck.</p>
<p>“Yuh kill him?”</p>
<p>“Di harpoon neva forge yet weh eva ago do dat,” di ada one ansa, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock pan di deck, whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors did busy a sewing tugeda.</p>
<p>“Not forged!” an snatching Perth's leveled iron fram di crotch, Ahab hold it out, exclaiming—“Look yuh, Nantucketer; yah inna dis han mi hold him death! Tempered in blood, an tempered by lightning are dem barbs; an mi swear fi temper dem triply inna dat deh hot place behind di fin, weh di White Whaurs feel him life!”</p>
<p>“Den God keep yuh, old man—see's thou dat”—pointing to di hammock—“Mi bury only one a five stout man, who did alive only yesterday, but dem did dead ere night. Only <i>dat</i> one mi bury; di rest dem did beri before dem dead; yuh sail pan dem tomb.” Den turning to him crew—“Yuh ready deh? put di plank den pan di rail, an lift di body; so, den—Oh! God”—advancing towards di hammock wid uplifted hands—“mek di resurrection an di life——”</p>
<p>“Brace forward! Up helm!” Ahab baal out laik laitnin tu im man dem.</p>
<p>But di suddenly staat Pequod neva quick enough fi escape di sound a di splash weh di corpse soon mek as it struck di sea; not so quick, indeed, but dat some a di flying bubbles dem mighta sprinkle har hull wid dem ghostly baptism.</p>
<p>As Ahab now glide fram di dejected Delight, di strange life-buoy weh did a hang a di Pequod's stern did come inna conspicuous relief.</p>
<p>“Ha! yonder! look yonder, man!” cried a foreboding voice inna har wake. “In vain, oh, yuh strangers, yuh fly wi sad burial; yuh but turn wi yuh taffrail fi show wi yuh coffin!”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00139">CHAPTER 132. Di Symphony.</h2>
<p>A did a clear steel-blue day. Di firmaments a air an sea did hardly separable inna dat deh all-pervading azure; only, di pensive air did transparently pure an soft, wid a woman look, an di robust an man-like sea did a heave wid long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson chest inna him sleep.</p>
<p>Hither, an thither, pan high, did a glide di snow-white wings a small, unspeckled birds; dem was di gentle thoughts a di feminine air; but to an fro inna di deeps, far dung inna di bottomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish, an sharks; an dem deh was di strong, troubled, murderous thoughts a di masculine sea.</p>
<p>But though thus contrasting widin, di contrast was only inna shades an shadows outside; dem two deh did look one; it was only di sex, as it were, weh distinguish dem.</p>
<p>Aloft, like a royal czar an king, di sun did a gi dis gentle air to dis bold an rolling sea; even as bride to groom. An at di girdling line a di horizon, a soft an tremulous motion—most seen yah at di equator—denoted di fond, throbbing trust, di loving alarms, wid which di poor bride did gi har bosom weh.</p>
<p>Tied up an twisted; gnarled an knotted wid wrinkles; haggardly firm an unyielding; him eyes dem a glow like coal, weh still a glow inna di ashes a ruin; untottering Ahab did stan out inna di clearness a di morn; lifting him splintered helmet a brow to di fair girl's forehead a heaven.</p>
<p>Oh, immortal infancy, an innocent a di azure! Invisible winged creatures weh frolic all roun wi! Sweet childhood a air an sky! how yuh did oblivious a old Ahab's close-coiled woe! But so mi si likkle Miriam an Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol roun dem old sire; sporting wid di circle a singed locks weh did a grow pan di marge a dat deh burnt-out crater a him brain.</p>
<p>Slowly crossing di deck fram di scuttle, Ahab lean ova di side an watch how him shadow inna di wata sink an sank to him gaze, di more an di more dat him strive fi pierce di profundity. But di lovely aromas inna dat deh enchanted air did at last seem fi dispel, fi a moment, di cankerous ting inna him soul. Dat deh glad, happy air, dat deh winsome sky, did at last stroke an caress him; di step-mother world, so long cruel—forbidding—now throw affectionate arms roun him stubborn neck, an did seem fi joyously sob ova him, as if ova one, dat however wilful an erring, she coulda yet find it inna har heart fi save an fi bless. Fram unda him slouched hat Ahab drop a tear inna di sea; nor did all di Pacific contain such wealth as dat one wee drop.</p>
<p>Starbuck si di uol man; si him, how him heavily lean ova di side; an him did a hear inna him own true heart di measureless sobbing weh did a steal outa di center a di serenity roun. Im tek kier no fi toch im, ar mek im si im, im stil kom nier im an tan op de.</p>
<p>Ahab ton roun.</p>
<p>“Starbuck!”</p>
<p>"Sar."</p>
<p>“Oh, Starbuck! it a one mild, mild wind, an a mild looking sky. Pan such a day—very much such a sweetness as dis—mi strike mi first whale—a bwoy-harpooneer a eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago! Forty years a continual whaling! forty years a privation, an per-time, fi di staam! pitiless sea! fi forty years Ahab lef di peaceful lan, fi forty years fi mek war pan di horrors a di deep! sympathy fram di green country widout—oh, weariness! him daily han, an break di worl's fresh bread to mi moldy crusts—away, whole oceans away, fram dat deh young girl-wife weh mi wedded past fifty, an sail fi Cape Horn di next day, leaving only one dent inna mi marriage pillow—wife?—rather a widow wid har husband alive wen mi married A widowife, or dat deh wife? har, Starbuck; an den, di madness, di frenzy, di boiling blod an di smoking brow, wid which, fi a thousand lowerings old Ahab did furiously, foamingly chase him prey—more a demon dan a man!—aye, aye weh a forty years' fool—fool—old fool, was been chase of dis, why we! di arm a di oar, an di iron, an di lance? very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? Mi feel deadly faint, bowed, an humped, as if mi was Adam, staggering beath the piled centuries since God!—stave my brain!—mockery bitter, biting mockery of mi did a feel weary! integral uol? Klos! tan op chrang tu mi, Staarbak; mek mi luk iina wahn man yai; it beta dan fi luk ina sii ar skai; beta dan fi luk pan Gad. Bai di griin lan; bai di brait aat-stuon! dis a di majik glaas, man; Mi si mi waif an mi pikni iina yu yai. No, no; stie pan di ship, pan di ship, pan di ship!—lowa no wen mi du; wen branded Ahab gi chase to Moby Dick. Dat hazard nuh fi be yuh. No, no wid di far away home weh mi see inna dat deh eye!”</p>
<p>“Oh, mi Captain! mi Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, afta all! why any one fi gi chase to dat hated fish! Away wid mi! mek wi fly dem deadly waters! mek wi home! Wife an pickney, too, a Starbuck's—wife an child a him brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth even as thine, sarly, an loving childe, wife, an pickney; longing, paternal old age! Away! mek mi alter di course! How cheerly, how hilariously, O my Captain, woulda we bowl pan wi way fi see old Nantucket again!</p>
<p>“Dem have, dem have. Mi have see dem—some summer days inna di morning. Bout dis time—yes, it is him noon nap now—di bwoy vivaciously wake; sit up inna bed; an him mada tell him bout mi, bout cannibal old mi; how mi deh abroad pan di deep, but will still come back fi dance him again.”</p>
<p>“'A mi Mieri, mi Mieri arself! Shi pramis se mi bwai, evri maanin, shuda get kyari go a di il fi kech di fos glimps a im faada siel! Yes, yes! no muor! it don! wi hed fi Nantucket! Kom, mi Kaptan, stodi out di kuos, an mek wi go! Si, si! di bwai fies fram di il!'</p>
<p>But Ahab's glance did averti; like a blighted fruit tree him shake, an cast him last, cindered apple to di soil.</p>
<p>“Weh it is, weh nameless, inscrutable, unearthly ting is it; weh cozening, hidden lord an master, an cruel, remorseless emperor command mi; dat against all natural lovings an longings, mi so keep pushing, an crowd, an jamming miself on all di time; recklessly mek mi ready fi do weh inna mi natural owner, so much as mi neva durt A Ahab, Ahab? Is mi, God, or who, weh lift dis arm? but is like a errand-boy inna heaven; By heaven, man, we are turned round and round inna dis world, like yonder windlass, an Fate is di handspike. An all di time, lo! is drag to di bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, an a mild looking sky; an di air smell now, as if it blow fram a far-away meadow; dem did a mek hay somwe unda di slopes a di Andes, Starbuck, an di mowers dem a sleep mongx di new-mown hay. field. Sleep? Aye, an rust mid greenness;</p>
<p>But blanched to a corpse's hue wid despair, di Mate did steal weh.</p>
<p>Ahab cross di deck fi gaze ova pan di ada side; but staat at two reflected, fixed eyes inna di wata deh. Fedallah did a motionlessly lean ova di same rail.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00140">CHAPTER 133. Di Chase—First Day.</h2>
<p>Dat deh night, inna di mid-watch, wen di old man—as him wont at intervals—step out fram di scuttle weh him did a lean inna, an goh to him pivot-hole, him suddenly thrust out him face fiercely, snuffing up di sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, inna drawing nigh to some barbar isle. Him declare seh a whale haffi deh near. Soon dat deh peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by di living sperm whale, was palpable to all di watch; nor was no mariner surprised wen, afta dem did inspect di compass, an den di dog-vane, an den dem did ascertain di precise bearing a di odor as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly order di ship's course fi be slightly altered, an di sail fi be shortened.</p>
<p>Di acute policy weh did a dictate dem movements yah did sufficiently vindicated at daybreak, by di sight a one long sleek pan di sea directly an lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, an resembling inna di pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, di polished metallic-like marks a some swift tide-rip, at di mout a diep, rapid stream.</p>
<p>“Man di mast-hed dem! Kaal aal han!”</p>
<p>Thundering wid di butts a three clubbed handspikes pan di forecastle deck, Daggoo roused di sleepers wid such judgment claps dat dem did a look like dem did a exhale fram di scuttle, so instantaneously did dem appear wid dem clothes inna dem hands.</p>
<p>“Weh yuh si?” Ahab baal out, a flat im fies tu di skai.</p>
<p>“Notn, notn sa!” was di sound hailing dung in reply.</p>
<p>“T'gallant sails!—stunsails! alow an aloft, an pan both sides!”</p>
<p>All sail being set, him now cast loose di life-line, reserved fi swaying him to di main royal-mast head; an inna a few moments dem did a hoist him deh, wen, while but two thirds a di way aloft, an while peering ahead thru di horizontal vacancy between di main-top-sail an top-gallant-sail, him raise a gull-like cry inna di air. “Deh she blow!—deh she blow! A hump like a snow-hill! A Moby Dick!”</p>
<p>Fired by di cry weh did look like di three look-outs dem did a tek up simultaneously, di man dem pan deck rush to di rigging fi behold di famous whale weh dem did a pursue so long. Ahab did now get him final perch, some feet above di ada look-outs, Tashtego did a stan up jus unda him pan di cap a di top-gallant-mast, so dat di Indian head did almost pan a level wid Ahab heel. Fram dis height di whale did now si some mile or so ahead, at every roll a di sea revealing him high sparkling hump, an regularly jetting him silent spout inna di air. To di credulous mariners it did look like di same silent spout dem did so long ago beheld inna di moonlit Atlantic an Indian Oceans.</p>
<p>“An non a unu neva si it before?” Ahab baal out, a greet di man dem weh did a sidong roun im.</p>
<p>“Mi si him almost di same instant, sir, weh Captain Ahab did, an mi cry out,” seh Tashtego.</p>
<p>“Not di same instant; not di same—no, di doubloon a fi mi, Fate reserve di doubloon fi mi. <i>Mi</i> only; none a unu couldn't raise di White Whale fos. Deh shi blow!—deh shi blow!—deh shi blow! Deh agen!—deh agen!” him did a cry, inna long-drawn, lingering, methodic tones, attuned to di gradual prolongings a di whale's visible jets. “Im a go sound! Inna stunsails! Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, memba, stay pan board, an keep di ship. Helm deh! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man, steady! Deh go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready di boats dem deh? Stan by, Lower, Mr. Starbuck. Starbuck; lower, lower,—quick, quicker!” an him slid thru di air to di deck.</p>
<p>“Im a go straight to leeward, sa,” Stubb baal out, “rait ya so fram wi; im kyaahn si di ship yet.”</p>
<p>“Be dumb, man! Stand by di braces! Hard dung di helm!—brace up! Shiver har!—shiver har!—So; well dat! Boats, boats!”</p>
<p>Soon all di boats dem but Starbuck's did drop; all di boat-sails dem set—all di paddles dem a ply; wid rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; an Ahab did a head di onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed him mout.</p>
<p>Like noiseless nautilus shells, dem light prows sped thru di sea; but only slowly dem near di foe. As dem did a near him, di ocean did a grow still more smooth; did look like it did a draw a carpet ova it waves; did look like a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length di breathless hunter come so nigh him seemingly unsuspecting prey, dat him entire dazzling hump did distinctly visible, sliding along di sea as if an isolated ting, an continually set inna a revolving ring a finest, fleecy, greenish foam. Im si di vast, involved wrinkles a di slightly projecting head beyond. Bifuo it, far out pan di soft Turkish-rugged waata dem, di glistening white shadow did a go fram him broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying di shado; an behind, di blue waters interchangeably flow ova inna di moving valley a him steady wake; an pan either han bright bubbles arise an dance by him side. But dem did break again by di light toes a hundreds a gay fowl softly feathering di sea, alternate wid dem fitful flight; an like to some flag-staff rising fram di painted hull a one argosy, di tall but shattered pole a one recent lance weh did a project fram di white whale's back; an at intervals one a di cloud a soft-toed fowls hovering, an to an fro skimming like a canopy ova di fish, silently perched an rocked pan dis pole, di long tail feathers streaming like pennons.</p>
<p>A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness a repose inna swiftness, invested di gliding whale. Not di white bull Jupiter swim weh wid ravished Europa clinging to him graceful horns; him lovely, leering eyes sideways intent pan di maid; wid smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling straight fi di nuptial bower inna Crete; not Jove, not dat great majesty Supreme! did surpass di glorified White Whale as him so divinely swim.</p>
<p>Pan each soft side—coincident wid di parted swell, dat but once lef him, den flow so wide away—pan each bright side, di whale shed off enticings. No wanda deh did have some a di hunters dem weh did a transport an allure by all dis serenity, did a venture fi assail it; but did fatally find dat quietude but di vesture a tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! yuh glide on, to all who fi di first time eye yuh, no matter how many inna dat deh same way yuh may't bejuggled an destroy before.</p>
<p>An so, chruu di serene tranquillities a di tropical sea, mongx waves weh dem han-clappings did suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick move on, still withholding fram sight di full terrors a him submerged trunk, entirely hiding di wrenched hideousness a him jaw. But soon di fore part a him slowly rise fram di wata; fi a instant him whole marbleized body form a high arch, like Virginia's Natural Bridge, an warningly waving him bannered flukes inna di air, di grand god reveal himself, sound, an go out a sight. Hoveringly halting, an dipping pan di wing, di white sea-fowls longingly lingered ova di agitated pool weh him lef.</p>
<p>Wid oars apeak, an paddles dung, di sheets a dem sails adrift, di three boats dem now stilly float, a waiting Moby Dick's reappearance.</p>
<p>“Wan owa,” se Ahab, a stan op root inna im boat stan; an him look beyond di whale's place, towards di dim blue spaces an wide wooing vacancies to leeward. A did only a instant; fi again him eyes dem did a whirl roun inna him head as him did a sweep di watery circle. Di briiz now freshen; di sii staat swel op.</p>
<p>“Di birds dem!—di birds dem!” Tashtego did a baal out.</p>
<p>Inna long Indian file, as wen herons tek wing, di white birds dem did a fly now all towards Ahab's boat; an wen widin a few yards staat flutter ova di wata deh, wheeling round an round, wid joyous, expectant cries. Dem vision did keener dan man's; Ahab couldn't find no sign inna di sea. But suddenly as him peer dung an dung inna it depths, him profoundly si a white living spot weh no bigger dan a white weasel, wid wonderful celerity uprising, an magnifying as it rise, til it turn, an den deh did plainly reveal two long crooked rows a white, glistening teet, floating up fram di unscover bottom. A did Moby Dick's open mout an scroll jaw; him vast, shadowed bulk still half blending wid di blue a di sea. Di glittering mout did a yawn unda di boat like an open-doored marble tomb; an gi one sidelong sweep wid him steering oar, Ahab whirl di craft aside fram dis tremendous apparition. Den, calling pan Fedallah fi change places wid him, go forward to di bows, an seize Perth's harpoon, command him crew fi grab dem oars an stan by to stern.</p>
<p>Now, by reason a dis timely spinning round di boat upon it axis, it bow, by anticipation, did mek fi face di whale's head while yet unda water. But as if perceiving dis stratagem, Moby Dick, wid dat malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting him pleated head lengthwise under the boat.</p>
<p>Thru an chruu; chruu every plank an each rib, it thrilled fi an instant, di whale obliquely lidong pan him back, inna di manner a one biting shark, slowly an feelingly tek it bows full inna him mout, so dat di long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up inna di open air, an one a di teeth dem ketch inna a row-lock. Di bluish pearl-white a di inside a di jaw did deh widin six inches a Ahab head, an did reach higher dan dat. Inna dis attitude di White Whale now shook di slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat har mouse. Wid unanished eyes Fedallah gazed, an cross him arms; but di tiger-yellow crew did a tumbling ova each other's head fi gain di uttermost stern.</p>
<p>An now, while both elastic gunwales did a spring in an out, as di whale did a dallied wid di doomed craft inna dis devilish way; an fram him body weh did a submerge unda di boat, him couldn't be darted at fram di bows, cause di bows dem did almost inna him, as it were; an while di ada boats dem involuntarily pause, as before a quick crisis impossible fi withstand, den it was dat monomaniac Ahab, furious wid dis tantalizing vicinity a him foe, weh put him all alive an helpless inna di very jaws him did hate; frenzied wid all dis, him grab di long bone wid him naked hands, an wildly strove fi wrench it fram it gripe. As now him thus vainly strive, di jaw slip fram him; di frail gunwales dem bent in, collapse, an snap, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit di craft completely inna twiin, an lock demself fast again inna di sea, midway between di two floating wrecks. Dem float aside, di broken ends drooping, di crew at di stern-wreck clinging to di gunwales, an striving fi hold fast to di oars fi lash dem across.</p>
<p>At dat deh preluding moment, ere di boat did yet snap, Ahab, di first fi perceive di whale's intent, by di crafty upraising a him head, a movement weh loose him hold fi di time; at dat deh moment him han did mek one final effort fi push di boat outa di bite. But only slipping further inna di whale's mout, an tilting ova sideways as it slipp, di boat did shake off him hold pan di jaw; spill him outa it, as him lean to di push; an so him fall flat-faced pan di sea.</p>
<p>Ripplingly withdrawing fram him prey, Moby Dick now lay at a likkle distance, vertically thrusting him oblong white head up an dung inna di billows; an at di same time slowly revolving him whole spindled body; so dat wen him vast wrinkled forehead rise—some twenty or more feet outa di wata—di now rising swells, wid all dem confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing dem shivered spray still higher inna di air.* So, inna a gale, di but half baffled Channel billows only recoil fram di base a di Eddystone, triumphantly fi overleap its summit wid dem scud.</p>
<p>*Dis motion is peculiar to di sperm whale. It get it designation (pitchpoling) fram it being likened to dat deh preliminary up-an-down poise a di whale-lance, inna di exercise weh dem call pitchpoling, weh did describe before. By dis motion di whale haffi best an most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.</p>
<p>But soon resume him horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swim swiftly round an round di wrecked crew; sideways churning di water inna him vengeful wake, as if a lashing himself up to still another an more deadly assault. Di sight a di splintered boat did look like it did madden him, as di blood a grapes an mulberries did a cast before Antiochus's elephants inna di book a Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered inna di foam a di whale's insolent tail, an too much a cripple fi swim,—though him coulda still keep float, even inna di heart a such a whirlpool as dat; helpless Ahab's head did si, like a tossed bubble weh di least chance shock might burst. Fram di boat's fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously an mildly eyed him; di clinging crew, at di ada drifting end, couldn't succor him; more dan enough was it fi dem look to demself. Fi so revolvingly appalling was di White Whale's aspect, an so planetarily swift di ever-contracting circles weh him mek, dat him did look horizontally swooping upon dem. An though di ada boats dem, weh neva get no harm, dem did still a hover hard by; still dem neva dare pull inna di eddy fi strike, lest dat woulda be di signal fi di instant destruction a di jeoparized castaways, Ahab an all; nor inna dat deh case dem coulda demself hope fi escape. Wid straining eyes, den, dem stay pan di outer edge a di direful zone, weh center did now become di ole man's head.</p>
<p>Meantime, fram di beginning all dis did a get describe fram di ship's mast heads; an squaring har yards, she did borne dung pan di scene; an was now so nigh, dat Ahab inna di water hail har!—“Sail on the”—but dat deh moment a breaking sea dash pan him fram Moby Dick, an whelmed him fi di time. But struggling out of it again, an chancing fi rise pan a towering crest, him shout,—“Sail pan di whale!—Drive him off!”</p>
<p>Di Pequod's prows dem did point; an breaking up di charmed circle, she effectually part di white whale fram him victim. As him sullenly swim off, di boats dem fly to di rescue.</p>
<p>Dragged inna Stubb's boat wid blood-shot, blinded eyes, di white brine caking inna him wrinkles; di lang tension a Ahab's body strength did crack, an helplessly him yield to him body's doom: fi a time, lying all crushed inna di bottom a Stubb's boat, like one trodden unda foot a herds a elephants. Far inland, nameless wails come fram him, as desolate sounds fram out ravines.</p>
<p>But dis intensity a him physical prostration did but so much di more abbreviate it. Inna wan instant's compass, great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang, di sum total a dem shallow pains deh weh kindly diffuse chruu feebler man's whole life. An so, such hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if di gods dem decree it, inna dem life-time aggregate a whole age a woe, wholly made up a instantaneous intensities; fi even inna dem pointless centres, dem noble natures deh contain di entire circumferences a inferior souls.</p>
<p>“Di harpoon,” seh Ahab, half way rising, an draggingly lean pan one bend arm—“is it safe?”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir, fi it neva dart; dis a it,” Stubb seh, a shuo it.</p>
<p>“Lay it before mi;—any missing man?”</p>
<p>“Wan, two, three, four, five;—dem did have five oars, sir, an yahso a five man.”</p>
<p>“Dat gud.—Elp mi, man; mi wish fi stan op. So, so, mi si im! de! de! a go tu lieward stil; wat a leaping spout!—Hands aaf fram mi! Di etarnal sap ron op ina Ahab bon dem agen! Set di sail; out oars; di elm!”</p>
<p>It is often di case dat wen a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up by another boat, help to work dat deh second boat; an di chase is thus continued wid weh dem call double-banked oars. A so it did deh now. But di added power a di boat neva equal di added power a di whale, cause him did look like him did treble-bank him every fin; swimming wid a velocity weh plainly show, seh if now, unda dem circumstances yah, push on, di chase woulda prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor coulda any crew endure fi so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at di oar; a ting weh barely tolerable only inna some one brief vicissitude. Di ship itself, den, as it sometimes happen, did a offer di most promising intermediate means fi overtake di chase. Accordingly, di boats dem now mek fi har, an dem did soon sway up to dem cranes—di two parts a di wrecked boat did a get secure before—an den hoist everyting to har side, an stack har canvas high up, an sideways outstretch it wid stun-sails, like di double-jointed wings a anbat alross; di Pequod bore dung inna di leeward wake a Moby-Dick. At di well known, methodic intervals, di whale's glittering spout did regularly announce fram di manned mast-heads; an wen him woulda be reported as jus gone dung, Ahab woulda tek di time, an den pacing di deck, binnacle-watch inna han, so soon as di last second a di allotted hour expire, him voice did hear.—“Whose is di doubloon now? D'ye see him?” an if di reply was, No, sir! straightway him command dem fi lift him to him perch. Inna dis way di day did a gwaan; Ahab, now aloft an motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing di planks.</p>
<p>As him did a walk so, an neva seh no sound, except fi hail di man dem op, or fi bid dem hoist a sail still higher, or fi spread one to a still greater breadth—so to an fro pacing, unda him slouched hat, at every turn him pass him own wrecked boat, weh did drop pan di quarter-rede, an lie bak; broken bow to shattered stern. At last him pause before it; an as inna wan already ova-clouded sky fresh troops a clouds will sometimes sail across, so ova di ole man face deh now stole some such added gloom as dis.</p>
<p>Stubb si him pause; an perhaps intendin, not vainly, though, fi evince him own unabated fortitude, an so keep up a valiant place inna him Captain's mind, him advanced, an eyeing di wreck exclaimed—“Di thistle di ass refuse; it prick him mout too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”</p>
<p>“Weh soulless ting is dis weh laugh before a wreck? Man, man! did mi neva know yuh brave as fearless fire (an as mechanical) Mi coulda swear yuh was a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” seh Starbuck a draw near, “'tis a solemn sight; an omen, an an ill one.”</p>
<p>“Omen? omen?—di dictionary! If di gods dem tink fi speak outright to man, dem wi honorably speak outright; not shake dem head, an gi an old wives' darkling hint.—Begone! Unu two a di opposite poles a one ting; Starbuck a Stubb reversed, an Stubb a Starbuck; an unu a two man an Akinh all stan op among di million als; a di peopled earth, nor gods nor man him neighbors!

<p>Di day did nearly done; only di hem a him golden robe did a rustle. Soon, it did almost dark, but di look-out man dem still did a stay unset.</p>
<p>“Chan't see di spout now, sir;—too dark”—creed a voice fram di air.</p>
<p>“How heading wen last seen?”</p>
<p>“As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”</p>
<p>“Gud! him ago travel slower now 'tis night. Down royals an top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. Wi no fi run ova him before morning; him a mek a passage now, an may heave-to a while.

<h2 id="pgepubid00141">CHAPTER 134. Di Chase—Second Day.</h2>
<p>At day-break, di three mast-heads dem did punctually manned afresh.</p>
<p>“Yu si im?” Ahab baal out afta im gi likl spies fi di lait spred.</p>
<p>“No si notn, sa.”</p>
<p>“Turn up all hands an mek sail! him travel faster dan mi did tink fi;—di top-gallant sails!—aye, dem shuda did keep pan har all night. But no matter—'tis but resting fi di rush.”</p>
<p>Yahso be it seh, dat dis pertinacious pursuit a one particular whale, continued thru day into night, an thru night into day, a one ting by no means unprecedented inna di South sea fishery. Fi such a di wonderful skill, prescience a experience, an invincible confidence weh some great natural geniuses did get mongst di Nantucket commander dem; dat fram di simple observation a one whale wen dem laas diskraib it, dem wi, anda certain gien circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both di direction in which him ago continue fi swim fi a time, while out a sight, as well as him probable rate a progression during dat deh period. An, inna dem case yah, somewhat as a pilot, wen bout losing sight a one coast, whose general trending him well know, an weh him desire shortly fi return to again, but at some further point; like as dis pilot stan up by him compass, an tek di precise bearing a di cape at present visible, in order di more certainly fi hit aright di remote, unseen headland, eventually fi be visited: so does di fisherman, at him compass, wid di whale; fi afta dem did a chase, an diligently mark, chruu several hours a daylight, den, wen nait obscure di fish, di creature's future wake thru di darkness is almost as established to di sagacious mind a di hunter, as di pilot's coast is to him. So dat to dis hunter's wondrous skill, di proverbial evanescence a one ting writ inna water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as di steadfast land. An as di mighty iron Leviathan a di modern railway is so familiarly known inna it every pace, dat, wid watches inna dem han, man time him rate as doctors dat a baby's pulse; an lightly say of it, di up train or di down train ago reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, deh deh occasions wen dem Nantucketers deh time dat deh other Leviathan a di deep, according to di observed humor a him speed; an seh to demself, so many hours hence dis whale ago have gone two hundred miles, ago bout reach dis or dat deh degree a latitude or longitude. But fi mek dis acuteness at all successful inna di end, di wind an di sea haffi be di whaleman's allies; fi weh present avail to di becalmed or windbound mariner is di skill weh assure him him deh exactly ninety-three leagues an a quarter fram him port? Inferable fram dem statements yah, a plenty collateral subtile matters touching di chase a whales.</p>
<p>Di ship tore on; lef such a furrow inna di sea as wen a cannon-ball, missent, become a plough-share an turn up di level field.</p>
<p>“By salt an hemp!” Stubb baal out, "but dis swift motion a di deck creep up one's legs an tingles at di heart. Dis ship an mi a two brave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one tek mi up, an launch mi, spine-wise, pan di sea,—for by live-oaks! mi spine's a keel. Ha, hait we no leave di dust behind!"</p>
<p>“Deh deh she blow—she blow!—she blow!—right ahead!” was now di mast-head cry.</p>
<p>“Aye, aye!” Stubb baal out, “Mi did nuo it—yu kyaahn ron we—blow aan an split yu spait, O whale! di mad fiend imself a fala yu! blow yu trump—blister yu lung dem!—Ahab ago dam aaf yu blod, az a miller shet im waata giet pan di riva!”</p>
<p>An Stubb did but speak out fi well nigh all dat deh crew. Di frenzies a di chase did by dis time work dem bubblingly up, like old wine work anew. Wateva pale fears an forebodings some a dem mighta did feel before; dem deh neva only now kept out a sight chruu di growing awe a Ahab, but dem did brok up, an pan all sides routed, as timid prairie hares weh scatter before di bounding bison. Di han a Fate did tek weh all a dem soul; an by di stirring perils a di previous day; di rack a di past night's suspense; di fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which dem wild craft did a go plung towards it flying mark; by all dem ting deh, dem heart did bowled along. Di wind weh mek big bellies a dem sail, an rush di vessel on wid arms invisible as irresistible; dis did look like di symbol a dat deh unseen agency weh so enslave dem to di race.</p>
<p>Dem a did wan man, no toti. For as di one ship weh did a hold dem all; though it did put tugeda wid all contrasting tings—oak, an maple, an pine wood; iron, an pitch, an hemp—yet all dem run into each other inna di one concrete hull, weh did a shot pan it way, both balanced an directed by di long central keel; even so, all di individualities a di crew, dis man's valor, dat deh man's fear; guilt an guiltiness, all varieties dem did welded into oneness, an dem did all direct to dat fatal goal weh Ahab dem one lord an keel did point to.</p>
<p>Di rigging did live. Di mast-heads, like di tops a tall palms, did outspreadingly tufted wid arms an legs. Clinging to a spar wid one han, some reach forth di other wid impatient wavings; ada people, shading dem eyes fram di vivid sunlight, did a sidong far out pan di rocking yards; all di spars inna full bearing a mortals, ready an ripe fi dem fate. Ah! ou dem stil a chrai chuu dat de infinite bluunis fi luk out fi di ting we maita mash dem op!</p>
<p>“Wa mek unu no sing out fi im, if unu si im?” cried Ahab, wen, afta di lapse a some minutes since di first cry, no more neva did hear. “Sway mi up, man; yuh get deceive; not Moby Dick cast one odd jet dat way, an den disappear.”</p>
<p>It did even so; inna dem headlong eagerness, di man dem did mistaken some ada ting fi di whale-spout, as di event itself soon prove; fi hardly Ahab did reach him perch; hardly did di rope belayed to it pin pan deck, wen him struck di key-note to an orchestra, weh mek di air vibrate as wid di combined discharges a rifles. Di triumphant halloo a thirty buckskin lungs did hear, as—much nearer to di ship dan di place a di imaginary jet, less dan a mile ahead—Moby Dick bodily burst inna view! For not by any calm an indolent spoutings; not by di peaceable gush a dat deh mystic fountain inna him head, did di White Whale now reveal him vicinity; but by di far more wondrous phenomenon a breaching. Rising wid him utmost velocity fram di furthest depths, di Sperm Whale thus boom him entire bulk inna di pure element a air, an piling up a mountain a dazzling foam, show him place to di distance a seven miles an more. Inna dem deh moment deh, di torn, enraged waves dem weh him shake off, seem him mane; inna some cases, dis breaching a him act a defiance.</p>
<p>“A de so shi a brok, a de so shi a brok!” was di cry, as inna him immeasurable bravadoes di White Whale toss himself salmon-like to Heaven. So suddenly seen inna di blue plain a di sea, an relieved against di still bluer margin a di sky, di spray weh him raise, fi di moment, intolerably glitter an glare like a glacier; an stan deh gradually fading an fading weh fram it first sparkling intensity, to di dim mistiness a one advancing shower inna a vale.</p>
<p>“Aye, breach yuh last to di sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “yuh hour an yuh harpoon deh deh!—Down! dung all a unu, but one man at di fore. Di boats dem!—stand by!”</p>
<p>Unmindful a di tedious rope-ladders a di shrouds, di man dem, like shooting stars, slid to di deck, by di isolated backstays an halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly did get drop fram him perch.</p>
<p>“Lower away,” him cry, so soon as him did reach him boat—a spare one, rigged di aftanuun before. “Mr. Starbuck, di ship a fi yuh—keep weh fram di boat dem, but keep near dem. Lower, all!”</p>
<p>As if fi strike a quick terror inna dem, by dis time being di first assailant himself, Moby Dick did turn, an did a come now fi di three crews. Ahab's boat did deh central; an chering him man dem, him tell dem seh him woulda tek di whale head-an-head,—dat is, pull straight up to him forehead,—a not uncommon ting; fi wen widin a certain limit, such a course exclude di coming onset fram di whale's sidelong vision. But ere dat close limit was gained, an while yet all three boats did plain as di ship's three masts to him eye; di White Whale churning himself inna furious speed, almost inna an instant as it were, rush mongst di boats dem wid open jaws, an a lashing tail, offering appalling battle pan every side; an heedless a di irons dem weh did a darted at him fram every boat, seemed only intent fi annihilate each separate plank weh dem boat deh did mek outa. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers inna di field; di boats dem fi a while eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank's breadth; while all di time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.</p>
<p>But at last inna him untraceable evolutions, di White Whale so cross an recross, an in a thousand ways entangle di slack a di three lines dem weh now fast to him, dat dem foreshorten, an, a demself, warp di devoted boats towards di planted irons inna him; though now fi a moment di whale draw aside a likkle, as if fi rally fi a more tremendous charge. Seizing dat deh opportunity, Ahab fos pay out more line: an den him did a rapidly hauling an jerking in pan it again—hoping dat way fi disencumber it a some snarls—wen lo!—a sight more savage dan di embattled teeth a sharks!</p>
<p>Caught an twisted—corkscrewed inna di mazes a di line, loose harpoons an lances, wid all dem bristling barbs an points, come flashing an dripping up to di chocks inna di bows a Ahab's boat. Only one ting coulda be done. Seizing di boat-knife, him critically reach widin—through—an den, widout—di rays a steel; drag inna di line beyond, pass it, inboard, to di bowsman, an den, twice sundering di rope near di chocks—drop di intercepted faggot a steel inna di sea; an did all fast again. Dat instant, di White Whale mek a sudden rush mongx di remaining tangles a di ada lines; by so doing, irresistibly drag di more involved boats a Stubb an Flask towards him flukes; dash dem tugeda like two rolling husks pan a surf-beaten beach, an den, dive dung inna di sea, disappear inna a boiling maelstrom, in which, fi a space, di odorous cedar chips a di wrecks did a dance round an round, like di grated nutmeg inna a swiftly stirred bowl a punch.</p>
<p>While di two crews dem did a circle inna di waters, a reach out afta di revolving line-tubs, oars, an other floating furniture, while aslope likkle Flask did a bob up an dung like an empty vial, a twitch him legs upwards fi escape di dreaded jaws a sharks; an Stubb did a lustily sing out fi some one fi ladle him up; an while di ole man's line—now parting—admitted of him pulling inna di creamy pool fi rescue whom him coulda;—in dat deh wild simultaneousness a a thousand concreted perils,—Ahab's yet unstricken boat did look like dem did a draw up towards Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, perpendicularly perpendicular fram di White Whaa, broad forehead against it bottom, an sen it, turning ova an ova, inna di air; til it fall again—gunwale dung—an Ahab an him man dem struggle out fram unda it, like seals fram a sea-side cave.</p>
<p>Di fos uprising momentum a di whale—modifying it direction as him struck di surface—involuntarily launch him along it, to a likkle distance fram di center a di destruction him did mek; an wid him back to it, him now lay fi a moment slowly feeling wid him flukes fram side to side; an weneva a stray oar, bit a plank, di least chip or crumb a di boats touch him skin, him tail swiftly draw back, an come sideways smiting di sea. But soon, as if satisfied seh him work fi dat deh time did done, him push him pleated forehead chruu di ocean, an trailing afta him di intertangled lines, continue him leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.</p>
<p>As before, di attentive ship having describe di whole fight, again come bearing dung to di rescue, an drop a boat, pick up di floating mariners, tubs, oars, an whatever else coulda be catch at, an safely land dem pan har decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, an ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons an lances; inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars an planks; all dem did deh deh; but no fatal or even serious ill did look like it did befallen any one. As wid Fedallah di day before, so Ahab did now find grimly clinging to him boat's broken half, weh did afford a comparatively easy float; nor it did so exhaust him as di previous day's mishap.</p>
<p>But wen dem help him to di deck, all eyes did fasten pan him; as instead a stan up by himself him still half-hung upon di shoulda a Starbuck, who did thus far been di foremost fi assist him. Him ivory leg did get snap off, lef only one short sharp splinter.</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet fi lean sometimes, be di leaner who him will; an would old Ahab did lean oftener dan him have.”</p>
<p>“Di ferrule neva stan op, sa,” di carpenter seh, now a come up; “Mi put good work inna dat deh leg.”</p>
<p>“But no bones broken, sir, mi hope,” Stubb seh wid true concern.</p>
<p>“Aye! an all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d'ye see it.—But even wid a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; an mi account no living bone a mi one jot more mi, dan dis dead one weh lost. Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab inna him owner and can lead any proper. touch yonder floor, any mast scrape yonder roof?—Aloft deh which way?”</p>
<p>“Dead to leeward, sir.”</p>
<p>“Up helm, den; pile pan di siel agen, ship kiipa! dong di res a di spier buot dem an rig dem—Mista Staarbak we, an muster di buot kruu dem.”</p>
<p>“Mek mi help yuh fos towards di bulwarks, sir.”</p>
<p>“Oh, oh, oh! how dis splinter gores mi now! Accursed fate! dat di unconquerable captain inna di soul shuda have such a craven mate!”</p>
<p>"Sar?"</p>
<p>“Mi body, man, not yuh. Gi mi someting fi a cane—deh, dat deh shivered lance ago do. Muster di man dem. Surely mi neva si him yet. By heaven it cyaan be!—missing?—quick! call dem all.”</p>
<p>Di uol man hint ting did chuu. Wen dem did a muster di company, di Parsee neva deh deh.</p>
<p>“Di Parsee!” Stubb baal out—“im mosi get kech inna——”</p>
<p>“Di black vomit wrench yuh!—run all a unu above, alow, cabin, forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”</p>
<p>But quickly dem return to him wid di tidings dat di Parsee neva deh noweh fi find.</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” seh Stubb—“caught mongst di tangles a yuh line—mi did tink mi si him a drag unda.”</p>
<p>“ <i>Mi</i> line! <i>mi</i> line? Gone?—gone? Weh mean dat likkle word?—Weh death-knell ring inna it, dat old Ahab shake as if him a di belfry. Di harpoon, too!—toss ova di litter deh,—d'ye see it?—di forged iron, man, di white whale's—noblied, no fostered,—did fort dis han! it!—'tis inna di fish!—Aloft deh! daiv chriet chuu it, bot mi wi kil im yet!”</p>
<p>“Great God! but fi one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck; “neva, neva yuh will capture him, old man—Inna Jesus's name no more a dis, dat's worse dan devil's madness. Two days chase; two times stove to splinters; yuh very leg once more snatched fram unda yuh; yuh evil shadow gone—all good angels mobbing yuh wid warning—weh yuh woulda keep more? chasing dis murderous fish til him swamp di last man? Shall wi be drag by him to di infernal world?</p>
<p>“Starbuck, a late mi did feel strangely moved to yuh; ever since dat hour we both did si—you know weh, inna one anoda's eyes. But inna dis matter a di whale, be di front a yuh face to mi as di palm a dis han—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab a fi eva Ahab, dis a imcretable man. 'Twas rehearsed by yuh an mi one billion years before dis ocean rolled. Mi a di Fates' lieutenant; Look you, underling dat yuh obeyed mine. body's part; but Ahab soul a one centipede, weh <i>move</i> pan a hundred legs. Mi feel strained, half stranded, as ropes weh tow dismasted frigates inna a gale; inna di tings dem weh dem call omens? Den laugh loud, an cry encore! For ere dem drown, drawning tings ago rise to di surface two times; den rise again, fi sink fi evermore.</p>
<p>“As fearless fire,” Stubb baal out.</p>
<p>“An as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Den as di man dem did a goh forward, him mutter on: “Di tings dem weh dem call omens! An yesterday mi did a talk di same ting to Starbuck deh, bout mi broken boat. Oh! how valiantly mi a try fi drive out a others heart weh clinched so fast inna mine!—Di Parsee—di Parsee!—gone, an him did still fi see again: Mi coulda perish—How's dat?—Deh deh a riddle now weh might baffle all di lawyers backed by di ghosts a di whole line a judges:—like a hawk's beak it peck mi brain <i>I'll</i> , <i>I'll</i> solve it, though!”</p>
<p>Wen di die kom dong, di whale did still deh inna di sight to leeward.</p>
<p>So once more di sail did shorten, an everyting pass nearly as pan di previous night; only, di sound a hammers, an di hum a di grindstone did hear til nearly daylight, as di man dem did a toil wid lanterns inna di complete an careful rigging a di spare boats an sharpen dem fresh weapons fi di morrow. Meantime, a di broken keel a Ahab's wrecked craft di carpenter mek him anodda leg; wile still as pan di night before, slouched Ahab did a stan up fix widin him scuttle; him hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward pan it dial; sidong chuu di iis fi di fos son.</p>
