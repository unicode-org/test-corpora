<h2 id="pgepubid00094">CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish an Loose-Fish.</h2>
<p>Di allusion to di waif an waif-poles inna di last chapter but one, necessitate some account a di laws an regulations a di whale fishery, a weh di waif maita be deemed di grand symbol an badge.</p>
<p>It frequently happen dat wen several ships a cruise inna company, a whale may get hit by one vessel, den escape, an get finally kill an capture by anodda vessel; an yaso dem indirectly comprised plenty minor contingencies, all a dem a tek paat a dis one grand feature. Fi egzampl,—afta a weary an perilous chase an capture a wan whale, di body maita get loose fram di ship bai riizn a wan violent storm; an drifting far away to leeward, be retake by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, widout risk of life or line. So di most vexatious an violent disputes woulda often arise between di fishermen, if deh neva have some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases.</p>
<p>Perhaps di only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was dat of Holland. It did decree by di States-General inna AD 1695. But though no ada nation neva have no written whaling law, yet di American fishermen dem did a dem own legislators an lawyers inna dis matter. Dem provide a system weh fi terse comprehensiveness surpass Justinian's Pandects an di By-laws a di Chinese Society fi di Suppression a Meddling wid ada People's Business. Yea; dem laws yah might be engraven pan a Queen Anne's farthing, or di barb a harpoon, an wear roun di neck, so small dem deh.</p>
<p>I. A Fast-Fish belong to di party fast to it.</p>
<p>II. A Loose-Fish a fair game fi anybody weh can soonest catch it.</p>
<p>But weh play di mischief wid dis masterly code a di admirable brevity a it, weh necessitate a vast volume a commentaries fi expound it.</p>
<p>Fos: Weh a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish technically fast, wen it connect wid an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all controllable by di occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand a cobweb, it is all di same. Likewise a fish is technically fast wen it bear a waif, or any other recognized symbol of possession; so lang as di party waifing it plainly evince dem ability at any time fi tek it alongside, as well as dem intention so fi do.</p>
<p>Dis a scientific commentaries; but di commentaries a di whalemen demself sometimes consist inna hard words an harder knocks—di Coke-upon-Littleton a di fist. True, mongst di more upright an honorable whalemen allowance dem always mek fi peculiar cases, weh it woulda be an outrageous moral injustice fi one party fi claim possession a a whale weh dem did chase or kill by anodda party. But ada people dem nuh so scrupulous.</p>
<p>Som fifty years ago deh did have a curious case a whale-trover litigated inna England, weh di plaintiffs dem did set out seh afta a hard chase a one whale inna di Northern seas; an wen indeed dem (di plaintiffs) did succeed inna harpooning di fish; dem did at last, chruu peril a dem life, obliged fi lef not only dem lines, but dem boat itself. Ultimately di defendants (di crew a anodda ship) come up wid di whale, strike, kill, seize, an finally appropriate it before di very eyes a di plaintiffs. An wen dem defendants deh did a get rimonstrated wid, dem captain snap him finga dem inna di plaintiffs dem teet, an assure dem seh by way a doxology to di deed him did done, him woulda now retain dem line, harpoons, an boat, weh did remain attached to di whale at di time a di seizure. So di plaintiffs dem now sue fi di recovery a di value a dem whale, line, harpoons, an boat.</p>
<p>Mr. Erskine was counsel fi di defendants; Lord Ellenborough was di judge. Inna di course a di defence, di witty Erskine goh on fi illustrate him position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, weh a gentleman, afta inna vain trying fi bridle him wife's viciousness, did at last abandon har pan di seas a life; but inna di course a years, repenting a dat deh step, him institute an action fi recover possession a har. Erskine did deh pan di ada side; an him den support it by saying, dat though di gentleman did originally harpoon di lady, an did once had har fast, an only by reason a di great stress a har plunging viciousness, did at last abandon har; yet abandon har him did, so dat she become a loose-fish; an so wen a subsequent gentleman re-harpoon har, di lady den become dat subsequent gentleman's property, along wid whatever harpoon mighta did find sticking inna har.</p>
<p>Now inna di present case Erskine did a contend seh di examples a di whale an di lady did reciprocally illustrative a each other.</p>
<p>Dem pleadings, an di counter pleadings, being duly heard, di very learned judge in set terms decide, to wit,—Dat as fi di boat, him award it to di plaintiffs, cause dem did merely abandon it fi save dem life; but dat wid regard to di controverted whale, harpoons, an line, dem belong to di defendants; di whale, cause it was a Loose-Fish at di time a di final capture; an di harpoons an line cause wen di fish mek off wid dem, it (di fish) get a property inna dem deh articles; an so anybody weh aftawod tek di fish did have a right to dem. Now di defendants dem aftawards tek di fish; ergo, di aforesaid articles dem was fi dem.</p>
<p>A common man weh a look pan dis decision a di very learned Judge, might possibly object to it. But plow up to di primary rock a di matter, di two great principles dem weh did lay dung inna di twin whaling laws dem weh did quote before, an weh did apply an elucidate by Lord Ellenborough inna di above cited case; dem two laws yah weh touch Fast-Fish an Loose-Fish, mi seh, wi, pan reflection, be found di fundamentals a all human jurisprudence; fi notwithstanding di complicated tracery a sculpture, di Temple a di Laa, laik di Temple a di Philistines, have only two props fi stan pan.</p>
<p>It nuh seh inna everybody mout, Possession is half a di law: dat mean, regardless a how di ting come inna possession? But often possession is di whole a di law. Weh a di sinews an souls a Russian serfs an Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, weh possession a di whole a di law? Weh to di rapacious landlord is di widow's last mite but a Fast-Fish? Weh is yonder undetected villain's marble mansion wid a door-plate fi a waif; weh dat is but a Fast-Fish? Weh a di ruinous discount weh Mordecai, di broker, get fram poor Woebegone, di bankrupt, pan a loan fi keep Woebegone's family fram starvation; weh dat deh ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? Weh di Archbishop a Savesoul's income a £100,000 weh dem tek fram di scant bread an cheese a hundreds a thousands a broken-backed laborers (all sure a heaven widout any a Savesoul's help) weh a dat deh globular £100,000 but a Fast-Fish? Weh di Duke of Dunder's hereditary towns an hamlets dem but Fast-Fish? Weh to dat deh redoubted harpooneer, John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? Weh to dat deh apostolic lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? An bout all a dem ya ting, Possession a nuh di whole a di law?</p>
<p>But if di doctrine a Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, di kindred doctrine a Loose-Fish is still more widely so. Dat is internationally an universally applicable.</p>
<p>Weh America inna 1492 was but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus strike di Spanish standard by way a waifing it fi him royal master an mistress? Weh Poland was to di Czar? Weh Greece to di Turk? Weh India to England? Weh Mexico ago be to di United States? All Loose-Fish.</p>
<p>Weh a di Rights a Man an di Liberties a di World but Loose-Fish? Weh all man's minds an opinions but Loose-Fish? Weh a di principle a religious belief inna dem but a Loose-Fish? Weh to di ostentatious smuggling verbalists dem a di thoughts a thinkers but Loose-Fish? Weh di great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? An weh yuh, reader, but a Loose-Fish an a Fast-Fish, too?</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00095">CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.</h2>
<p>“De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, an regina caudam.” <i>Bracton, l. 3, c. 3.</i></p>
<p>Latin fram di buk dem a di Laa a Ingglan, weh tek lang wid di kantex, miin, se a aal wail animal we enibadi kech pan di kuos a dat de lan, di King, az Honorary Grand Harpooneer, afi av di ed, an di Kwiin afi get rispek wid di tiel. A division weh, inna di whale, is much like halving an apple; no intermediate remainder nuh deh. Now as dis law, unda a modified form, is to dis day in force inna England; an as it offer in various respects a strange anomaly touching di general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is yah treated of inna a separate chapter, pan di same courteous principle weh prompt di English railways fi be at di expense a one separate car, specially reserved fi di accommodation a royalty. Inna di fos place, inna curious proof a di fact seh di above-mentioned law still inna force, mi proceed fi lay before yuh a circumstance weh happen widin di last two years.</p>
<p>It look like some honest mariners a Dover, or Sandwich, or some one a di Cinque Ports, did afta a hard chase successed fi kill an beach a fine whale weh dem did originally describe far off fram di shore. Now di Cinque Ports dem deh partially or somehow unda di jurisdiction a one sort a policeman or beadle, weh dem call a Lord Warden. Holding di office directly fram di crown, mi believe, all di royal emoluments incident to di Cinque Port territories become by assignment his. By some writers dis office is called a sinecure. But not so. Bikaaz di Lord Warden busy employ at times inna fobbing him perquisites; weh a him chiefly by virtue a dat deh same fobbing a dem.</p>
<p>Now wen dem poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, an wid dem trowsers roll high up pan dem eely legs, did wearily haul dem fat fish high an dry, promising demself a good £150 fram di precious oil an bone; an inna fantasy sipping rare tea wid dem wives, an good ale wid dem cronies, pan di strength a dem respective shares; up steps a very learned an most Christian an charitable gentleman, wid a copy a Blackstone unda him arm; an put it pan di whale head, im seh—“Hands off! dis fish, mi masters, a one Fast-Fish. Mi seize it as di Lord Warden's.” Pan dis di poor mariners inna dem respectful consternation—so truly English—knowing not weh fi seh, fall to vigorously scratching dem head all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing fram di whale to di stranger. But dat did in no way mend di matter, or at all soften di hard heart a di learned gentleman wid di copy a Blackstone. At length one a dem, afta long scratching bout fi him ideas, mek bold fi speak,</p>
<p>“Please, sir, who is di Lord Warden?”</p>
<p>“Di Duke.”</p>
<p>“But di duke neva have nutten fi duh wid tek dis fish?”</p>
<p>“A fi him.”</p>
<p>“Wi did deh inna great trouble, an peril, an some expense, an is all dat fi go to di Duke's benefit; wi nuh get nutten at all fi wi pains but wi blisters?”</p>
<p>“A fi him.”</p>
<p>“Di Duke so very poor as fi be forced to dis desperate mode a getting a livelihood?”</p>
<p>“A fi him.”</p>
<p>“Mi did tink fi relieve mi ole bed-ridden mada by part a mi share a dis whale.”</p>
<p>“A fi him.”</p>
<p>“Di Duke naa go be content wid a quarter or a half?”</p>
<p>“A fi him.”</p>
<p>Inna a word, di whale did get seize an sell, an him Grace di Duke of Wellington did get di money. Thinking dat viewed in some particular lights, di case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed, unda di circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to him Grace, begging him fi tek di case a dem deh unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which mi Lord Duke in substance reply (both letters did publish) seh him did already done so, an get di money, an woulda be obliged to di reverend gentleman if fi di future him (di reverend gentleman) woulda decline meddling wid other people's business. Dis a di still militant old man, weh a stan up a di corner a di three kingdoms, pan all han a coerce alms a beggars?</p>
<p>It wi readily be seen seh inna dis case di alleged right a di Duke to di whale was a delegated one fram di Sovereign. Wi haffi needs inquire den pan weh principle di Sovereign is originally invested wid dat deh right. Di law itself don set out aredi. But Plowdon gi wi di reason fi it. Plowdon seh, di whale weh dem ketch so belong to di King an Queen, “because a it superior excellence.” An by di soundest commentators dis eva been hold a cogent argument in such matters.</p>
<p>Bot wa mek di King fi av di ed, an di Kwiin fi av di tiel? A reason fi dat, unu lawyers!</p>
<p>Inna him treatise pan “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King's Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen's, dat ye Queen's wardrobe may be supply wid ye whalebone.” Now dis was write at a time wen di black limber bone a di Greenland or Right whale did largely use inna ladies's bodices. But dis same bone nuh deh inna di tail; it deh inna di head, weh a one sad mistake fi a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But di Queen a one mermaid, fi get present wid a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk yah.</p>
<p>Deh deh two royal fish so style by di English law writers—di whale an di sturgeon; both royal property anda certain limitations, an nominally supply di tenth branch a di crown's ordinary revenue. Mi no know seh no ada author did hint bout di matter; but by inference it seems to mi dat di sturgeon mus be divided inna di same way as di whale, di King a get di highly dense an elastic head peculiar to dat deh fish, weh, symbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. An so it look like a reason inna all tings, even inna law.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00096">CHAPTER 91. Di Pequod Meets Di Rose-Bud.</h2>
<p>“In vain it was fi rake fi Ambergriese inna di paunch a dis Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” <i>Sir T. Browne, VE</i></p>
<p>A did a week or two afta di last whaling scene did a taak bout, an wen wi did a slowly sailing ova a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, dat di many noses dem pan di Pequod's deck did prove more vigilant discoverers dan di three pairs a eyes aloft. A peculiar an not very pleasant smell did a smel inna di sea.</p>
<p>“Mi ago bet someting now,” seh Stubb, “dat somwe yaso a som a dem drugged whale weh wi did a tickle di ada day. Mi did tink dem woulda keel up before lang.”</p>
<p>Presently, di vapors in advance slid aside; an deh inna di distance did a ship, weh furled sail dem did a betoken seh some sort a whale mus deh alongside. As wi did a glide nearer, di stranger did a show French colors fram him peak; an by di eddying cloud a vulture sea-fowl weh did a circle, an hover, an swoop roun him, it was plain seh di whale alongside mus be weh di fishermen dem call a blasted whale, dat is, a whale weh did dead unmolested pan di sea, an so float an unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse dan an Assyrian city inna di plague, wen di living dem incompetent fi bury di dead. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, dat no cupidity coulda persuade dem fi moor alongside a it. Yet deh deh some who will still do it; notwithstanding di fact dat di oil weh yuh get fram dem deh subject deh a one very inferior quality, an by no means a di nature a attar-of-rose.</p>
<p>Coming still nearer wid di expiring breeze, wi si seh di Frenchman did have a secan whale alongside; an dis secan whale did look even more a nosegay dan di first one. In truth, it turn out fi be one a dem problematical whales weh seem fi dry up an die wid a sort a prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; lef dem defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt a anyting like oil. Nevertheless, inna di proper place we shall see seh no knowing fisherman will eva turn up him nose at such a whale as dis, however much him may shun blasted whales in general.</p>
<p>Di Pequod did now sweep so nigh to di stranger, dat Stubb vowed him recognize him cutting spade-pole entangled inna di lines dem weh did knot roun di tail a one a dem whales deh.</p>
<p>“A wan priti fellow, now,” im banteringly laugh, stan op inna di ship bows, “a jackal fi yuh! Mi well know seh dem Crappoes a Frenchman yah a jus poor devils inna di fishery; sometimes dem a lower dem boats fi breakers, mistaking dem fi Sperm Whale spouts, dem a seel fram dem full a port; boxes a tallow candles, an cases a snuffers, foreseeing dat all di oil dem ago get naa go be enough fi dip di Captain's wick inna; aye, wi all know dem ting deh; devil! Mi seh, pass round a hat, some one, an mek wi mek him a present a likkle oil fi dear charity's sake. Fi weh oil him ago get fram dat deh drugged whale deh, wouldn't be fit fi burn inna a jail; wi, dan him ago get fram dat deh bundle a bones; though, now dat mi tink bout it, it may contain someting weh worth a good deal more dan oil; an so seh him staat fi di quarter-deck.</p>
<p>By dis time di faint air did become a complete calm; so dat weda or no, di Pequod did now fairly entrap inna di smell, wid no hope fi escape except by it breezing up again. Issuing fram di cabin, Stubb now call him boat's crew, an pull off fi di stranger. Drawing across har bow, him perceived seh in accordance wid di fanciful French taste, di upper part a har stem-piece did carve inna di likeness a one huge drooping stalk, did paint green, an fi thorns did have copper spikes weh did a project fram it yah an deh; di whole terminating inna a symmetrical folded bulb a bright red colour. Pan har head boards, inna big gilt letters, him read “Bouton de Rose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; an dis was di romantic name a dis aromatic ship.</p>
<p>Though Stubb neva andastan di <i>Bouton</i> paat a di inscription, yet di wod <i>rose</i> , an di bulbous figure-head put tugeda, sufficiently explain di whole to him.</p>
<p>“A wooden rose-bud, eh?” him baal out wid him han to him nose, “dat ago do very well; but how like all creation it smell!”</p>
<p>Now fi hold direct communication wid di people dem pan deck, him haffi pull round di bows to di starboard side, an so come close to di blasted whale; an so talk ova it.</p>
<p>Arrived den at dis spot, wid one han still to him nose, him bawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! deh deh any a unu Bouton-de-Roses weh speak English?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man fram di bulwarks, who turn out fi be di chief-mate.</p>
<p>“Well, den, mi Bouton-de-Rose-bud, yuh si di White Whale?”</p>
<p>“ <i>Weh</i> whale?”</p>
<p>“Di <i>White</i> Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, yuh si him?</p>
<p>“Neva hear bout such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”</p>
<p>“Veri gud, den; gud bai nou, an mi wi kaal agen ina wan minit.”</p>
<p>Den rapidly pulling back towards di Pequod, an si Ahab a lean ova di quarter-deck rail a wait fi him report, him mold him two han dem inna a trumpet an shout—“No, Sir! No!” Afta dat Ahab retire, an Stubb return to di Frenchman.</p>
<p>Im now perceive seh di Guernsey-man, weh did jus get inna di chains, an did a use a cutting-spade, did slung im nose inna a sort a bag.</p>
<p>“Weh di mata wid yuh nose, deh?” Stubb seh. “Broke it?”</p>
<p>“Mi wish it did brok, ar se mi neva av no nuoz at aal!” ansa di Guernsey-man, who neva did look like him did a relish di job weh him did a do very much. “But weh yuh a hold <i>yuh own</i> fah?”</p>
<p>“Oh, notn! A wan wax nose; mi haffi hold it on. Fine day, ain't it? Air rather gardenny, mi shuda seh; throw wi a bunch a posies, will yuh, Bouton-de-Rose?”</p>
<p>“Weh inna di devil's name yuh waan yah?” roar di Guernseyman, flying into a sudden passion.</p>
<p>“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, dat a di wod! why yuh nuh pack dem whale deh inna ice while yuh a work pan dem? But joking aside, though; yuh know, Rose-bud, seh a all nonsense fi try get any oil outa dem deh whale deh? As fi dat dry up one, deh, him neva gill inna him whole carcase.”</p>
<p>"Mi know dat well enough; but, d'ye see, di Captain yah naa go believe it; dis a him first voyage; him was a Cologne manufacturer before. But come abord, an mayhap him wi believe yuh, if him nuh waan mi; an so mi wi get outa dis dirty scrape."</p>
<p>“Anyting fi oblige yuh, mi sweet an pleasant fellow,” Stubb seh agen, an wid dat him soon mount to di deck. Deh deh a queer scene present itself. Di sailors, inna tasselled caps a red worsted, did a get di heavy tackles inna readiness fi di whales. But dem did a work rada slow an did a taak very fast, an dem did a look inna anyting but a good humor. All dem noses upwardly projected fram dem face like so many jib-booms. Now an den pairs a dem woulda drop dem work, an run up to di mast-head fi get some fresh air. Som a dem did tink dem woulda ketch di plague, dip oakum inna coal-tar, an at intervals hold it to dem nostrils. Ada people weh did break di stems a dem pipe dem almost short off at di bowl, dem did a puff tobacco-smoke vigorously, so dat it constantly did a full dem olfactories.</p>
<p>Stubb did get hit by a shower a outcries an anathemas weh did a come fram di Captain's round-house abaft; an looking inna dat deh direction si a fiery face thrust fram behind di door, weh did a hold ajar fram widin. Dis was di tormented surgeon, who, afta in vain remonstrating against di proceedings of di day, did betaken himself to di Captain's round-house ( <i>cabinet</i> him called it) fi avoid di pest; but still, couldn't help yelling out him begries an indignations at times.</p>
<p>Marking all dis, Stubb argue well fi him scheme, an turning to di Guernsey-man did have a likkle chat wid him, during which di stranger mate express him detestation a him Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who did bring dem all inna so unsavory an unprofitable a pickle. Sound him carefully, Stubb further perceived dat di Guernsey-man neva have di slightest suspicion bout di ambergris. So him did a hold him peace pan dat deh head, but otherwise him did quite frank an confidential wid him, so dat di two a dem quickly concoct a likkle plan fi both circumvent an satirize di Captain, widout him at all dreaming of distrust dem sincerity. According to dis likkle plan a dem, di Guernsey-man, unda cover a one interpreter's office, did fi tell di Captain weh him did like, but as coming fram Stubb; an as fi Stubb, him did fi utter any nonsense weh shuda come uppermost inna him during di interview.</p>
<p>By dis time dem destined victim appear fram him cabin. Im was a likkle an dark, but rather delicate looking man fi a sea-captain, wid big whiskers an moustache, however; an did a wear a red cotton velvet vest wid watch-seals at him side. Tu dis gentleman, Stubb did now politely introduced by di Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on di aspect a interpreting between dem.</p>
<p>“Weh mi fi seh to him fos?” him seh.</p>
<p>“Why,” Stubb seh, a look pan di velvet vest an di watch an seals, “yuh may as well staat by telling him seh him look a sort a babyish to mi, though mi nuh pretend fi be a judge.”</p>
<p>“Im seh, Monsieur,” di Guernsey-man seh, inna French, an ton tu im captain, “dat ongl yeside im ship did a taak bout a vessel, weh im captain an chief-mate, wid six sailors, did aal ded fram a fever weh dem did kech fram a blasted whale weh dem did bring langsaid.”</p>
<p>Pan dis di captain staat, an eagerly did waan know more.</p>
<p>“Weh now?” di Guernsey-man seh to Stubb.</p>
<p>“Why, since him tek it so easy, tell him seh now mi have eyed him carefully, mi quite certain seh him no more fit fi command a whale-ship dan a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him fram mi seh him a baboon.”</p>
<p>“Im vow an declare, Monsieur, seh di ada whale, di dried one, is far more deadly dan di blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, him conjure wi, as wi value wi life, fi cut loose fram dem fish yah.”</p>
<p>Instantly di captain run forward, an inna a loud voice command him crew fi desist fram hoist di cutting-tackles, an at once cast loose di cables an chains weh did a confine di whales to di ship.</p>
<p>“Weh now?” seh di Guernsey-man, wen di Captain did come back to dem.</p>
<p>“Why, mek mi si; yes, yuh can as well tell him now dat—dat—in fact, tell him seh mi did diddle him, an (aside to himself) perhaps somebody else.”</p>
<p>“Im seh, Monsieur, dat im very happy fi have been of any service to wi.”</p>
<p>Wen di captain hear dis, vow seh dem a di grateful parties (meaning himself an mate) an conclude by inviting Stubb dung inna him cabin fi drink a bottle a Bordeaux.</p>
<p>“Im waan yuh fi tek a glass a wine wid him,” di intaprita seh.</p>
<p>“Tangk im aal a unu aat, bot tel im se mi a go jringk wid di man we mi spen wid, an tel im se mi afi go.”</p>
<p>“Im seh, Monsieur, seh im principles dem naa go admit seh im a drink; but seh if Monsieur waan liv wan neda die fi drink, den Monsieur did bes fi drop aal a di four boat dem, an pull di ship weh fram dem whale yah, kaa it so calm dem naa go drift.”</p>
<p>By dis time Stubb did deh ova di side, an get inna him boat, hail di Guernsey-man to dis effect,—seh having a long tow-line inna him boat, him woulda do weh him coulda fi help dem, by pulling out di lighter whale a di two fram di ship's side. While di Frenchman's boats, den, did a tow di ship one way, Stubb benevolently tow weh at him whale di ada way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.</p>
<p>Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned fi cast off fram di whale; hoisting him boats, di Frenchman soon increase him distance, while di Pequod slid in between him an Stubb's whale. Wen Stubb quickly pull to di floating body, an hailing di Pequod fi gi notice a him intentions, at once proceed fi reap di fruit a him unrighteous cunning. Seizing him sharp boat-spade, him staat an excavation inna di body, a likkle behind di side fin. Yuh woulda almost tink seh him did a dig a cellar deh inna di sea; an wen at length him spade hit against di gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles an pottery beri inna fat English loam. Him boat's crew did all inna high excitement, eagerly helping dem chief, an looking as anxious as gold-hunters.</p>
<p>An all di time nuffless fowls did a dive, an duck, an scream, an yelling, an fight roun dem. Stubb did staat fi look disappointed, espeshali az di horrible nosegay did a increase, wen suddenly fram outa di very heart a dis plague, deh did a tiif a faint stream a perfume, weh did a flow chuu di tide a bad smel dem widout get absorb bai it, az wan riva ago flow iin an den lang wid wan neda wan, widout at aal blending wid it fi a taim.</p>
<p>“Mi have it, mi have it,” Stubb baal out, wid delight, a strike someting inna di subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”</p>
<p>Dropping him spade, him thrust both han dem in, an draw out handfuls a someting weh look like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese; very unctuous an savory widal. Yuh might easily dent it wid yuh thumb; it a one hue between yellow an ash colour. An dis, good fren dem, a ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Som six handfuls did get; but more was unavoidably lost inna di sea, an still more, perhaps, mighta been secured if it neva fi impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb fi desist, an come on board, else di ship woulda bid dem good bye.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00097">CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.</h2>
<p>Now dis ambergris a one very curious substance, an so important as an article of commerce, dat inna 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin did get examine at di bar a di English House of Commons pan dat deh subject. Fi dat deh time, an indeed until a comparatively late day, di precise origin a ambergris did remain, like amber itself, a prablem to di learned. Though di wod ambergris a di French compound fi gray amber, yet di two substances dem quite distinct. Fi amber, though at times yuh find pan di sea-coast, is also dig up inna some far inland soils, whereas ambergris yuh neva find except pan di sea. Besides, amber a one hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, weh dem use fi mouth-pieces to pipes, fi beads an ornaments; but ambergris soft, waxy, an so highly fragrant an spicy, dat dem use it largely inna perfumery, inna pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, an pomatum. Di Torks dem use it inna cooking, an also carry it to Mecca, fi di same purpose weh dem carry frankincense to St. Peter's in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains inna claret, fi flavor it.</p>
<p>Who woulda tink, den, seh such fine ladies an gentlemen shuda regale demself wid an essence weh yuh find inna di inglorious bowels a one sick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris suppose to be di cause, an by others di effect, a di dyspepsia inna di whale. How fi cure such a dyspepsia it was hard fi seh, unless by administering three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, an den running out of harm's way, as laborers do inna blasting rocks.</p>
<p>Mi forget fi seh dat deh did find inna dis ambergris, certain hard, round, bony plates, weh at first Stubb did tink mighta be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it aftawards turn out seh dem was notn more dan pieces a likkle squid bones embalmed inna dat deh manner.</p>
<p>Now dat di incorruption a dis most fragrant ambergris shuda be found inna di heart a such decay; dis a nuh nutten? Tingk bout dat weh St. Paul seh inna Corinthians, bout corruption an incorruption; ou wi get plaant iina shiem, bot wi kom bak alaiv wid aal a di powaful sitn dem. An likewise call to mind dat saying of Paracelsus bout weh it mek di bes musk. Also forget not di strange fact dat a all tings a ill-savor, Cologne-water, inna it rudimental manufacturing stages, a di worst.</p>
<p>Mi shuda like fi conclude di chapter wid di above appeal, but can't, owing to mi anxiety fi repel a charge often mek against whalemen, an weh, inna di estimation a some already biased minds, might be considered as indirectly substantiated by weh dem seh bout di Frenchman's two whales. Elsewhere inna dis volume di slanderous aspersion get disproved, seh di vocation a whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But deh deh anodda ting fi rebut. Dem hint seh all whales always smell bad. Now how dis odious stigma did originate?</p>
<p>Mi opinion, seh it plainly traceable to di first arrival a di Greenland whaling ships inna London, more dan two centuries ago. Bikaaz dem whalemen deh neva den, an no try out dem oil at sea laik di Southern ship dem aalwiez du; but cutting up di fresh blubber inna likkle bits, thrust it thru di bung holes a big casks, an carry it home inna dat deh manner; di shortness a di season inna dem deh Icy Seas, an di sudden an violent storms dem weh dem expose to, forbidding any other course. Di consequence is, dat upon breaking into di hold, an unloading one a dem whale cemeteries, inna di Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to dat arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, fi di foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.</p>
<p>Mi partly surmise also, seh dis wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to di existence pan di coast a Greenland, inna former times, a one Dutch village weh dem call Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, weh di latter name a di one weh di learned Fogo Von Slack did use, inna him great work pan Smells, a text-book pan dat deh subject. As it name import (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), dis village did found in order fi afford a place fi di blubber a di Dutch whale fleet fi be try out, widout being tek home to Holland fi dat purpose. A did a collection a furnaces, fat-kettles, an oil sheds; an wen di works dem did a full operation, dem did a gi forth no very pleasant savor. But all dis is quite different wid a South Sea Sperm Whaler; weh inna a voyage a four years perhaps, afta completely full har hold wid oil, nuh, perhaps, consume fifty days inna di business a boiling out; an inna di state weh it casked, di oil nearly scentless. Di truth is, dat living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as di people dem a di middle ages weh did affect fi detect a Jew inna di company, by di nose. Nor indeed can di whale possibly be otherwise dan fragrant, wen, as a general ting, him enjoy such high health; tek plenty a exercise; aalwiez out a duor; though, it is true, seldom inna di open air. Mi seh, dat di motion a one Sperm Whale's flukes above water dispense a perfume, as wen a musk-scented lady rustles har dress inna a warm parlor. Weh den mi fi liken di Sperm Whale to fi fragrance, considering him magnitude? It nuh fi be to dat deh famous elephant, wid jeweled tusks, an redolent wid myrrh, weh dem did lead out a one Indian town fi do honor to Alexander di Great?</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00098">CHAPTER 93. Di Castaway.</h2>
<p>A did but some few days afta dem did encounter di Frenchman, dat a most significant event befell di most insignificant a di Pequod's crew; an event most lamentable; an weh end inna providing di sometimes madly merry an predestinated craft wid a living an ever accompanying prophecy a whatever shattered sequel might prove har own.</p>
<p>Now, inna di whale ship, a nuh every one weh go inna di boat dem. Some few hands dem reserve weh dem call ship-keepers, whose province it is fi work di vessel while di boats dem a pursue di whale. As a general ting, dem ship-keepers yah a as hardy fellows as di man dem weh comprise di boats' crews. But if it happen fi have a unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight inna di ship, dat wight deh certain fi be mek a ship-keeper. It was so inna di Pequod wid di likkle negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! unu don ier bout im bifuo; yuh haffi memba him tambourine pan dat deh dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.</p>
<p>Inna outer aspect, Pip an Dough-Boy mek a match, like a black pony an a white one, a equal developments, though a dissimilar colour, driven inna one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull an torpid inna him intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, wid dat pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to him tribe; a tribe, weh eva enjoy all holidays an festivities wid finer, freeer relish dan any ada race. Fi blacks, di year's calendar shuda show naught but three hundred an sixty-five Fourth a Julys an New Year's Days. Nor smile so, while mi write seh dis likkle black was brilliant, for even blackness have its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony, paneled in king's cabinets. But Pip did love life, an all life's peaceable securities; so dat di panic-striking business in which him did somehow unaccountably become entrap, did most sadly blur him brightness; though, as ere long wi seen, weh did so temporarily subdued inna him, inna di end did destined fi be luridly illuminated by strange wild fires, weh fictitiously show him off to ten times di natural luster wid which inna him native Tolland County in Connecticut, him did once enlivened plenty a fiddler's pan di greenfrolic; an at melodious even-tide, wid him gay ha-ha! did turn di round horizon inna one star-belled tambourine. So, though inna di clear air a day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, di pure-watered diamond drop ago healthful glow; yet, wen di cunning jeweller woulda show yuh di diamond inna it most impressive lustre, him lay it against a gloomy ground, an den light it up, not by di sun, but by some unnatural gases. Den come out dem fiery effulgences, infernally superb; den di evil-blazing diamond, once di divinest symbol a di crystal skies, look like some crown-jewel weh dem tiif fram di King a Hell. But mek wi to di story.</p>
<p>It come to pass, dat inna di ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman chance so fi sprain him han, as fi a time fi become quite maimed; an, temporarily, Pip did put inna him place.</p>
<p>Di first time Stubb lower wid him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but happily, fi dat time, escape close contact wid di whale; an so it come off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb did a observe him, tek care, aftawards, fi exhort him fi cherish him courageousness to di utmost, fi him might often find it needful.</p>
<p>Now pan di secan lowering, di boat paddle pan di whale; an as di fish get di darted iron, it gi it customary rap, weh happen, inna dis instance, fi be right unda poor Pip's seat. Di involuntary consternation a di moment mek him leap, paddle inna han, outa di boat; an in such a way, dat deh part a di slack whale line weh did a come gens him chest, him breast it ovaboard wid him, so dat him did get entangled inna it, wen him at last plump inna di wata. Dat instant di stricken whale staat pan a fierce run, di line swiftly straighten; an presto! poor Pip come all foaming up to di chocks a di boat, remorselessly draged deh by di line, weh did tek several turns roun him chest an neck.</p>
<p>Tashtego did a stan op inna di bows. Im did full a di fire a di hunt. Him did hate Pip fi a poltroon. Snatching di boat-knife fram it sheath, him suspended it shaap edge ova di line, an turn towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip's blue, choked face plainly look, Do, fi God's sake! All pass inna a flash. Inna less dan half a minute, dis entire ting happen.</p>
<p>“Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; an so di whale did lost an Pip did get save.</p>
<p>So soon as him recover himself, di poor likkle negro did get assailed by yells an execrations fram di crew. Tranquilly permitting dem irregular cursings yah fi evaporate, Stubb den inna a plain, business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; an dat done, anofficially gi him nuff wholesome advice. Di substance was, Never jump fram a boat, Pip, except—but all di rest was indefinite, as di soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, <i>Stick to di boat</i> , a yuh true motto inna whaling; but cases will sometimes happen wen <i>Leap from di boat</i> , is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last dat if him shuda gi undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, him woulda be leaving him too wide a margin fi jump in fi di future; Stubb suddenly drop all advice, an conclude wid a peremptory command, “Stick to di boat, Pip, or by di Lord, mi naa go pick yuh up if yuh jump; mind dat. We can't afford fi lose whales by di likes a yuh; a whale woulda sell fi thirty times weh yuh woulda sell, Pip, inna Alabama Bear, an don't jump inna no more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, dat though man love him fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, weh propensity too often interfere wid him benevolence.</p>
<p>But wi all deh inna di han a di Gods; an Pip jomp agen. It did unda very similar circumstances to di first performance; but dis time him neva breast out di line; an hence, wen di whale staat run, Pip did lef bihain pan di sea, like a hurried traveller's trunk. Alas! Stubb did but true to him word. A did a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; di spangled sea calm an cool, an flatly stretching weh, all round, to di horizon, like gold-beater's skin hammered out to di extremest. Bobbing up an dung inna dat deh sea, Pip's ebon head did a show like a head a cloves. No boat-knife neva get lift wen him did a fall so rapidly astern. Stubb's inexorable back did turn pan him; an di whale did have wing. Inna three minutes, a whole mile a shoreless ocean did deh between Pip an Stubb. Out fram di center a di sea, poor Pip turn him crisp, curling, black head to di sun, anodda lonely castaway, though di loftiest an di brightest.</p>
<p>Now, inna calm weather, fi swim inna di open ocean is as easy to di practiced swimmer as fi ride inna a spring-carriage ashore. But di awful lonesomeness is intolerable. Di intense concentration a self inna di middle a such a heartless immensity, mi God! uu kyan tel it? Mark, how wen sailors inna a dead calm bathe inna di open sea—mark how closely dem hug dem ship an only coast along har sides.</p>
<p>But Stubb did really abandon di poor likkle negro to him fate? No; him neva mean fi, at least. Bikaaz a did two boat inna him wake, an him did suppose, no doubt, seh dem woulda come up to Pip very quickly, an pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeoparded through dem own timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; an such instances not unfrequently occur; almost invariably inna di fishery, a coward, so called, is marked wid di same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies an armies.</p>
<p>But it so happen, dat dem boat deh, widout seeing Pip, suddenly spy whales close to dem pan one side, turn, an gi chase; an Stubb's boat did deh so far weh, an him an all him crew so intent pan him fish, dat Pip's ringed horizon staat expand roun him miserably. By di merest chance di ship itself at last rescue him; but fram dat deh hour di likkle negro go bout di deck an idiot; such, at least, dem seh him was. Di sea did jeeringly kip him finite body up, but drown di infinite a him soul. Not drown entirely, though. Radda carry dung alive to wondrous depths, weh strange shapes a di unwarped primal world glide to an fro before him passive eyes; an di miser-merman, Wisdom, did reveal him hoarded heaps; an mongx di joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip si di multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, weh outa di firmament a waata did a heave di colossal orbs. Im si God foot pan di treadle a di loom, an im seh it; an so him shipmates dem call him mad. So man's insanity is heaven's sense; an wandering fram all mortal reason, man come at last to dat deh celestial thought, weh, fi reason, is absurd an frantic; an weal or woe, feel den uncompromised, indifferent as him God.</p>
<p>Fi di res, no blame Stubb too hardly. Di ting is common inna dat deh fishery; an inna di sequel a di narrative, it ago den be seen weh like abandonment befel miself.</p>
