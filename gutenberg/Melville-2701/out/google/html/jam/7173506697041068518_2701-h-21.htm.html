<h2 id="pgepubid00113">CHAPTER 107. Di Carpenter.</h2>
<p>Seat yuhself sultanically mongst di moons a Saturn, an tek high abstract man alone; an him look like a wonder, a grandeur, an a woe. But fram di same point, tek mankind inna mass, an fi di most part, dem seem a mob a unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary an hereditary. But most humble though him was, an far fram furnishing an example a di high, humane abstraction; di Pequod's carpenter neva duplicate; hence, him now come in person pan dis stage.</p>
<p>Like all sea-going ship carpenters, an more especially dem weh belong to whaling vessels, him was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent, alike experienced inna numerous trades an calings collateral to him own; di carpenter's pursuit being di ancient an outbranching trunk a all dem numerous handicrafts weh more or less have fi duh wid wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides di application to him a di generic remark above, dis carpenter a di Pequod was singularly efficient inna dem thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring inna a big ship, pan a three or four years' voyage, inna uncivilized an far-distant seas. Fi not fi taak bout him readiness inna ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming di shape a clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull's eyes inna di deck, or new tree-nails inna di side planks, an other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to him special business; him was moreover unhesitatingly expert inna all manner a conflicting aptitudes, both useful an capricious.</p>
<p>Di one grand stage weh him enact all him various parts so manifold, was him vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished wid several vices, a different sizes, an both a iron an a wood. At all times except wen whales did deh alongside, dis bench did securely lashed athwartships against di rear a di Try-works.</p>
<p>A belaying pin is find too big fi be easily insert inna it hole: di carpenter clap it inna one a him ever-ready vices, an straightway file it smaller. A lost land-bird wid strange plumage stray pan board, an get mek a captive: outa clean shaved rods a right-whale bone, an cross-beams a sperm whale ivory, di carpenter mek a pagoda-looking cage fi it. An oarsman sprain him wrist: di carpenter concoct a soothing lotion. Stubb did a long fi vermillion stars fi be paint pan di blade a him every oar; screwing each oar inna him big vice a wood, di carpenter symmetrically supply di constellation. A sailor tek a fancy fi wear shark-bone ear-rings: di carpenter drill him ears. Wan neks one have di toothache: di carpenter out pincers, an clapping one han pan him bench bid him fi sidong deh; but di poor fellow unmanageably winces unda di unconcluded operation; whirling round di handle a him wooden vice, di carpenter sign him fi clap him jaw inna dat, if him woulda mek him draw di tooth.</p>
<p>So, dis carpenter did prepare at all points, an alike indifferent an widout respect in all. Teet him account bits a ivory; heads weh him did tink but top-blocks; man demself him lightly hold fi capstan. But while now pan so wide a field so variously accomplished an wid such liveliness a expertness inna him, too; all dis woulda seem fi argue some uncommon vivacity a intelligence. But not precisely so. For notn was dis man more remarkable, dan fi a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, mi seh; fi it so shade off inna di surrounding infinite a tings, dat it did look one wid di general stolidity discernible inna di whole visible world; weh while pauselessly active inna uncounted modes, still eternally hold it peace, an ignore yuh, though yuh dig foundations fi cathedrals. Yet was dis half-horrible stolidity inna him, involving, too, as it appear, an all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, wid an old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and den wid a certain grizzled wittiness; such as mighta did serve fi pass di time during di midnight watch pan di bearded forecastle a Noah's ark. A did dat dis uol carpenter did a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to an fro, not only did gather no moss; but weh more, did rub off whatever small outward clingings mighta did originally pertain to him? Im was a stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born baby; living widout premeditated reference to dis world or di next. Yuh might almost seh, dat dis strange uncompromisedness inna him did involve a sort a unintelligence; fi inna him numerous trades, him neva did a work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because him did get tutor to it, or by any intermixture a all dem deh, even or uneven; but merely by a kind a deaf an dumb, spontaneous literal process. Im was a pure manipulator; him brain, if him did eva have one, mosi did early oozed along inna di muscles a him fingers. Im did like one a dem unreasoning but still highly useful, <i>multum in parvo</i> , Sheffield contrivances, assuming di exterior—though a likkle swelled—of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if him superiors did waan use di carpenter fi a screw-driver, all dem did haffi do was fi open dat deh part a him, an di screw did fast: or if fi tweezers, tek him up by di legs, an deh dem did deh.</p>
<p>Yet, as previously hinted, dis omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was, afta all, no mere machine of an automaton. If him neva have a common soul inna him, him did have a subtle someting weh somehow anomalously did a do it duty. Weh dat was, weda essence a quicksilver, or a few drops a hartshorn, yuh can telling. But deh it did deh; an deh it did deh fi now bout sixty years or more. An dis it was, dis same unaccountable, cunning life-principle inna him; dis it was, dat keep him a great part a di time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, weh also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, him body was a sentry-box an dis soliloquizer on guard deh, an a talk all di time fi keep himself awake.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00115">Di Deck—First Night Watch.</h3>
<p>( <i>Carpenter stan up before him vice-bench, an by di light a two lanterns busily a file di ivory joist fi di leg, which joist is firmly fixed inna di vice. Slabs a ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, an various tools a all sorts lie bout di bench. Forward, di red flame a di black flame, is at di seventh work.</i></p>
<p>Drat di file, an drat di bone! Dat a hard weh shuda be soft, an dat a soft weh shuda be hard. So wi go, who file old jaws an shinbones. Mek wi try anodda one. Aye, now, dis work beta ( <i>sneezes</i> ). Halloa, dis bone dust is ( <i>sneezes</i> )—why it's ( <i>sneezes</i> )—yes it's ( <i>sneezes</i> )—bless mi soul, it naa go mek mi speak! Dis a weh one old fellow get now fi work inna dead lumber. Si a live tree, an yuh nuh get dis dust; amputate a live bone, an yuh nuh get it ( <i>sneezes</i> ). Come, come, yuh old Smut, deh, bear a han, an mek wi have dat deh ferule an buckle-screw; Mi ago ready fi dem presently. Lucky now ( <i>sneezes</i> ) no knee-joint fi mek; dat might puzzle a likkle; but a mere shinbone—why it easy as mek hop-poles; only mi shuda like fi put a good finish on. Time, time; if mi but only did have di time, mi coulda turn him out as neat a leg now as ever ( <i>sneezes</i> ) scraped to a lady in a parlor. Dem deh buckskin legs an calves a legs weh mi see inna shop windows wouldn't compare at all. Dem soak water, dem do; an of course get rheumatic, an haffi be doctored ( <i>sneezes</i> ) wid washes an lotions, jus like live legs. Deh suh; bifuo mi si it aaf, nou, mi afi kaal im uol Mogulship, an si ef di lent ago rait; too short, if anyting, mi guess. Ha! dat a di heel; wi deh inna luck; yah him come, or a somebody else, dat certain.</p>
<p>AHAB ( <i>advancing</i> ). ( <i>Durin di ensuing scene, di carpenter continue sneezing at times.</i> )</p>
<p>Well, manmaker!</p>
<p>Jus in time, sir. If di captain please, mi ago mark di length now. Mek mi measure, sa.</p>
<p>Measured fi a leg! gud. Well, a nuh di first time. A bout it! Deh suh; kip yuh finga pan it. Dis a one cogent vice yuh have yah, carpenter; mek mi feel it grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.</p>
<p>Oh, sa, it ago break bones—beware, beware!</p>
<p>No fried; Mi like a good grip; Mi like fi feel someting inna dis slippery world weh can hold, man. Weh Prometheus bout deh?—di blacksmith, mi mean—weh him bout?</p>
<p>Him mosi a forge di buckle-screw, sa, now.</p>
<p>Rite. A one partnership; him supply di muscle part. Him mek a fierce red flame deh!</p>
<p>Aye, sir; him mus have di white heat fi dis kind a fine work.</p>
<p>Um-m. So him haffi. Mi do deem it now a most meaning ting, dat dat deh ole Greek, Prometheus, weh mek man, dem seh, shuda did a blacksmith, an animate dem wid fire; fi weh mek inna fire haffi belong to fire; an so hell's probable. How di soot fly! Dis mus be di remainder di Greek mek di Africans a. Carpenter, wen him don wid dat deh buckle, tell him fi forge a pair a steel shoulder-blades; a pedlar deh pan di board wid a crushing pack.</p>
<p>Sar?</p>
<p>Hol; while Prometheus deh bout it, mi ago order a complete man afta a desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high inna him socks; den, chest modeled afta di Thames Tunnel; den, legs wid roots to 'em, fi stay inna one place; den, arms three feet thru di wrist; no heart at all, brass forehead, an bout a quarter a an acre a fine brains; an mek mi see—mi fi order eyes fi see outwards? No, but put a sky-light pan top a him head fi illuminate inwards. Deh, tek di order, an weh.</p>
<p>Nou, wa im a taak bout, an a uu im a taak tu, mi shuda laik fi nuo? Mi fi keep stan up yah? ( <i>aside</i> ).</p>
<p>'A but indifferent architecture fi mek a blind dome; dis a one. No, no, no; Mi haffi have a lantern.</p>
<p>Ho, ho! Dat a it, hey? Yahso a two, sa; one ago serve mi turn.</p>
<p>Weh yuh a thrust dat deh tief-catcher inna mi face fi, man? Thrusted light is worse dan presented pistols.</p>
<p>Mi did tink, sa, seh yuh did a taak to carpenter.</p>
<p>Boad man? why dat—but no;—a very tidy, an, mi may seh, a extremely gentlemanlike sort a business yuh deh inna yah, carpenter;—or yuh woulda radda work inna clay?</p>
<p>Sir?—Clay? clay, sir? Dat a mud; wi lef clay to ditchers, sir.</p>
<p>Di fellow's impious! Weh yuh a sneeze bout?</p>
<p>Bone is rather dusty, sir.</p>
<p>Tek di hint, den; an wen yuh ded, neva bury yuhself unda living people nose.</p>
<p>Sir?—oh! ah!—Mi guess so;—yes—oh, dear!</p>
<p>Look yuh, carpenter, mi dare seh yuh call yuhself a right good workmanlike workman, eh? Well, den, it ago taak gud fi yuh work, if, wen mi come fi mount dis leg weh yuh mek, mi ago nevertheless feel anodda leg inna di same identical place wid it; dat mean, carpenter, mi ole lost leg; di flesh an blood one, mi mean. Yuh cyaan run weh dat deh ole Adam?</p>
<p>Fi chruu, sa, mi staat fi andastan likl nou. Yes, mi hear someting curious pan dat deh score, sir; how dat a dismasted man neva entirely lose di feeling a him old spar, but it will still be pricking him at times. Mi can humbly ask if it really so, sir?</p>
<p>A dat, man. Look, put yuh live leg yah inna di place weh mi one did deh; so, now, yahso a only one distinct leg to di eye, yet two to di soul. Weh yuh feel tingling life; deh, exactly deh, deh to a hair, do I. A nuh riddle?</p>
<p>Mi shuda humbly call it a poser, sir.</p>
<p>Hist, den. How yuh know seh some entire, living, thinking ting may not be invisibly an uninterpenetratingly standing precisely weh yuh stand now; aye, an stan op deh inna yuh spite? Inna yuh most solitary hours, den, yuh no fear eavesdroppers? Uol, no taak! An if mi still feel di smart a mi crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; den, why yuh, carpenter, cyaan feel di fiery pains a hell fi eva, an widout a body? Hah!</p>
<p>Gud Laad! Truly, sir, if it come to dat, mi haffi calculate ova again; Mi tingk se mi neva kyari no likl figa, sa.</p>
<p>Look ye, pudding-heads shudn't never grant premises.—How long before di leg is done?</p>
<p>Miebi wan owa, sa.</p>
<p>Bungle away at it den, an bring it to mi ( <i>turns to go</i> ). Oh, Life! Yahso mi deh, proud as Greek god, an yet standing debtor to dis blockhead fi a bone fi stan pan! Cursed be dat mortal inter-indebtedness weh naa go do weh wid ledgers. Mi woulda be free as air; an mi dong iina di uol worl buk dem. Mi so rich, mi coulda did gi bid fi bid wid di wealthiest Prætorians dem at di auction a di Roman empire (we was di world's); an yet mi owe fi di flesh inna di tongue weh mi brag wid. By heavens! Mi ago get a crucible, an into it, an dissolve miself dung to one likkle, compendious vertebra. Suh.</p>
<p>CARPENTER ( <i>resume him work</i> ).</p>
<p>Well, well, well! Stubb know him bes a all, an Stubb always seh him queer; seh nutten but dat one sufficient likkle word queer; him queer, seh Stubb; him queer—queer, queer; an keep dinning it inna Mr. Starbuck all di time—queer—sir—queer, queer, very queer. An yahso him leg deh! Yes, now dat mi tink bout it, yahso him bedfellow deh! have a stick a whale's jaw-bone fi a wife! An dis a him leg; him ago stan pan dis. Weh dat was now bout one leg stan up inna three places, an all three places stan up inna one hell—how was dat? Awo! Mi nuh wanda him did look so scornful at mi! Mi a one sortn strange-thoughted sometimes, dem seh; but dat a only haphazard-like. Den, a short, likkle ole body like mi, shudn't eva undertake fi wade out inna deep waters wid tall, heron-built captains; di wata chuck yuh unda di chin pretty quick, an deh deh a great cry fi life-boats. An dis a di heron leg! lang an slim, sure enough! Now, fi most folks one pair a legs last a lifetime, an dat mus be because dem use dem mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady use har roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh him a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to death, an spavined di other fi life, an now wears out bone legs by di cord. Halloa, deh, yuh Smut! bear a han deh wid dem screws deh, an mek wi finish it before di resurrection fellow come a-calling wid him horn fi all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, fi fill 'em up again. Weh a leg dis is! It look like a real live leg, file dung to nutten but di core; him ago stan op pan dis to-morrow; him ago be tek altitudes pan it. Halloa! Mi almost forget di likkle oval slate, smoothed ivory, weh him figure up di latitude. So, so; chisel, file, an sand-paper, now!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00116">CHAPTER 109. Ahab an Starbuck inna di Cabin.</h2>
<p>According to usage dem did a pump di ship next morning; an lo! no inconsiderable oil neva come up wid di wata; di casks dem dung deh mosi did sprung a bad leak. Much concern did show; an Starbuck go dung inna di cabin fi report dis unfavorable affair.*</p>
<p>*Inna Sperm-whalemen wid any considerable quantity a oil pan board, it is a regular semi-weekly duty fi conduct a hose inna di hold, an drench di casks wid sea-water; weh aftawards, at varying intervals, get tek weh by di ship's pumps. Hereby di casks dem a try fi be kept damply tight; while by di changed character a di withdrawn water, di mariners readily detect any serious leakage inna di precious cargo.</p>
<p>Now, fram di South an West di Pequod did a draw nigh to Formosa an di Bashee Isles, between weh deh one a di tropical outlets fram di China waters inna di Pacific. An so Starbuck find Ahab wid a general chart a di oriental archipelagoes weh did spread before him; an anodda separate one weh represent di long eastern coast a di Japanese islands—Niphon, Matsmai, an Sikoke. Wid him snow-white new ivory leg brace against di screwed leg a him table, an wid a long pruning-hook a jack-knife inna him han, di wondrous old man, wid him back to di gangway door, did a wrinkl him brow, an a trace him old courses again.</p>
<p>“A who deh deh?” hear di footstep at di door, but not turning round to it. “On deck! Begone!”</p>
<p>“Captain Ahab mistakes; a mi. Di oil inna di hold a leak, sir. Wi haffi up Burtons an break out.”</p>
<p>“Up Burtons an break out? Now dat wi deh near Japan; heave-to yah fi a week fi tinker a parcel a old hoops?”</p>
<p>“Either do dat, sa, or waste inna one day more oil dan we may mek good inna a year. Weh we come twenty thousand miles fi get is worth saving, sir.”</p>
<p>“So it go, so it go; if wi get it.”</p>
<p>“Mi did a taak bout di oil inna di hold, sa.”</p>
<p>“An mi neva did a taak or tink bout dat at all. Begone! Mek it leak! Mi all aleak miself. Aye! leaks inna leaks! not only full a leaky casks, but dem leaky casks deh inna a leaky ship; an dat a far worse plight dan di Pequod's, man. Yet mi nuh stop fi plug mi leak fi find it deep inna di hull; or how hope fi plug it, even if find, inna dis life's howling gale mi naa go have di Burtons hoisted.”</p>
<p>“Weh di owna dem ago seh, sa?”</p>
<p>“Mek di owna dem stan op pan Nantucket beach an outyell di Typhoons. Weh Ahab care? Owners, owners? Yuh always a prate to mi, Starbuck, bout dem miserly owners, as if di owners dem a mi conscience. But look yuh, di only real owna a anyting a it commander; an hark yuh, mi conscience deh inna dis deck ship 'keel!”</p>
<p>“Captain Ahab,” seh di reddening mate, moving further inna di cabin, wid a daring so strangely respectful an cautious dat it almost did look like not only every way seeking fi avoid di slightest outward manifestation a itself, but widin also did look more dan half distrustful a itself; “A beta man dan mi might well pass ova inna yuh weh him woulda quickly enough resent inna a younger man; aye, an inna a happier, Captain Ahab.”</p>
<p>“Devils! Yuh den so much as dare fi critically tink bout mi?—On deck!”</p>
<p>“Nay, sa, not yet; mi a beg. An mi a dare, sa—fi be forbearing! Wi shudn't understand each other better dan hitherto, Captain Ahab?”</p>
<p>Ahab tek a loaded musket fram di rack (we did a form part a most South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), an point it towards Starbuck, exclaimed: “A one God deh weh a Lord ova di earth, an one Captain weh a lord ova di Pequod.—On deck!”</p>
<p>Fi a instant inna di flashing eyes a di mate, an him fiery cheeks, yuh woulda almost tink seh him did really get di blaze a di leveled tube. But, mastering him emotion, him half calmly rose, an as him quit di cabin, pause fi a instant an seh: “Yuh did outraged, nuh insult mi, sir; but fi dat mi a ask yuh fi nuh beware a Starbuck; yuh woulda jus laugh; but mek Ahab beware a Ahab; beware a yuhself, old man.”</p>
<p>“Im wax brave, but nevertheless obey; most careful bravery dat!” murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappear. “A wa dat im se—Ehab wach out fi Ehab—sopm de de!” Den unconsciously using di musket fi a staff, wid a iron brow him pace to an fro inna di likkle cabin; but presently di thick plaits a him forehead relax, an returning di gun to di rack, him go to di deck.</p>
<p>“Yuh a but too good a fellow, Starbuck,” him seh lowly to di mate; den raising him voice to di crew: “Furl di t'gallant-sails, an close-reef di top-sails, fore an aft; back di main-yard; up Burton, an break out inna di main-hold.”</p>
<p>It was perhaps vain fi surmise exactly why it was, dat as respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus act. It maita did a flash a honesty inna him; or mere prudential policy weh, anda di circumstance, imperiously forbade di slightest symptom a open disaffection, however transient, inna di important chief officer a him ship. However it was, him orders dem did execute; an di Burtons dem did a hoist.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00117">CHAPTER 110. Queequeg inna Him Coffin.</h2>
<p>Wen dem did a look, dem find out seh di casks dem weh dem did last strike inna di hold did perfectly sound, an dat di leak mus be further off. So, it being calm weather, dem break out deeper an deeper, disturbing di slumbers a di huge ground-tier butts; an fram dat deh black midnight sending dem gigantic moles inna di daylight above. So deep dem did go; an so ancient, an corroded, an weedy di aspect a di lowermost puncheons, dat yuh almost look next fi some moldy corner-stone cask weh did have coins a Captain Noah, wid copies a di posted placards, vainly warning di infatuated old world fram di flood. Tierce afta tierce, too, a water, an bread, an beef, an shooks a staves, an iron bundles a hoops, did a hoist out, til at last di piled decks dem did aad fi get bout; an di hollow hull did a echo unda foot, as if yuh did a tread ova empty catacombs, an did a reel an roll inna di sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was di ship as a dinnerless student wid all Aristotle inna him head. Well was it dat di Typhoons dem neva visit dem den.</p>
<p>Now, at dis time it was dat mi poor pagan companion, an fast bosom-friend, Queequeg, did get seize wid a fever, weh bring him nier to him endless end.</p>
<p>Be it said, dat inna dis vocation a whaling, sinecures are unknown; dignity an danger go han in han; til yuh get fi be Captain, di higher yuh rise di harder yuh toil. So wid poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer, mus not only face all di rage a di living whale, but—as we have elsewhere seen—mount him dead back inna a rolling sea; an finally descend inna di gloom a di hold, an bitterly sweating all day inna dat deh subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle di clumsiest casks an see to dem stowage. Fi be short, mongst whalemen, di harpooneers dem a di holders, so called.</p>
<p>Poor Queequeg! wen di ship did bout half disembowelled, yuh shuda did stoop ova di hatchway, an peer dung pan him deh; weh, stripped to him woolen drawers, di tattooed savage did a crawl bout mid dat deh dampness an slime, like a green spotted lizard at di bottom a one well. An a well, or an ice-house, it somehow prove to him, poor pagan; weh, strange fi seh, fi all di heat a him sweatings, him ketch a terrible chill weh laps inna a fever; an at last, afta some days' suffering, put him inna him hammock, close to di very sill a di door a death. How him waste an waste weh inna dem deh few long-lingering days, til it did look like likkle bit lef a him but him frame an tattooing. But as all else inna him did a thin, an him cheek-bones did a grow sharper, him eyes, nevertheless, did a look fuller an fuller; dem ton a strange softness a lustre; an mildly but deeply look out pan yuh deh fram him sickness, a wonderous testimony to dat immortal health inna him weh couldn't dead, or be weakned. An like circles pan di wata, weh, as dem grow fainter, expand; so him eyes dem did a look roun an roun, like di rings a Eternity. An awe weh yuh can't name woulda steal ova yuh as yuh did a sidong by di side a dis waning savage, an si as strange tings inna him face, as any beheld who did deh bystanders wen Zoroaster dead. Kaaz eniting we riili wandaful an fried ina man, neva yet put iina wod ar buk. An di drawing near a Death, weh alike levels all, alike impress all wid a last revelation, weh only an author fram di dead coulda adequately tell. So dat—mek wi se it agen—no dying Chaldee or Greek neva have higher an holier thoughts dan dem deh, whose mysterious shades yuh did si creeping ova di face a poor Queequeg, as him quietly lay inna him swaying hammock, an di rolling sea did a look like him did a rock him to him final rest, an di ocean's invisible flood lift him higher an lide higher toward him higher destined heaven.</p>
<p>No man a di crew but gi him up; an, as fi Queequeg himself, weh him did tink bout him case did forcibly shown by a curious favor weh him did ask. Im call one to him inna di grey morning watch, wen di day did a jus break, an tek im han, an seh dat while inna Nantucket im did have chance fi si certain likkle canoes a dark wood, like di rich war-wood a im native isle; an wen him did ask, him did laan seh all whalemen weh did ded inna Nantucket, did deh inna dem same dark canoes, an dat di fancy fi be so laid did mek him pleas; fi it neva unlike di custom a him own race, who, afta him embalm a dead warrior, stretch him out inna him canoe, an so lef him fi be float weh to di starry archipelagoes; fi not only dem believe seh di stars dem a isles, but dat far beyond all visible horizons, dem own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow wid di blue heavens; an so form di white breakers a di milky way. Im added, seh im shiek wen im tink bout dem beri im inna im hammock, according to di usual sea-custom, tossed like someting vile to di death-devouring sharks. No: him did waan a canoe like dem a Nantucket, all di more congenial to him, being a whaleman, dat like a whale-boat dem coffin-canoes deh did deh widout a keel; though dat did involve but uncertain steering, an much lee-way adown di dim ages.</p>
<p>Now, wen dis strange circumstance did mek known aft, di carpenter did at once command fi do Queequeg's bidding, whatever it might include. Deh did have some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber abord, weh, pan a long previous voyage, did get cut fram di aboriginal groves a di Lackaday islands, an fram dem dark planks deh did recommend fi mek di coffin. No sooner di carpenter did apprised a di order, dan tek him rule, him forthwith wid all di indifferent promptitude a him character, proceed inna di forecastle an tek Queequeg's measure wid great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg's person as him shift di rule.</p>
<p>“Ah! poor fellow! him a go haffi die now,” di Long Island sailor ejaculated.</p>
<p>Going to him vice-bench, di carpenter fi convenience sake an general reference, now transferringly measure pan it di exact length di coffin was fi be, an den mek di transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities. Dis done, him marshal di planks an him tools, an to work.</p>
<p>Wen di laas nail did drive, an di lid did duly plan an fit, him lightly shoulder di coffin an go forward wid it, an inquiring if dem did ready fi it yet inna dat deh direction.</p>
<p>Wen dem ier di indignant but half-humorous cries wid weh di people dem pan deck staat drive di coffin weh, Queequeg, to every one's consternation, command seh di ting shuda instantly bring to him, nor was anybody denying him; seeing dat, a all mortals, some dying man dem a di most tyrannical; an certainly, since dem ago trouble wi so likkle fi eva, di poor fellows dem fi be indulged.</p>
<p>Leaning ova inna him hammock, Queequeg long regarded di coffin wid an attentive eye. Den him call fi him harpoon, mek dem tek di wooden stock fram it, an den mek dem put di iron part inna di coffin wid one a di paddles a him boat. All by him own request, also, biscuits dem did den range roun di sides widin: a flask a fresh water did put at di head, an a likkle bag a woody earth did scrape up inna di hold at di foot; an a piece a sail-cloth weh dem did a roll up fi a pillow, Queequeg now did a beg fi be lift up inna him final bed, dat him coulda mek trial a it comforts, if any it did have. Im lie dong widout move fi a few minutes, den tell one fi go a im bag an bring out im likkle god, Yojo. Den crossing him arms pan him breast wid Yojo between, him call fi di coffin lid (hatch him call it) fi be place ova him. Di head part turn ova wid a leather hinge, an deh deh Queequeg did deh inna him coffin wid likkle but him composed countenance inna view. “Rarmai” (it ago do; it easy), him murmured at last, an sign fi get replace inna him hammock.</p>
<p>But before dis did done, Pip, who did a slily hover near by all dis while, draw nier to him weh him did a lay, an wid soft sobbings, tek him by di han; inna di ada one, a hold him tambourine.</p>
<p>“Poor rover! yuh neva don wid all dis weary roving? weh yuh a go now? But if di currents carry yuh to dem sweet Antilles weh di beach dem only beat wid water-lilies, yuh wi do one likkle errand fi mi? Seek out one Pip, who's now been miss long: Mi tink him deh inna dem far Antilles. him lef him tambourine behind;—Mi find it Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die an mi ago beat ye yuh dying march.”</p>
<p>“Mi hear,” Starbuck murmured dung di scuttle, “seh inna violent fevers, man, all ignorance, did a talk inna ancient tongues; an dat wen di mystery get probe, it turn out always seh inna dem wholly forgotten childhood dem ancient tongues deh did really taak inna dem hearing by some lofty scholars, So fond, so, fi poor, inna dis poor, poor. sweetness a him lunacy, bring heavenly vouchers a all wi heavenly homes. Weh him laan dat, but deh?—Hark!</p>
<p>“Form two an two! Mek wi mek a General a him! Ho, weh him harpoon deh? Lay it across yah.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh fi a game cock now fi sit upon him head an crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye dat; Queequeg dies game!—take ye good heed of dat deh; base likkle Pip, him did ded all a'shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; all cowards—shame upon dem! Mek dem go drown like Pip, weh jump fram a whale-boat Shame!</p>
<p>Durin all dis, Queequeg did a lay wid closed eyes, as if inna a dream. Pip did get lead weh, an di sick man did get replace inna him hammock.</p>
<p>But now dat him did apparently mek every preparation fi death; now dat him coffin did prove a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rally; soon it did look like no need fi di carpenter's box: an den, wen some a dem did a express dem delighted surprise, him, inna substance, seh, dat di cause a him sudden convalescence was dis;—at a critical moment, him did jus memba a likkle duty ashore, weh him did a lef undone; an so him did change him mind bout dying: him couldn't die yet, him averred. Dem ask him, den, weda fi live or die was a matter a him own sovereign will an pleasure. Im ansa, fi shuor. In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, dat if a man mek up him mind fi live, mere sickness couldn't kill him: notn but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of dat deh sort.</p>
<p>Now, deh have dis noteworthy difference between savage an civilized; dat while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again inna a day. So, inna good time mi Queequeg get strength; an at length afta him did sidong pan di windlass fi a few indolent days (but did a eat wid a vigorous appetite) him suddenly leap op pan him foot dem, throw out him arms an legs, gi himself a good stretching, yawn a likkle bit, an den spring inna di head a him hoisted boat, an poising a harpoon, proced himself fi fight.</p>
<p>Wid a wild whimsiness, him now use him coffin fi a sea-chest; an empty inna it him canvas bag a clothes, set dem inna order deh. Plenty spare hours him spen, a carving di lid wid all manner a grotesque figures an drawings; an it did look like seh him did a try, inna him rude way, fi copy parts a di twisted tattooing pan him body. An dis tattooing did a di work a one departed prophet an seer a him island, who, by dem hieroglyphic marks deh, did write out pan him body a complete theory a di heavens an di earth, an a mystical treatise pan di art a attaining truth; so dat Queequeg inna him own proper person was a riddle fi unfold; a wandaful work inna one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself coulda read, though him own live heart beat against dem; an dem mysteries deh did so destined inna di end fi moulder weh wid di living parchment weh dem did inscribe pan, an so be unsolved to di last. An dis thought it mus been weh did suggest to Ahab dat wild exclamation a him, wen one morning turn weh fram surveying poor Queequeg—“Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00118">CHAPTER 111. Di Pacific.</h2>
<p>Wen wi did a glide by di Bashee isles wi did come at last pan di great South Sea; if it neva fi ada tings, mi coulda did greet mi dear Pacific wid uncounted tanks, fi now di long supplication a mi youth did ansa; dat deh serene ocean roll eastwards fram mi a thousand leagues a blue.</p>
<p>Deh deh, yuh no know weh sweet mystery bout dis sea, weh gently awful stirrings seem fi speak bout some hidden soul beath; like dem fabled undulations a di Ephesian sod ova di buried Evangelist St. John. An meet it is, dat ova dem sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies an Potters' Fields a all four continents, di waves shuda rise an fall, an ebb an flow unceasingly; fi yah, millions a mixed shades an shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all weh wi call lives an souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers inna dem bed; di ever-rolling waves but mek so by dem restlessness.</p>
<p>To any meditative Magian rover, dis serene Pacific, once beheld, must ever after be di sea of ​​him adoption. It roll di midmost waters a di worl, di Indian ocean an Atlantic being but its arms. Di same waves wash di moles a di new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted by di recentest race a man, an lave di faded but still gorgeous skirts a Asiatic lans, older dan Abraham; wile all between float milky-ways of coral isles, an low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, an impenetrable Japans. So dis mysterious, divine Pacific zones di world's whole bulk bout; mek all coasts one bay to it; look like di tide-beating heart a earth. Lifted by dem eternal swells, yuh need fi own di seductive god, bowing yuh head to Pan.</p>
<p>But few thoughts a Pan stir Ahab's brain, as standing like an iron statue at him accustomed place beside di mizen rigging, wid one nostril him unthinkingly snuff di sugary musk fram di Bashee isles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers mus be walking), an wid di other consciously inna di salthal breath weh him find di new sea; dat deh sea in which di hated White Whale mus even den be swimming. Launched at length upon dem almost final waters, an gliding towards di Japanese cruising-ground, di old man's purpose intensified itself. Him firm lips dem meet like di lips a one vice; di Delta a him forehead's veins swell like overladen brooks; inna him very sleep, him ringing cry run through di vaulted hull, “Stern all! di White Whale spout thick blood!”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00119">CHAPTER 112. Di Blacksmith.</h2>
<p>Availing himself a di mild, summer-cool weather weh now reign inna dem latitudes yah, an inna preparation fi di peculiarly active pursuits dem weh did a go be anticipated, Perth, di begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, neva tek weh him portable forge to di hold again, afta him did conclude him contributory work fi Ahab's legs, but fast pan it, fast pan it lashed to ringbolts by di foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked by di headsmen, an harpooneers, an bowsmen fi do some likkle job fi dem; altering, or repairing, or new shaping dem various weapons an boat furniture. Often him woulda be surrounded by a eager circle, all waiting fi be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, an lances, an jealously watching him every sooty movement, as him toiled. Nevertheless, dis old man's was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come fram him. Silent, slow, an solemn; bowing ova still further him chronically broken back, him toiled weh, as if toil was life itself, an di heavy beating a him hammer di heavy beating a him heart. An so it was.—Most miserable!</p>
<p>A peculiar walk inna dis old man, a certain slight but painful appearing yawing inna him gait, did at an early period a di voyage excited di curiosity a di mariners. An to di importunity a dem persisted questionings him did finally give in; an so it come to pass dat every one now know di shameful story a him wretched fate.</p>
<p>Belated, an not innocently, one bitter winta's midnight, pan di road running between two country towns, di blacksmith half-stupidly feel di deadly numbness stealing ova him, an search refuge inna a leaning, dilapidated barn. Di issue was, di loss a di extremities a both feet. Out a dis revelation, part by part, at last come out di four acts a di gladness, an di one long, an as yet uncatastrophied fifth act a di grief a him life's drama.</p>
<p>Im a did one old man, who, at di age a nearly sixty, did postponedly encounter dat deh ting inna sorrow's technicals weh dem call ruin. Im did a one artisan a famed excellence, an wid plenty fi do; own a house an garden; embrace a youthful, daughta-like, loving wife, an three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday go a one cheerful-looking church, weh dem did plant inna a grove. But one night, unda cover a darkness, an further concealed inna a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid inna him happy yaad, an rob dem all a everyting. An darker yet fi tell, di blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct dis burglar inna him family heart. A did di Bottle Conjuror! Wen di fatal cork opening, di fiend fly out, an shrivel up him yaad. Now, fi prudent, most wise, an economic reasons, di blacksmith's shop did deh inna di basement a him dwelling, but wid a separate entrance to it; so dat always did di young an loving healthy wife did a lisn wid no unhappy nervousness, but wid vigorous pleasure, to di stout ringing a har young-armed old husband's hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing thru di floors an walls, come up to har, not unsweetly, inna har nursery; an so, fi stout Labor's iron lullaby, di blacksmith's infants dem did rock to slumber.</p>
<p>Oh, woe pan woe! Oh, Death, why yuh can't sometimes be timely? If yuh did tek dis ole blacksmith to yuhself ere him full ruin come pan him, den di young widow did have a delicious grief, an har orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire fi dream a inna dem afta years; an all a dem a care-killing competency. But Death pluck dung some virtuous elder bredda, pan whose whistling daily toil solely hung di responsibilities a some ada family, an lef di worse dan useless old man standing, til di hideous rot a life shuda mek him easier fi harvest.</p>
<p>Why fi tell di whole? Di blows a di basement hammer every day did a grow more an more between; an each blow every day did a grow fainter dan di last; di wife did sidong frozen a di window, wid tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing inna di weeping faces a har pickney dem; di bellows dem fall; di forge choke up wid cinders; di ous did sel; di mada diiv dong inna di lang church-yaad graas; har pickney dem did a follow har two time deh; an di houseless, familyless old man stagger off a vagabond inna crape; him every woe unreverenced; him grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!</p>
<p>Death look like di only desirable sequel fi a career like dis; but Death is only a launching inna di region a di strange Untried; it is only di first salution to di possibilities a di immense Remote, di Wild, di Watery, di Unshored; so, to di death-longing eyes a such man, who still have lef inna dem some interior compunctions against suicide, does di all-contributed an all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth him whole plain a unimaginable, taking terrors, an wonderful, new-life adventures; an fram di hearts a infinite Pacifics, di thousand mermaids dem sing to dem—“Come hither, broken-hearted; yahso a anodda life widout di guilt a intermediate death; yahso a wonders supernatural, widout dying fi dem. Come hither! bury yuhself inna a life weh, to yuh now equally abhorred an abhorred, abhorred land, come up hither, oblious more dan death! <i>yuh</i> gravestone, too, widin di churchyard, an come yah, til wi married yuh!”</p>
<p>Hearkening to dem voices yah, East an West, by early sunrise, an by fall of eve, di blacksmith's soul respond, Aye, mi come! An so Perth go a-whaling.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00120">CHAPTER 113. Di Forge.</h2>
<p>Wid matted beard, an swathed inna a bristling shark-skin apron, bout mid-day, Perth did a stan up between him forge an anvil, di latter place upon a iron-wood log, wid one han a hold a pike-head inna di coals, an wid di ada han a hold a pike-head inna di coals, an wid di ada han a hold a pike-head inna di coals, an wid di ada han a him forge lungs, wen Captain Ahab come along, a carry inna him han, a likkle leather-looking bag. While still a likkle distance fram di forge, moody Ahab paused; til at last, Perth, widdrawing him iron fram di fire, staat hammer it pan di anvil—di red mass did a sen off di sparks dem inna thick hovering flights, some a dem did a fly close to Ahab.</p>
<p>“A yuh Mother Carey's chickens yah, Perth? Dem always a fly inna yuh wake; birds a good omen, too, but not to all;—look yah, dem burn; but yuh—you liv mongst dem widout a scorch.”</p>
<p>“Bikaaz mi get scorc all ova, Captain Ahab,” Perth ansa, resting fi a moment pan him hammer; “Mi past scorching, yuh can't easily scorch a scar.”</p>
<p>“Well, well; no more. Yuh shrunk voice sound too calmly, sanely woeful to mi. Inna no Paradise miself, mi impatient a all misery inna others weh nuh mad. Yuh shudn't go mad, blacksmith; seh, why yuh nuh go mad? How can't yuh endure widout being mad Yuh hate di heens yet? yuh can't go mad?—Weh yuh did a mek deh?”</p>
<p>“Welding an ole pike-head, sir; it did have seams an dents inna it.”</p>
<p>“An yuh can't mek it all smooth again, blacksmith, afta such hard usage as it did?”</p>
<p>“Mi tink so, sa.”</p>
<p>“An mi tink yuh cyaan smooth almost any seams an dents, neva mind how hard di metal, blacksmith?”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir, mi tink mi can; all seams an dents but one.”</p>
<p>“Look yuh yah, den,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, an leaning wid both han dem pan Perth's shoulders; “look yuh yah— <i>yah</i> —yu can smoothe out a seam like dis, blacksmith,” sweeping one han across him ribbed brow; “if yuh couldn't, blacksmith, glad enough mi woulda lay mi head pan yuh anvil, an feel yuh heaviest hammer between mi eyes. Answer! Can't yuh smoothe dis seam?”</p>
<p>“Oh! dat a di one, sir! Mi seh not all seams an dents but one?”</p>
<p>“Aye, blacksmith, it a di one; aye, man, it no smoothable; cause though yuh only see it yah inna mi flesh, it work dung inna di bone a mi skull— <i>dat</i> is all wrinkles! But, away wid child's play; no more gaffs an pikes to-day. Look yuh yah!” jingling di leathern bag, as if it did full a gold coins. “Mi, too, waan a harpoon mek; one weh a thousand yoke a fiends couldn't part, Perth; someting weh wi stick inna a whale like him own fin-bone. Deh deh di stuff,” flinging di pouch pan di anvil. “Look yuh, blacksmith, dem a di gathered nail-stubbs a di steel shoes a racing horses.”</p>
<p>“Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, yuh have yah, den, di bes an stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths eva work.”</p>
<p>“Mi know it, ole man; dem stubbs yah ago weld tugeda like glue fram di melt bones a morderers. Quick! forge mi di harpoon. An forge mi fos, twelve rods fi it shank; den wind, an twist, an hammer dem twelve yah tugeda like di yarns an strands a tow-line. Quick!''ll blow di fire.”</p>
<p>Wen dem did mek di twelve rod dem, Ahab did a try dem, one by one, an did a spiral dem, wid him own han, roun a lang, hevy iron bolt. “A flaw!” reject di last one. “Work dat ova again, Perth.”</p>
<p>Dis done, Perth did bout fi staat weld di twelve inna one, wen Ahab stay him han, an seh him woulda weld him own iron. As, den, wid regular, gasping hems, him hammer pan di anvil, Perth pass to him di glowing rods, one afta di ada, an di hard pressed forge shoot up its intense straight flame, di Parsee pass silently, an bow ova him head towards di fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing pan di toil. But, as Ahab look up, him slip aside.</p>
<p>“Weh dat deh bunch a lucifers deh a dodge bout deh fi?” Stubb muttered, looking on fram di forecastle. “Dat Parsee smell fire like a fusee; an smell a it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan.”</p>
<p>At last di shank, inna one complete rod, get it final heat; an as Perth, fi temper it, plonge it all hissing inna di cask a water near by, di scalding steam shot up inna Ahab's bent face.</p>
<p>“Yuh woulda brand mi, Perth?” wincing fi a moment wid di pain; “mi did a but forge mi own branding-iron, den?”</p>
<p>“Pray God, not dat; yet mi fraid someting, Captain Ahab. A nuh dis harpoon fi di White Whale?”</p>
<p>"Fi di wait fiend! But now fi di barbs; yuh haffi mek dem yuhself, man. Yahso mi razors deh—di bes a steel; yahso, an mek di barbs dem shaap laik di needle-sleet a di Icy Sea."</p>
<p>Fi a moment, di ole blacksmith did a look pan di razors dem as if him woulda fain not use dem.</p>
<p>“Tek dem, man, mi no niid dem, kaaz mi naa shiev, mi naa nyam, ar prie til—bot kom ya—go wok!”</p>
<p>Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, an welded by Perth to di shank, di steel soon pointed di end a di iron; an as di blacksmith did bout fi gi di barbs dem final heat, before im did a temper dem, him did a cry to Ahab fi put di water-cask near.</p>
<p>“No, no—no water fi dat; mi waan it a di true death-temper. Ahoy, deh! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! Weh yuh seh, pagans! Yuh wi gi mi as much blood as will cover dis barb?” holding it high up. A cluster a dark nods ansa, Yes. Three punctures did mek inna di heathen flesh, an di White Whale's barbs dem did den temper.</p>
<p>“Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!” deliriously howled Ahab, as di malignant iron scorchingly devour di baptismal blood.</p>
<p>Now, mustering di spare poles fram below, an selecting one a hickory, wid di bark still a invest it, Ahab fit di end to di socket a di iron. A coil a new tow-line did den unwound, an some fathoms a it tek to di windlass, an stretch to a great tension. Press him foot pan it, til di rope hum like a harp-string, den eagerly bend ova it, an seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, “Good! an now fi di seizings.”</p>
<p>At one extremity di rope neva stranded, an di separate spread yarns dem did all braided an woven roun di socket a di harpoon; di pole did den drive hard up inna di socket; fram di lower end di rope did trace half-way along di pole's length, an firmly secure so, wid intertwistings a twine. Dis don, pole, iron, an rope—like di Three Fates—remain inseparable, an Ahab moodily stalk weh wid di weapon; di sound a him ivory leg, an di sound a di hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere him did enter him cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound did hear. Oh, Pip! yuh wretched laugh, yuh idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended wid di black tragedy a di melancholy ship, an mock it!</p>
