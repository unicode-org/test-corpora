<h2 id="pgepubid00015">CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.</h2>
<p>Wen mi go back to di Spouter-Inn fram di Chapel, mi find Queequeg deh quite alone; him did lef di Chapel before di benediction some time. Im did a sidong pan a bench before di fire, wid im fut dem pan di stove hearth, an inna one han im did a hold close up to im face dat deh likkle negro idol a im; peering hard inna it face, an wid a jack-knife gently whittling weh at it nose, meanwhile humming to himself inna him heathenish way.</p>
<p>Bot wen dem did a taak bout im, im put op di imij; an pretty soon, goh to di table, tek up a big book deh, an put it pan him lap an staat count di pages dem wid deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page—as mi did a fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly roun him, an give utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. Im woulda den staat again at di next fifty; seeming fi staat at numba one each time, as if him couldn't count more dan fifty, an it was only by such a large number a fifties being found together, dat him astonishment at di multitude a pages did excited.</p>
<p>Wid nof inchres mi sidong a wach im. Savage though him was, an hideously marred bout di face—at least to mi taste—him countenance yet did have a someting inna it weh was by no means disagreeable. Yuh cyaan hide di soul. Thru all him unearthly tattooings, mi did tink mi did see di traces a one simple honest heart; an inna him big, deep eyes, fiery black an bold, deh did look like tokens a one spirit weh woulda dare a thousand devils. An besides all dis, deh did have a certain lofty bearing bout di Pagan, weh even him uncouthness couldn't altogether maim. Im look like a man weh neva cringe an neva have a creditor. Weda it was, too, dat him head did a shave, him forehead did a draw out inna freeer an brighter relief, an look more expansive dan it woulda woulda, dis mi naa go venture fi decide; but certain it was him head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it remind mi a General Washington's head, as seen inna di popular busts a him. It did have di same long regularly graded retreating slope fram above di brows, weh did likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded pan top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.</p>
<p>Whilst mi did a scan him so closely, half-pretending meanwhile fi be looking out at di storm fram di casement, him neva heed mi presence, neva trouble himself wid so much as a single glance; but did look wholly occupied wid counting di pages a di marvelous book. Wen mi tink bout how sociably wi did a sleep tugeda di night before, an espeshali wen mi tink di affectionate arm weh mi did find throw ova mi wen mi did a wake up inna di morning, mi did tink dis indifference a him very strange. But savages a strange beings; somtaim yuh no know exactly how fi tek dem. At first dem a overawing; dem calm self-collectedness a simplicity look like a Socratic wisdom. Mi did notice also seh Queequeg neva consort at all, or but very likkle, wid di ada seamen dem inna di inn. Him neva mek no advances at all; did look like him neva have no desire fi enlarge di circle a him acquaintances. All dis struck mi as mighty singular; yet, pan second thoughts, deh did have someting almost sublime inna it. Yahso was a man bout twenty thousand miles fram yaad, by di way a Cape Horn, dat is—weh was di only way him coulda get deh—throw mongx people as strange to him as if him did deh inna di planet Jupiter; an yet him did look entirely at him ease; preserving di utmost serenity; content wid him own companionship; aalwiez iikual tu imself. Surely dis was a touch a fine philosophy; though no doubt him neva hear seh a did such a ting as dat. But, perhaps, fi be true philosophers, wi mortals shudn't be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as mi hear seh such or such a man gi himself out fi a philosopher, mi conclude seh, like di dyspeptic ole woman, him mus have “broken him digester.”</p>
<p>As mi did a sidong deh inna dat deh now lonely room; di fire a bon low, inna dat deh mild stage wen, afta it fos intensity don warm di air, it den only glow fi be looked at; di evening shades an phantoms dem a gather roun di casements, an a peering in upon wi silent, solitary twain; di storm booming widout in solemn swells; Mi staat fi be sensible a strange feelings. Mi did feel a melting inna mi. No more mi splintered heart an maddened han dem did turn against di wolfish world. Dis soothing savage did redeem it. Deh him did sidong, him very indifference did a taak bout a nature in which deh neva have no civilized hypocrisies an bland deceits. Wild him was; a very sight a sights fi see; yet mi staat feel miself mysteriously drawn towards him. An dem same ting deh weh woulda did repel most others, dem was di very magnets weh thus draw mi. Mi ago try a pagan fren, mi did tink, since Christian kindness don prove but hollow courtesy. Mi draw mi bench near him, an mek some friendly signs an hints, doing mi bes fi talk wid him meanwhile. At first him likkle notice dem advances yah; but presently, wen mi did a refer to him last night's hospitalities, him mek out fi ask mi if wi did a go be bedfellows again. Mi tell him yes; weh mi did tink him did look pleased, perhaps a likkle complimented.</p>
<p>Den wi turn ova di book tugeda, an mi try fi explain to him di purpose a di printing, an di meaning a di few picture dem weh did deh inna it. So mi soon engage him interest; an fram dat wi go a jabbering di bes wi coulda bout di various outer sights dem weh yuh can see inna dis famous town. Soon mi propose a social smoke; an, producing him pouch an tomahawk, him quietly offer mi a puff. An den wi sidong a exchange puffs fram dat deh wild pipe a him, an kip it regularly a paas bitwiin wi.</p>
<p>If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards mi inna di Pagan's breast, dis pleasant, genial smoke we did have, soon thaw it out, an lef wi cronies. Him did look like him did a tek mi quite as naturally an unbiddenly as mi to him; an wen wi smoke don, him press him forehead against mine, clasp mi roun mi waist, an seh dat henceforth wi did married; meaning, inna him country's phrase, dat we was bosom frens; him woulda gladly dead fi mi, if need fi be. Inna a countryman, dis sudden flame a friendship woulda did look far too premature, a ting fi be much distrusted; but inna dis simple savage dem old rules deh wouldn't apply.</p>
<p>Afta supper, an anodda social chat an smoke, wi go a wi room tugeda. Him mek mi a present a him embalmed head; tek out him enormous tobacco wallet, an groping unda di tobacco, draw out some thirty dollars inna silver; den spread dem pan di table, an mechanically divide dem inna two equal portions, push one a dem towards mi, an seh a fi mi. Mi did a go remonstrate; but him silent mi by pourring dem inna mi trowsers' pockets. Mi mek dem stay. Den him go bout him evening prayers, tek out him idol, an tek weh di paper fireboard. By certain signs an symptoms, mi did tink him did a seem anxious fi mi fi join him; but well knowing weh did a go follow, mi deliberate a moment weda, in case him invite mi, mi woulda comply or otherwise.</p>
<p>Mi was a good Christian; born an bred inna di bosom a di infallible Presbyterian Church. How den mi coulda unite wid dis wild idolator inna worship him piece a wood? But weh a worship? mi did tink. Yuh tink now, Ishmael, seh di magnanimous God a heaven an earth—pagans an all included—can possibly be jealous a an insignificant bit a black wood? Impassible! Bot wa a worship?—fi du wa Gad waahn— <i>dat</i> a worship. An wa Gad waahn?—fi du tu mi fren dem wa mi waahn mi fren dem fi du tu mi— <i>dat</i> a wa Gad waahn mi fi du. Now, Queequeg a mi fellow man. An weh mi wish seh dis Queequeg woulda do to mi? Why, unite wid mi inna mi particular Presbyterian form a worship. So, mi haffi den unite wid him inna him; ergo, mi haffi turn idolator. So mi kindle di shavings; help prop up di innocent likkle idol; offer him burnt biscuit wid Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kiss him nose; an dat don, wi tek aaf wi kluoz an go a bed, at peace wid wi own consciences an all di worl. But wi neva go sleep widout some likkle chat.</p>
<p>How it is mi nuh know; but no place nuh deh like a bed fi confidential disclosures between frens. Man an wife, dem seh, dem open di very bottom a dem soul to each other; an some old couples often lie an chat ova old times til nearly morning. So, den, inna wi heart's honeymoon, lay mi an Queequeg—a cosy, loving pair.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00016">CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.</h2>
<p>Wi did a lay so inna bed, a chat an a nap at short intervals, an Queequeg now an den affectionately a throw him brown tattooed legs ova mine, an den a draw dem back; so entirely sociable an free an easy did wi; wen, at last, by reason a wi confabulations, weh likkle nappishness weh did lef inna wi altogether departed, an wi did feel like get up again, though day-break did deh yet some way dung di future.</p>
<p>Yes, wi did become very wakeful; so much so dat wi recumbent position staat grow wearisome, an by likkle an likkle wi find wiself a sidong op; di clothes dem well tucked roun wi, leaning against di head-board wid wi four knees dem drawn up close together, an wi two noses dem bend ova dem, as if wi kneepans dem was warming-pans. Wi did feel very nice an snug, di more so since it did so chilly out a doors; indeed out a bed-clothes too, seeing dat deh neva have no fire inna di room. Di more so, mi seh, cause fi truly enjoy bodily warmth, some likkle part a yuh haffi be cold, cause nuh quality nuh deh inna dis ya worl weh nuh deh weh it is merely by contrast. Notn no deh inna itself. If yuh flatter yuhself seh yuh all ova comfortable, an yuh have so a long time, den yuh cyaan seh yuh comfortable no more. But if, like Queequeg an mi inna di bed, di tip a yuh nose or di crown a yuh head be slightly chilled, why den, indeed, inna di general consciousness yuh feel most delightfully an unmistakably warm. Fi dis reason a sleeping apartment shudn't be furnished wid a fire, weh a one a di luxurious discomforts a di rich. For di height a dis sort a deliciousness is fi have notn but di blanket between yuh an yuh snugness an di cold a di outer air. Den deh yuh lie like di one warm spark inna di heart a one arctic crystal.</p>
<p>Wi did a sidong inna dis crouching manner fi some time, wen all at once mi tink mi woulda open mi eyes; fi wen between sheets, weda by day or by night, an weda asleep or awake, mi have a way fi always keep mi eyes shut, in order di more fi concentrate di snugness a being inna bed. Bikaaz no man can eva feel him own identity aright except him eyes dem be close; as if darkness was indeed di proper element a wi essences, though light be more congenial to wi clayy part. Wen mi open mi eyes den, an come outa mi own pleasant an self-created darkness inna di imposed an coarse outer gloom a di unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, mi experience a disagreeable revulsion. Mi neva at all object to di hint fram Queequeg seh perhaps it was best fi strike a light, seeing dat we did so wide awake; an besides him did feel a strong desire fi have a few quiet puffs fram him Tomahawk. Be it said, dat though mi did feel such a strong repugnance to him smoking inna di bed di night before, yet see how elastic wi stiff prejudices grow wen love once come fi bend dem. Fi now mi neva like notn beta dan fi have Queequeg a smoke by mi, even inna bed, cause him did look like him did full a such serene household joy den. Mi no more feel unduly concerned fi di landlord's policy a insurance. Mi did only alive to di condensed confidential comfortableness a sharing a pipe an a blanket wid a real fren. Wid wi shaggy jackets dem drawn roun wi shoulda dem, wi now pass di Tomahawk fram one to di ada, til slowly deh grow ova wi a blue hanging tester a smoke, illuminated by di flame a di new-lit lamp.</p>
<p>Weda it was dat dis undulating tester roll di savage weh to far distant scenes, mi no know, but him now did a taak bout him native island; an, eager fi hear him history, mi beg him fi go on an tell it. Im gladly comply. Though at di time mi but ill comprehend not a few a him words, yet subsequent disclosures, wen mi did become more familiar wid him broken phraseology, now enable mi fi present di whole story such as it may prove inna di mere skeleton mi give.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00017">CHAPTER 12. Biographical.</h2>
<p>Queequeg was a native a Rokovoko, an island far away to di West an South. It no deh dung inna no map; true places neva deh.</p>
<p>Wen a new-hatched savage running wild bout him native woodlands inna a grass clout, followed by di nibbling goats, as if him was a green sapling; even den, inna Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire fi see someting more a Christendom dan a specimen whaler or two. Him fadda was a High Chief, a King; him uncle a High Priest; an pan di maternal side him did a boast bout aunts weh did a di wives a unconquerable warriors. A did excellent blood inna him veins—royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, mi fear, by di cannibal propensity weh him nourish inna him untored youth.</p>
<p>A Sag Harbour ship did visit him fadda bay, an Queequeg did a look fi a passage to Christian lans. But di ship, wid har full complement a seamen, spurned him suit; an not all di King him faada influence coulda prevail. But Queequeg vow a vow. Alone inna him canoe, him paddle off to a distant strait, weh him did know di ship mus pass through wen she quit di island. Pan one side was a coral reef; pan di ada one a low tongue a lan, cover wid mangrove thickets weh did a grow out inna di wata. Hiding him canoe, still a float, mongst dem thickets deh, wid it prow seaward, him sidong inna di stern, paddle low inna han; an wen di ship did a glide by, like a flash him dart out; gain har side; wid one backward dash a him foot capsized an sink him canoe; climbed up di chains; an throw himself at full length pan di deck, grapple a ring-bolt deh, an swore not fi let it go, though hacked inna pieces.</p>
<p>In vain di captain threaten fi throw him ovaboard; suspended a cutlass ova him naked wrists; Queequeg was di son a one King, an Queequeg neva budge. Struck by him desperate dauntlessness, an him wild desire fi visit Christendom, di captain at last relent, an tell him him might mek himself at home. But dis fine young savage—dis sea Prince of Wales, neva si di Captain's cabin. Dem put him dung mongst di sailors, an mek him a whaleman. But like Czar Peter content fi toil inna di shipyards a foreign cities, Queequeg did disdain no seeming ignominy, if thereby him coulda happily gain di power a enlighten him untored countrymen. For at bottom—so him tell mi—him did a actuated by a profound desire fi learn mongst di Christians, di arts weh fi mek him people still happier dan dem did; an more dan dat, still better dan dem did. But, alas! di practices a whalemen soon convince him seh even Christians coulda be both miserable an wicked; infinitely more so, dan all him fadda heathens. Arrived at last inna old Sag Harbor; an si weh di sailors dem did a do deh; an den go aan tu Nantucket, an si ou dem spen dem pie ina <i>da</i> plies de tu, puor Queequeg gi it op fi luuz. Im did tink, a one wicked worl inna all meridians; Mi a-go ded a piegan.</p>
<p>An so an old idolator at heart, him did still live mongst dem Christians deh, did a wear dem clothes, an did a try talk dem gibberish. So di queer ways bout him, though now some time fram yaad.</p>
<p>By hints, mi ask him if him neva propose fi go back, an have a coronation; since him might now consider him fadda dead an gone, him being very old an feeble at di last accounts. Im ansa seh no, not yet; an him add seh him did fraid seh Christianity, or rather Christians, did unfit him fi ascend di pure an undefiled throne a thirty pagan Kings before him. But by an by, him seh, him woulda come back,—as soon as him feel himself baptize again. Fi di nonce, however, him propose fi sail bout, an sow him wild oats inna all four oceans. Dem did mek a harpooneer a him, an dat deh barbed iron did deh inna di place a one sceptre now.</p>
<p>Mi ask him weh might be him immediate purpose, touching him future movements. Im ansa, fi go a sea agen, inna im uol vocation. Pan dis, mi tell him seh whaling a mi own design, an mi tell him bout mi intention fi sail out a Nantucket, as being di most promising port fi an adventurous whaleman fi embark fram. Im at once resolve fi accompany mi to dat island, ship aboard di same vessel, get inna di same watch, di same boat, di same mess wid mi, in short fi share mi every hap; wid both mi han dem inna him, boldly dip inna di Potluck a both worlds. To all dis mi joyously assent; fi besides di affection mi did a feel now fi Queequeg, him was an experienced harpooneer, an as such, couldn't fail fi be a great usefulness to one, who, like mi, was wholly ignorant a di mysteries a whaling, though well acquainted wid di sea, as known to merchant seamen.</p>
<p>Him story did a end wid him pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg embrace mi, press him forehead against mine, an blowing out di light, we roll ova fram each other, dis way an dat, an very soon did a sleep.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00018">CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.</h2>
<p>Next maanin, Monday, afta mi dispose di embalmed head to a barber, fi a block, mi settle mi own an comrade's bill; using, however, mi comrade's money. Di grinning landlord, as well as di boarders, did look amazingly tickled at di sudden friendship weh did spring up between mi an Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin's cock an bull stories bout him did previously so much alarmed mi concerning di very person weh mi now companied wid.</p>
<p>Wi borrow a wheelbarrow, an embarking wi tings, including mi own poor carpet-bag, an Queequeg's canvas sack an hammock, away wi go dung to “di Moss,” di likkle Nantucket packet schooner weh moor a di wharf. As we did a go along di people dem did a stare; not at Queequeg so much—cause dem did use to see cannibals like him inna dem streets,—but at seeing him an mi pan such confidential terms. But we neva heed dem, going along wheeling di barrow by turns, an Queequeg now an den stop fi adjust di sheath pan him harpoon barbs. Mi ask him why him carry such a troublesome ting wid him asshore, an weda all whaling ships neva find dem own harpoons. To dis, in substance, him reply, dat though weh mi hint was true enough, yet him did have a particular affection fi him own harpoon, cause it was of assured stuff, well tryed in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate wid the hearts of whales. In short, like plenty inland reapers an mowers, who go inna di farmers' meadows armed wid dem own scythes—though in no wise obliged fi furnish dem—even so, Queequeg, fi him own private reasons, did prefer him own harpoon.</p>
<p>Shifting di barrow fram mi han to him, him tell mi a funny story bout di first wheelbarrow weh him eva si. It did deh inna Sag Harbor. Di owna dem a him ship, it look like, did len him one, in which fi carry him heavy chest to him boarding house. Not fi seem ignorant bout di ting—though in truth him did entirely so, concerning di precise way in which fi manage di barrow—Queequeg put him chest pan it; lashes it fast; an den shoulda di barrow an march op di wharf. “Wa mek,” mi se, “Kwiequeg, yu maita did nuo beta dan dat, wan wuda tingk. Di piipl dem neva laaf?”</p>
<p>Pan dis, him tell mi anodda story. Di people dem a him island a Rokovoko, it seems, at dem wedding feasts express di fragrant water a young cocoanuts inna a big stained calabash like a punchbowl; an dis punchbowl always form di great central ornament pan di braided mat weh di feast is hold. Now a certain grand merchant ship once touch at Rokovoko, an its commander—from all accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least fi a sea captain—dis commander was invited to di wedding feast a Queequeg's sista, a pretty young princess jus turn of ten. Well; wen all di wedding guests dem did assemble a di bride's bamboo cottage, dis Captain march in, an being assigned di post a honor, place himself ova against di punchbowl, an between di High Priest an him majesty di King, Queequeg's fadda. Grace being said,—fi dem people deh have dem grace as well as wi—though Queequeg tell mi seh unlike wi, weh at such times look dung to wi platters, dem, pan di contrary, copy di ducks, glance upwards to di great Giver a all feasts—Grace, mi seh, being said, di High Priest open di banquet by di immemorial a di ceremony a di land; dat mean, dip him consecrated an consecrating finga dem inna di bowl before di blessed beverage circulates. Wen him si himself placed next di Priest, an noting di ceremony, an tink himself—being Captain a one ship—as having plain precedence ova a mere island King, especially inna di King's own house—di Captain coolly proceeds fi wash him han dem inna di punchbowl;—tek it mi suppose fi a huge finger-glass. “Now,” Queequeg seh, “weh yuh tink now?—Wi people dem neva laugh?”</p>
<p>At last, passage pay, an luggage safe, we stan up pan di schooner. Hoisting sail, it glide dung di Acushnet river. Pan one side, New Bedford did a rose inna terraces a streets, dem ice-covered trees all a glitter inna di clear, cold air. Huge hills an mountains a casks pan casks did pail op pan har wharves, an side by side di world-wandering whale ships dem did lay silent an safely moored at last; while fram ada people come a sound a carpenters an coopers, wid blended noises a fires an forges fi melt di pitch, all betokening seh new cruises did a start; dat one most perilous an long voyage end, only staat a second; an a secan end, only staat a third, an so on, fi eva an fi aye. Such is di endlessness, yea, di intolerableness a all earthly effort.</p>
<p>Gainin di more open water, di bracing breeze wax fresh; di likkle Moss toss di quick foam fram har bows, as a young colt him snortings. How mi snuff dat Tartar air!—how mi spurn dat deh turnpike earth!—dat common highway all ova dented wid di marks a slavish heels an hoofs; an turn mi fi admire di magnanimity a di sea weh naa go permit no records.</p>
<p>At di same foam-fountain, Queequeg did look like him did a drink an reel wid mi. Him dusky nostrils swell apart; him show him filed an pointed teet dem. On, on we fly; an wi offing gained, di Moss did homage to di blast; ducked an dive har bows as a slave before di Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; di two tall masts dem a buckle like Indian canes inna land tornadoes. So full a dis reeling scene wi did deh, as we did a stan op by di plunging bowsprit, dat fi some time wi neva notice di jeering glances a di passengers dem, a lubber-like assembly, weh did a marvel seh two fellow beings shuda be so companionable; as if a white man was anyting more dignified dan a whitewashed negro. But deh did have some boobies an bumpkins deh, who, by dem intense greenness, mus did come fram di heart an center a all verdure. Queequeg ketch one a dem young saplings deh a mimick him behind him back. Mi did tink seh di bumpkin's hour a doom did come. Dropping him harpoon, di brawny savage ketch him inna him arms, an by an almost miraculous dexterity an strength, sen him high up bodily inna di air; den slightly tapping him stern inna mid-somerset, di fellow land wid bursting lungs pan him feet, while Queequeg, turning him back pan him, light him tomahawk pipe an pass it to mi fi a puff.</p>
<p>“Capting! Capting!” di bumpkin baal out, a run towards dat deh officer; “Capting, Capting, yahso di devil deh.”</p>
<p>“Hallo, <i>yuh</i> sir,” di Captain baal out, a gaunt rib a di sii, a stalk op tu Queequeg, “we inna tonda yu miin bai dat? Yu no nuo se yu maita kil da chap de?”</p>
<p>“Weh him seh?” seh Queequeg, as him mildly turn to mi.</p>
<p>“Im seh,” mi seh, “dat yuh did come near kill-e dat deh man deh,” pointing to di still shivering greenhorn.</p>
<p>“Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting him tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”</p>
<p>“Look yuh,” di Captain roar, “Mi ago kill-e <i>yuh</i> , yuh cannibal, if yuh try any more a yuh tricks abord yah; so mind yuh eye.”</p>
<p>But it so happen jus den, dat a did high time fi di Captain fi mind him own eye. Di prodigious strain pan di main-sail did part di weather-sheet, an di tremendous boom did a fly now fram side to side, completely sweeping di entire afta part a di deck. Di poor fellow weh Queequeg did handle so roughly, did get sweep ovaboard; all han dem did inna a panic; an fi try snatch di boom fi stay it, did look madness. It fly fram right to left, an back again, almost inna one ticking a watch, an every instant did look like it did a snap inna splinters. Notn neva done, an notn neva look like it coulda be done; dem pan di deck rush towards di bows, an stan up a look pan di boom as if it was di lower jaw a one exasperated whale. Inna di midst a dis consternation, Queequeg drop deftly to him knees, an crawl unda di path a di boom, whip hold a one rope, secure one end to di bulwarks, an den fling di ada one like a lasso, ketch it roun di boom as it sweep ova him head, an at di neks way, dat was safe, an all dat was safe. Di schooner did a run inna di wind, an while di hands dem did a clear weh di stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to di waist, darted fram di side wid a long living arc a leap. Fi three minutes or more dem did si him a swim like a dog, a throw him long arms straight out before him, an by turns a reveal him brawny shoulda dem chruu di freezing foam. Mi look pan di grand an glorious fellow, but mi neva si nobadi fi get siev. Di greenhorn did gaan dung. Shooting himself perpendicularly fram di wata, Queequeg, now tek a instant's glance roun him, an seeming him did a si jus how matters did deh, dive dung an disappear. A few minutes more, an him rise again, one arm still a strike out, an wid di ada one a drag a lifeless form. Di boat soon pick dem up. Di poor bumpkin did restore. All hands vote Queequeg a noble trump; di captain beg him pardon. Fram dat deh hour mi clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, til poor Queequeg tek him last long dive.</p>
<p>Yuh eva have such unconsciousness? Im neva did tink seh im did at all deserve a medal fram di Humane an Magnanimous Societies. Him only ask fi water—fresh water—someting fi wipe di brine off; dat done, him put on dry clothes, light him pipe, an lean against di bulwarks, an mildly eyeing dem roun him, seemed him did a seh to himself—“It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. Wi cannibals haffi help dem Christians yah.”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00019">CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.</h2>
<p>Notn more happen pan di passage weh worthy di mention; so, afta a fine run, wi safely arrive inna Nantucket.</p>
<p>Nantucket! Tek out yuh map an look pan it. Si weh a real corner a di worl it occupy; how it stan deh, weh off shore, more lonely dan di Eddystone lighthouse. Look pan it—a mere hillock, an elbow a sand; all beach, widout a background. Deh have more sand deh dan yuh woulda use inna twenty years as a substitute fi blotting paper. Some gamesome wights ago tell yuh seh dem haffi plant weeds deh, dem nuh grow naturally; dat dem import Canada thistles; dat dem haffi sen beyond seas fi a spile fi stop a leak inna an oil cask; dat pieces a wood inna Nantucket dem carry bout like bits a di true cross inna Rome; dat people deh deh plant toadstools before dem house, fi get unda di shade inna summer time; dat one blade a grass mek an oasis, three blades inna a day's walk a prairie; dat dem wear quicksand shoes, someting like Laplander snow-shoes; dat dem so shut up, belt bout, every way inclosed, surrounded, an mek an utter island of by di ocean, dat to dem very chairs an tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But dem extravaganzas yah only show seh Nantucket a nuh Illinois.</p>
<p>Look now at di wondrous traditional story bout how dis island did settle by di red-men. So di legend go. Inna olden times an eagle swoop dung upon di New England coast, an carry off an infant Indian inna him talons. Wid loud lament di parents dem si dem pikni born out a sight ova di wide waters. Dem did decide fi follow inna di same direction. Wen dem set out inna dem canoes, afta a perilous passage dem discover di island, an deh dem find a empty ivory casket,—di poor likkle Indian's skeleton.</p>
<p>Weh wonder, den, dat dem Nantucketers yah, weh born pan a beach, shuda tek to di sea fi a livelihood! Dem fos ketch crabs an quohogs inna di sand; grown bolder, dem wade out wid nets fi mackerel; more experienced, dem push off inna boats an capture cod; an at last, launching a navy a great ships pan di sea, explore dis watery world; put a incessant belt a circumnavigations roun it; peeped in at Behring's Straits; an inna all seasons an all oceans declare everlasting war wid di mightiest animated mass weh survive di flood; most monstrous an most mountainous! Dat Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed wid such portentousness a unconscious power, dat him very panics dem more fi be dreaded dan him most fearless an malicious assaults!</p>
<p>An so dem naked Nantucketers yah, dem sea hermits yah, weh did a come outa dem ant-hill inna di sea, overrun an conquere di watery worl like so many Alexanders; parcelling out mongst dem di Atlantic, Pacific, an Indian oceans, as di three pirate powers did Poland. Mek America add Mexico to Texas, an pile Cuba upon Canada; mek di English overswarm all India, an hang out dem blazing banner fram di sun; two thirds a dis terraqueous globe a di Nantucketer's. Kaaz di sii a fi im; him own it, as Emperors own empires; ada seamen dem have but a right a way through it. Merchant ships dem a but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates an privateers, though dem did a follow di sea as highwaymen di road, dem but plunder other ships, other fragments a di lan like demself, widout seeking fi draw dem living fram di bottomless deep itself. Di Nantucketer, him alone live an riots pan di sea; him alone, inna Bible language, go dung to it inna ships; to an fro plowing it as him own special plantation. <i>Deh</i> deh him yaad; <i>deh</i> deh him business, weh a Noah's flood wouldn't interrupt, though it overwhelm all di millions inna China. Him live pan di sea, as prairie cocks inna di prairie; him hide mongst di waves, him climb dem as chamois hunters climb di Alps. Fi years him nuh know di lan; so dat wen him come to it at last, it smell like anodda world, more strangely dan di moon woulda to an Earthsman. Wid di landless gull, weh at sunset fold har wings an get rock fi sleep between billows; so at nightfall, di Nantucketer, outa sight a lan, furls him sails, an lay him to him rest, while unda him very pillow rush herds a walruses an whales.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00020">CHAPTER 15. Chowder.</h2>
<p>A did quite late inna di evening wen di likkle Moss come snugly fi anchor, an Queequeg an mi go asshore; so wi couldn't attend to no business dat deh day deh, at least none but a supper an a bed. Di landlord a di Spouter-Inn did recommend wi to him cousin Hosea Hussey a di Try Pots, whom him assert fi be di proprietor a one a di bes kept hotels inna all Nantucket, an moreover him did assure wi seh Cousin Hosea, as him call him, did famous fi him chowders. In short, him plainly hint seh wi couldn't possibly do betta dan try pot-luck at di Try Pots. But di directions dem weh him did gi wi bout keeping a yellow warehouse pan wi starboard han til wi open a white church to di larboard, an den keep dat pan di larboard han til wi mek a corner three points to di starboard, an dat done, den ask di first man weh wi meet weh di place did deh: dem crooked directions yah a him very much puzzled wi at first, especially at the queee insist seh di yellow warehouse—we first point a departure—mos be lef pan di larboard han, whereas mi did andastan Peter Coffin fi seh it deh pan di starboard. However, by dint a beat bout a likkle inna di dark, an now an den knock up a peaceable inhabitant fi inquire di way, wi at last come to someting weh neva mistaking.</p>
<p>Two enormous wooden pots paint black, an suspended by asses' ears, swing fram di cross-trees a one old top-mast, planted in front a one old doorway. Di horn dem a di cross-trees dem did saw off pan di ada side, so dat dis ole top-mast did look not a likkle like a gallows. Miebi mi did uova sensitiv tu demde kain a impreshan de a di taim, bot mi kudn elp stier pan dis gallows wid a vague misgiving. A sort a crick did deh inna mi neck as mi did a look up to di two horn dem weh did lef; yes, <i>two</i> a dem, one fi Queequeg, an one fi mi. It ominous, tink I. A Coffin mi Innkeeper upon landing inna mi first whaling port; tombstones staring at mi inna di whalemen's chapel; an yahso a gallows! an a pair a prodigious black pots too! Dem last throw out oblique hints touching Tophet?</p>
<p>Mi did get call fram dem reflections yah by di sight a one freckled woman wid yellow hair an a yellow gown, stan up inna di porch a di inn, unda a dull red lamp swinging deh, weh look much like an injured eye, an carrying on a brisk scolding wid a man inna a purple woolen shirt.</p>
<p>“Go aan wid unu,” shi se tu di man, “ar mi wi komb unu!”</p>
<p>“Come on, Queequeg,” seh mi, “all right. Deh deh Mrs. Hussey.”</p>
<p>An so it turn out; Mr. Hosea Hussey did come fram yaad, but lef Mrs. Hussey entirely competent fi attend to all him affairs. Wen wi did a mek wi nuo wi did waahn a supper an a bed, Mrs. Hussey, an did a postpon wi muor scolding fi di present, an tek wi inna wan likl ruum, an put wi sidong a wan tiebl weh did spred wid di relics a wan repast we did don jos don, ton roun tu wi an se—“Clam or Cod?”</p>
<p>“Weh dat bout Cods, ma'am?” seh mi, wid much politeness.</p>
<p>“Clam or Cod?” she repeated.</p>
<p>“A clam fi supper? a cold clam; a <i>dat</i> yuh mean, Mrs. Hussey?” seh mi, “but dat a one rada cold an clammy reception inna di winta time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?”</p>
<p>But being in a great hurry fi resume scolding di man inna di purple Shirt, weh did a wait fi it inna di entry, an seeming fi hear nutten but di wod “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurry towards an open door weh did a lead to di kitchen, an bawling out “clam fi two,” disappear.</p>
<p>“Queequeg,” mi seh, “yuh tink seh wi can mek out a supper fi wi both pan one clam?”</p>
<p>However, a warm savory steam fram di kitchen did serve fi belie di apparently cheerless prospect weh did deh before wi. But wen dat deh smoking chowder come in, di mystery did delightfully explain. Oh, sweet frens! lisn tu mi. It did mek outa likl juicy clams, scarcely bigger dan hazel nuts, mix wid pounded ship biscuit, an salted pork cut up inna likkle flakes; di whole enriched wid butter, an plentifully seasoned wid pepper an salt. Wi appetite dem did a sharpen by di frosty voyage, an in particular, Queequeg did a si him favourite fishing food before him, an di chowder did a surpassingly excellent, wi did a sen it wid great expedition: wen mi did a lean back a moment an did a tink bout Mrs. Hussey's clam an cod announcement, mi did tink seh mi woulda try a likkle experiment. Step to di kitchen door, mi utter di wod “cod” wid great emphasis, an resume mi seat. Inna a few moments di savory steam come out again, but wid a different flavor, an inna good time a fine cod-chowder did put before wi.</p>
<p>Wi staat business agen; an while plying wi spoons inna di bowl, mi tink to miself, mi wonder now if dis yah have any effect pan di head? Weh dat stultifying saying bout chowder-headed people? “Bot luk, Kwiin, a no laiv il dat inna yu boul?We yu haapun de?”</p>
<p>Fishiest a all fishy places was di Try Pots, weh well deserve it name; fi di pot dem deh did always a boiling chowders. Chowder fi breakfast, an chowder fi dinner, an chowder fi supper, til yuh staat look fi fish-bones a come chruu yuh clothes. Di area before di house did pave wid clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey did a wear a polished necklace a codfish vertebra; an Hosea Hussey did have him account books bound inna superior old shark-skin. Deh did have a fishy flavor to di milk, too, weh mi couldn't at all account fi, til one morning happenin fi tek a stroll along di beach mongst some fishermen's boats, mi si Hosea's brindled cow a feed pan fish remnants, an a march along di sand wid each foot inna a cod's decapitated head, looking very decapitated, as mi yehod.</p>
<p>Supper don, wi get a lamp, an directions fram Mrs. Hussey bout di nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg did bout fi precede mi up di stairs, di lady reach forth har arm, an demand him harpoon; shi neva allow no harpoon inna har chambers. "Wah mek?" mi seh; “every true whaleman sleep wid him harpoon—but why not?” “Bikaaz it denjaros,” shi se. “Ever since young Stiggs coming fram dat unfort'nt v'y'ge a him, wen him did gaan four years an a half, wid only three barrels a <i>ile</i> , dem did find him dead inna mi first floor back, wid him harpoon inna him side; ever since den mi allow no boarders fi tek sich dangerous weepons inna dem rooms at night, Queefore did laan his. name), “Mi ago jus tek dis yah iron, an kip it fi yuh til maanin. But di chowder; clam or cod to-morrow fi breakfast, man?”</p>
<p>“Both,” mi seh; “an mek wi have a couple a smoked herring by way a variety.”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00021">CHAPTER 16. Di Ship.</h2>
<p>Inna bed wi did a concoct wi plans fi di morrow. But to mi surprise an no small concern, Queequeg now gi mi fi andastan, seh him did a diligently consult Yojo—di name a him black likkle god—an Yojo did tell him two or three times ova, an strongly insist pan it everyway, dat instead a wi go tugeda mongst di whaling-fleet inna harbor, an inna concert select wi craft; instead a dis, mi seh, Yojo earnestly enjoined dat di selection a di ship shuda rest wholly wid mi, inasmuch as Yojo purpose befriending us; an, fi do so, mi did already pitch pan a vessel, weh, if mi did lef to miself, mi, Ishmael, woulda infallibly light pan, fi all di worl as if it did turn out by chance; an inna dat deh vessel mi haffi ship miself immediately, fi di present irrespective a Queequeg.</p>
<p>Mi forget fi mention seh, inna nuff tings, Queequeg did place great confidence inna di excellence a Yojo's judgment an surprising forecast a tings; an cherished Yojo wid considerable esteem, as a rather good sort a god, who perhaps mean well enough pan di whole, but in all cases neva succeed inna him benevolent designs.</p>
<p>Now, dis plan a Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching di selection a wi craft; Mi neva like dat deh plan at all. Mi neva did a likkle relied pan Queequeg's sagacity fi point out di whaler weh did bes fit fi carry wi an wi fortunes securely. But as all mi remonstrances neva produce no effect upon Queequeg, mi did obliged fi acquiesce; an accordingly prepared fi set bout dis business wid a determined rushing sort a energy an vigor, dat shuda quickly settle dat trifling likkle affair. Next maanin early, lef Queequeg shut up wid Yojo inna wi likkle bedroom—cause it did look like it was some sort a Lent or Ramadan, or day a fasting, humiliation, an prayer wid Queequeg an Yojo dat deh day; <i>how</i> it was mi neva coulda find out, fi, though mi did apply miself to it several times, mi neva coulda master him liturgies an XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, den, fasting pan him tomahawk pipe, an Yojo warming himself at him sacrificial fire a shavings, mi sallied out among di shipping. Afta mi laan seh a did three ship dem weh did a gwaan fi three-years voyages—Di Devil-dam, di Tit-bit, an di Pequod. <i>Devil-Dam</i> , mi no know di origin a; <i>Tit-bit</i> is obvious; <i>Pequod</i> , yuh wi no doubt memba, was di name a one celebrated tribe a Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as di ancient Medes. Mi peer an pry bout di Devil-dam; fram har, hop ova to di Tit-bit; an finally, go pan di Pequod, look roun har fi a moment, an den decide seh dis a di very ship fi wi.</p>
<p>Yuh maita don si plenty a quaint craft inna yuh day, fi aught mi know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, an weh not; but tek mi word fi it, yuh neva si such a rare old craft as dis same rare old Pequod. Shi was a ship of di old school, rather small if anyting; wid a old-fashioned claw-footed look bout har. Long seasoned an weather-stained inna di typhoons an calms a all four oceans, har ole hull's complexion did dark like a French grenadier's, weh did alike fight inna Egypt an Siberia. Har venerable bows did look bearded. Har masts—cut somewhere pan di coast a Japan, weh har original ones did lost ovaboard inna a gale—har masts did a stan op stiffly up like di spines a di three ole kings a Cologne. Har ancient decks dem did worn an wrinkled, like di pilgrim-worshiped flag-stone inna Canterbury Cathedral weh Becket bled. But to all dem har old antiquities, dem did add new an marvelous features, pertaining to di wild business weh fi more dan half a century she did a follow. Old Captain Peleg, fi nuff years har chief-mate, before him did a command anodda vessel a him own, an now a retired seaman, an one a di principal owners a di Pequod,—dis old Peleg, during di term a him chief-mateship, did build upon har original grotesqueness, an inlaid it, all ova, wid a quaintness both a material an device, unexcepted by it Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or bedstead. Shi did apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, him neck heavy wid pendants a polished ivory. Shi was a ting a trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking harself forth inna di chased bones a har enemies. All round, har unpaneled, open bulwarks dem did garnish like one continuous jaw, wid di long sharp teet dem a di sperm whale, insert deh fi pins, fi fasten har old hempen thews an tendons to. Dem deh thews deh neva run chruu base blocks a lan wood, but deftly travel ova sheaves a sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at har reverend helm, she sported deh a tiller; an dat deh tiller deh inna one mass, curiously carved fram di long narrow lower jaw a har hereditary foe. Di helmsman weh did a steer by dat deh tiller inna a tempest, did feel like di Tartar, wen him hold back him fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble tings dem touch wid dat.</p>
<p>Now wen mi look bout di quarter-deck, fi somebody weh have authority, fi propose miself as a candidate fi di voyage, at first mi neva si nobody; but mi couldn't well overlook a strange sort a tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a likkle behind di main-mast. It did look like a only a temporary erection weh dem use inna port. It was a conical shape, some ten feet high; consist a di long, huge slabs a limber black bone weh tek fram di middle an highest part a di jaws a di right-whale. Planted wid dem broad ends pan di deck, a circle a dem slabs deh lace tugeda, mutually sloped towards each other, an at di apex united inna a tufted point, weh di loose hairy fibers dem wave to an fro like di top-knot pan some old Pottowottamie Sachem's head. A triangular opening face towards di bows a di ship, so dat di insider command a complete view forward.</p>
<p>An half concealed inna dis queer tenement, mi at length find one weh by him aspect did look like him have authority; an who, it being noon, an di ship's work suspended, did a enjoy respite fram di burden a command. Him did a sidong pan a old-fashioned oaken chair, a wriggle all ova wid curious carving; an di bottom a weh did form out a stout interlacing a di same elastic stuff weh di wigwam did build a.</p>
<p>Notn neva deh so very particular, perhaps, bout di appearance a di elderly man weh mi si; him did brown an brawny, like most old seamen, an heavily roll up inna blue pilot-cloth, cut inna di Quaker style; only deh did have a fine an almost microscopic net-work a di minutest wrinkles dem weh did a interlace roun him eyes, weh mosi did come fram him continual sailings inna many hard gales, an always did a look to windward;—fi dis cause di muscles dem bout di eyes dem fi become pursed together. Dem deh eye-wrinkles deh very effectual inna a scowl.</p>
<p>“A di Captain a di Pequod dis?” mi seh, a goh to di door a di tent.</p>
<p>“Supposing it be di captain a di Pequod, weh yuh waan fram him?” him demand.</p>
<p>“Mi did a tink bout shipping.”</p>
<p>“Yuh was, yuh was? Mi see yuh a nuh Nantucketer—ever been inna a stove boat?”</p>
<p>“No, Sir, mi neva have.”</p>
<p>“Mi no know notn at all bout whaling, mi dare seh—eh?</p>
<p>“Notn, Sir; but mi no have no doubt mi shall soon laan. Mi don go a several voyages inna di merchant service, an mi tink seh—”</p>
<p>“Merchant service be damned. Talk not dat lingo to mi. Yuh see dat deh leg?—Mi ago tek dat deh leg weh fram yuh stern, if eva yuh talked bout di marchant service to mi again. Marchant service indeed! Mi suppose now yuh feel considerable proud a having served inna dem deh marchant ships. But flukes!, mek di man waan look? a likkle suspicious, don't it, eh?—Yuh neva been a pirate, noh?—Yuh neva rob yuh last Captain, noh?—Yuh neva tink bout murder di officers dem wen yuh get to sea?”</p>
<p>Mi protest mi innocence a dem ting deh. Mi si seh anda di mask a dem half humorous innuendoes yah, dis uol seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, did full a him insular prejudices, an rather distrustful a all aliens, unless dem did come fram Cape Cod or di Vineyard.</p>
<p>“But weh tek yuh a-whaling? Mi waan know dat before mi tink bout shipping yuh.”</p>
<p>“Wel, sa, mi waahn si wa wail animal miin. Mi waahn si di worl.”</p>
<p>“Yuh waan si weh whaling is, eh? Yuh clap eye pan Captain Ahab?”</p>
<p>“A who is Captain Ahab, sir?”</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, mi did tink so. Captain Ahab a di Captain a dis ship.”</p>
<p>“Mi mistaken den. Mi did tink seh mi did a talk to di Captain himself.”</p>
<p>“Yuh a talk to Captain Peleg—dat a who yuh a talk to, young man. It belong to mi an Captain Bildad fi see di Pequod fit out fi di voyage, an supply wid all har needs, including crew. Wi a part owners an agents. But as mi did a go seh, if yuh waan know weh yuh a tell, as yuh can put in way fi find it out before yuh bind yuhself to it, past backing out. Clap eye pan Captain Ahab, young man, an yuh wi find out seh him only have one leg.”</p>
<p>“Weh yuh mean, sa? Di ada one did lost by a whale?”</p>
<p>“Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to mi: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by di monstrousest parmacetty weh eva chip a boat!—ah, ah!”</p>
<p>Mi did a likkle alarmed by him energy, perhaps also a likkle touched at di hearty grief inna him concluding exclamation, but seh as calmly as mi could, “Weh yuh seh is no doubt true enough, sir; but how mi coulda know seh deh did have any peculiar ferocity inna dat deh particular whale, though indeed mi might have inferred as much from di simple accident.”</p>
<p>“Look yuh now, young man, yuh lungs dem a sort a soft, d'ye see; yuh nuh talk shark a bit. <i>Sure</i> , yuh been to sea before now; sure of dat?”</p>
<p>“Sir,” mi seh, “mi did tink mi did tell yuh seh mi did a four voyages inna di merchant—”</p>
<p>“Hard dung out a dat! Mind weh mi seh bout di marchant service—don't aggravate mi—mi naa go have it. But mek wi andastan each ada. Mi gi yuh a hint bout weh whaling is; yuh still feel inclined fi it?”</p>
<p>“Mi do, sa.”</p>
<p>“Very good. Now, yuh a di man fi pitch a harpoon dung a live whale throat, an den jump afta it? Answer, quick!”</p>
<p>“Mi is, sir, if it shuda be positively indispensable fi do so; not fi get rid a, dat is; weh mi nuh tek fi be di fact.”</p>
<p>“Gud agen. Now den, yuh no ongl waan go a-whaling, fi fain out bai eksperiens weh whaling a, bot yuh waan go fi si di worl tu? A neva dat yuh se? Mi did tingk so. Well den, jos step forward de, an tek a peep ova di weda-bow, an den bak tu mi an tel mi weh yuh si de.”</p>
<p>Fi a moment mi stan up a likkle puzzled by dis curious request, not knowing exactly how fi tek it, weda humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all him crow's feet dem inna one scowl, Captain Peleg staat mi pan di errand.</p>
<p>Wen mi go forward an glancing ova di weather bow, mi si seh di ship weh did a swing to har anchor wid di flood-tide, did a point obliquely towards di open ocean. Di prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous an forbidding; not di slightest variety weh mi coulda see.</p>
<p>“Well, weh di report?” Peleg seh wen mi come back; “weh yuh did si?”</p>
<p>“Not much,” mi reply—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, an a squall a come up, mi tink.”</p>
<p>“Well, weh yuh tink den bout si di worl? Yuh waan go roun Cape Horn fi si no more a it, eh? Yuh cyaan see di worl weh yuh stan?”</p>
<p>Mi did a likkle staggered, but go a-whaling mi haffi, an mi woulda; an di Pequod was as good a ship as any—mi did tink di bes—an all dis mi now repeat to Peleg. Wen him si mi so determined, him express him willingness fi ship mi.</p>
<p>“An yuh may as well sign di papers dem right off,” him added—“come along wid yuh.” An so seh, him lead di way below deck inna di cabin.</p>
<p>Sidong pan di transom was weh did look like a most uncommon an surprising figure. It turn out fi be Captain Bildad, who along wid Captain Peleg was one a di largest owners a di vessel; di ada shares, as is sometimes di case inna dem deh ports, being hold by a crowd a old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, an chancery wards; each owning bout di value a one timber head, or a foot a plank, or a nail or two inna di ship. People inna Nantucket invest dem money inna whaling vessels, di same way how yuh do yuh own inna approved state stocks bringing in good interest.</p>
<p>Now, Bildad, like Peleg, an indeed plenty ada Nantucketers, was a Quaker, di island having been originally settled by dat deh sect; an to dis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure di peculiarities a di Quaker, only variously an anomalously modified by tings altogether alien an heterogeneous. Fi some a dem same Quakers deh a di most sanguinary a all sailors an whale-hunters. Dem a fight Quakers; dem a Quakers wid a vengeance.</p>
<p>So dat deh have instances mong dem a man, who, name wid Scripture names—a singularly common fashion pan di island—an inna dem childhood naturally imbibing di stately dramatic thee and thou a di Quaker idiom; still, fram di audacious, daring, an boundless adventure a dem subsequent life, strangely blend wid dem unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes a character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. An wen dem ting deh unit inna a man wid greatly superior natural force, wid a globular brain an a ponderous heart; who have also by di stillness an seclusion a many long night-watches inna di remotest waters, an beath constellations weh neva see yah at di north, been lead fi tink untraditionally an independently; receiving all nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh fram har own virgin voluntary an confiding breast, an thereby chiefly, but wid some help fram accidental advantages, fi laan a bold an nervous lofty language—dat man mek one inna a whole nation's census—a mighty pageant creature, formed fi noble trage. It naa go at all detract fram him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, him have weh look like a half willful overruling morbidness at di bottom a him nature. For all man tragically great dem mek so chruu a certain morbidness. Be sure a dis, O young ambition, all mortal greatness a but disease. But, as yet wi nuh have fi do wid such a one, but wid quite anodda; an still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again fram anodda phase a di Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.</p>
<p>Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who neva care a rush fi weh dem call serious tings, an indeed did a consider dem self-same serious tings deh di veriest a all trifles—Captain Bildad neva only get educated according to di strictest sect a Nantucket Quakerism, but all him subsequent ocean life, an di sight a plenty, uncladly creatures, Hornland, all round— dat neva move dis native born Quaker one single jot, neva so much as alter one angle a him vest. Stil, fi all dis immutableness, was deh some lack a common consistency bout worthy Captain Bildad. Though him did refuse, fram conscientious scruples, fi bear arms against land invaders, yet himself did illimitably invade di Atlantic an Pacific; an though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet him did inna him straight-bodied coat, spill tons upon tuns a leviathan gore. How now inna di contemplative evening a him days, di pious Bildad reconcile dem ting deh inna di reminiscence, mi no know; but it neva look like it did concern him much, an very probably him did come to di sage an sensible conclusion lang since seh a man's religion a one ting, an dis practical world quite anodda. Dis ya worl pay dividends. Rising fram a likkle cabin-boy inna shaat clothes a di drabbest drab, to a harpooneer inna a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; fram dat becoming boat-header, chief-mate, an captain, an finally a ship owna; Bildad, as mi did hint before, did conclude him adventurous career by wholly retiring fram active life at di goodly age a sixty, an dedicating him remaining days to di quiet receiving a him well-earned income.</p>
<p>Now, Bildad, mi sorry fi seh, did have di reputation a being an incorrigible old hunks, an inna him sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. Dem tell mi inna Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, dat wen him did a sail di ole Categut whaleman, him crew, wen dem reach home, dem did mostly all carry ashore to di hospital, sore exhausted an worn out. Fi a pious man, especially fi a Quaker, him did certainly rada hard-hearted, fi seh di least. Him neva use to swear, though, at him man dem, dem seh; but somehow him get an inordinate quantity a cruel, unmitigated hard work outa dem. Wen Bildad was a chief-mate, fi have him drab-coloured eye intently looking pon yuh, mek yuh feel completely nervous, til yuh coulda clutch someting—a hammer or a marling-spike, an go a work like mad, at someting or other, neva mind weh. Indolence an idleness perish before him. Him own person was di exact embodiment a him utilitarian character. Pan him long, gaunt body, him neva carry no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, him chin have a soft, economical nap to it, like di worn nap a him broad-brimmed hat.</p>
<p>Such, den, was di person weh mi si a sidong pan di transom wen mi did a fala Captain Peleg dong inna di cabin. Di space between di decks dem did likkle; an deh, bolt-upright, did a sidong uol Bildad, weh always did a sidong so, an neva lean, an dis fi save him coat tails. Him broad-brim did put beside him; him legs dem did stiffly cross; him drab vesture did button up to him chin; an spectacles pan nose, him did look like him did absorb inna reading fram a ponderous volume.</p>
<p>“Bildad,” Captain Peleg baal out, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Yuh a study dem Scriptures deh, now, fi di laas thirty years, to mi certain knowledge. How far yuh got, Bildad?”</p>
<p>As if long habituated to such profane talk fram him old shipmate, Bildad, widout noticing him present irreverence, quietly look up, an seeing mi, glance again inquiringly towards Peleg.</p>
<p>“Im se im a fi wi man, Bildad,” Peleg se, “im waahn ship.”</p>
<p>“Yuh do?” Bildad seh, inna a hollow tone, an ton roun to mi.</p>
<p>“Mi <i>dost</i> ,” seh mi unconsciously, him was so intense a Quaker.</p>
<p>“Weh yuh tink bout him, Bildad?” Peleg seh.</p>
<p>“Im ago do,” Bildad seh, a look pan mi, an den im go aan fi spell weh at im book inna a mumbling tone weh yuh coulda audible.</p>
<p>Mi did tink him di queerest old Quaker mi eva si, especially as Peleg, him fren an old shipmate, did look such a blusterer. But mi neva seh nutten, only look roun mi sharply. Peleg now throw open a chest, an draw out di ship's articles, put pen an ink inna front a him, an sidong pan a likkle table. Mi staat tink seh a did high time fi settle wid miself at weh terms mi woulda be willing fi engage fi di voyage. Mi did already know seh inna di whaling business dem neva pay no wages; but all hands, including di captain, get certain shares a di profits weh dem call <i>lays</i> , an dat dem lays deh did proportion to di degree a importance pertaining to di respective duties a di ship's company. Mi did know seh being a green hand at whaling, mi own lay wouldn't be very large; but considering seh mi did use to di sea, coulda steer a ship, splice a rope, an all dat, mi mek no doubt seh fram all mi did hear mi shuda get offer at least di 275th lay—dat is, di 275th part a di clear net proceeds a di voyage, whatever dat might eventually amount to. An though di 275th lay was weh dem call a rather <i>long lay</i> , yet it was better dan notn; an if wi did have a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay fi di clothing mi woulda wear out pan it, not to speak a mi three years' beef an board, fi weh mi wouldn't haffi pay one stiver.</p>
<p>It might be tink seh dis was a poor way fi accumulate a princely fortune—an so it was, a very poor way indeed. But mi a one a dem weh neva tek on bout princely fortunes, an mi quite content if di worl ready fi board an lodge mi, while mi a put up at dis grim sign a di Thunder Cloud. Pan di whole, mi did tink seh di 275th lay woulda be bout di fair ting, but wouldn't been surprised if mi did get di 200th, considering mi was a broad-shouldered make.</p>
<p>But one ting, nevertheless, weh mek mi a likkle distrustful bout receiving a generous share a di profits was dis: Ashore, mi did hear someting bout both Captain Peleg an him unaccountable old crony Bildad; how dat dem being di principal proprietors a di Pequod, so di ada an more inconsiderable an scattered owners, lef nearly di whole management a di ship's affairs to dem two yah. An mi neva know but weh di stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal fi seh bout shipping hands, especially as mi now find him pan board di Pequod, quite at home deh inna di cabin, an a read him Bible as if at him own fireside. Now while Peleg did a try fi mek a pen wid him jack-knife, old Bildad, to mi no small surprise, considering seh him was such an interested party inna dem proceedings; Bildad neva lisn tu wi, bot im did a gwaan mumbl tu imself outa im buk, “ No <i>gyada</i> op chrezha pan di ort, we mout—”</p>
<p>“Well, Captain Bildad,” Peleg interrupted, “weh yuh seh, weh lay wi fi gi dis young man?”</p>
<p>“Yuh know best,” was di sepulchral reply, “di seven hundred an seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?—'where moth an rust do corrupt, but <i>lay</i> —'”</p>
<p><i>Lay</i> , indeed, did tink mi, an such a lay! di seven hundred an seventy-seventh! Well, ole Bildad, yuh decide seh mi, fi one, naa go <i>lay</i> up nuff <i>lays</i> yah dung yah, weh moth an rust do corrupt. A did a very <i>long lay</i> dat, indeed; an though fram di magnitude a di figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet di slightest consideration will show seh though seven hundred an seventy-seven a one pretty large numba, yet, wen yuh come fi mek a <i>tenth</i> a it, yuh wi den si, mi seh, seh di seven hundred an seventy-seventh part a one farthing a good deal seventy an seventy-hundred doubloons; an so mi did tink at di time.</p>
<p>“Why, blast yuh eyes, Bildad,” Peleg baal out, “yuh nuh waan swindle dis young man! him haffi have more dan dat.”</p>
<p>“Seven hundred an seventy-seventh,” Bildad seh again, widout lifting him eyes; an den go aan mumbling—“fi weh yuh treasure deh, deh deh yuh heart ago deh tu.”</p>
<p>“Mi a go put him dung fi di three hundredth,” seh Peleg, “yuh hear dat, Bildad! Di three hundredth lay, mi seh.”</p>
<p>Bildad put dung him book, an turn solemnly towards him an seh, “Captain Peleg, yuh have a generous heart; but yuh haffi consider di duty weh yuh owe to di other owners a dis ship—widows an orphans, many a dem—an dat if we too abundantly reward di labors a dis young man, wi may taking di bread fram dem widows an dem widophas or dem deh widophas or dem deh. seven hundred an seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”</p>
<p>“Yuh Bildad!” Peleg baal out, staat op an a klaat bout di kyabin. “Blast yuh, Captain Bildad, if mi did fala yuh advice inna dem ya mata, mi woulda affore now have a conscience fi lug bout weh woulda be heavy enough fi founder di largest ship weh eva sail roun Cape Horn.”</p>
<p>“Captain Peleg,” Bildad seh steadily, “yuh conscience maita a draw ten inches a waata, or ten fathoms, mi cyan tell; but as yuh still a wan impenitent man, Captain Peleg, mi greatly fear seh yuh conscience be jus a leaky one; an wi inna di end sink yuh founding dong to di Captain Peleg fier Pilet.”</p>
<p>“Fiery pit! fiery pit! yuh insult mi, man; past all natural bearing, yuh insult mi. It's an all-fired outrage fi tell any human creature seh him a goh hell. Flukes an flames! Bildad, seh dat again to mi, an staat mi soul-bolts, but mi ago—mi ago—mi ago live wid all him hair an hair horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake wid ye!”</p>
<p>As him did a thunder out dis him mek a rush at Bildad, but wid a marvelous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad fi dat time eluded him.</p>
<p>Alarmed at dis terrible outburst between di two principal an responsible owners a di ship, an feeling half a mind fi gi up all idea a sailing inna a vessel so questionably owned an temporarily commanded, mi step aside fram di door fi gi egress to Bildad, who, mi mek no doubt, did all eagerness fi vanish fram wakened before di waken a Pelegra. But to mi astonishment, him did sidong agen pan di transom very quietly, an did look like him neva have di slightest intention fi withdraw. Him did look quite used to impenitent Peleg an him ways. As fi Peleg, afta him let off him rage as him did, it did look like no more did lef inna him, an him, too, did a sit dung like a lamb, though him did a twitch a likkle as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” him whistle at last—“di squall gaan off to leeward, mi tink. Bildad, yuh use to be good at sharpen a lance, mend dat deh pen, will yuh. Mi jack-knife yah need di grindstone. Dat a him; tank yuh, Bildad. Now den, mi young man, Ishmael's name, yuh neva seh dung yah? Ishmael, fi di three hundredth lay.”</p>
<p>“Captain Peleg,” mi seh, “mi have a fren wid mi weh waan ship too—mi fi bring him dung to-morrow?”</p>
<p>“Fi be sure,” Peleg seh. “Kyari im wid yu, an wi wi luk pan im.”</p>
<p>“Weh lay him waan?” Bildad did a groan, a look up fram di book weh him did a beri himself inna again.</p>
<p>“Oh! neva mind bout dat, Bildad,” Peleg seh. “Im eva whale it any?” ton to mi.</p>
<p>“Mi kill more whales dan mi can count, Captain Peleg.”</p>
<p>“Well, bring him wid yuh den.”</p>
<p>An, afta mi sign di papers dem, mi goh; notn doubting but dat mi did do a good morning's work, an dat di Pequod was di identical ship weh Yojo did provide fi carry Queequeg an mi roun di Cape.</p>
<p>But mi neva did go far, wen mi staat fi tink seh di Captain wid whom mi did a go sail yet neva si mi; though, indeed, inna many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, an receive all har crew on board, ere di captain mek himself visible by arriving fi tek command; fi somtaim dem voyages yah so lang, an di shore intervals dem a yaad so exceedingly brief, dat if di captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment a dat deh sort, him no trouble himself much bout him ship inna port, but lef har to di owners dem til everyting ready fi sea. However, it is always as well fi have a look pon him before yuh irrevocably commit yuhself inna him han dem. Wen mi turn back mi accosted Captain Peleg, an ask weh Captain Ahab did fi find.</p>
<p>“An weh yuh waan fram Captain Ahab? It's all right enough, yuh ship.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but mi shuda like fi si him.”</p>
<p>“Bot mi no tingk yu wi kyan rait ya nou. Mi no nuo egzakli wa apm wid im, bot im stie iina di ous, laik se im sik, bot im no luk so. Im no sik, bot no, im no get beta niida. Him a one queer man, Captain Ahab—so some people tink—but a good one. Oh, yuh woulda like him well enough; wel az 'mong di kanibal; eh-yuuz fi dip wandaz dah di wievdem; fiks ih faya-faiya lans ina maitier, chrienja fier dah wail animal. Im lans! aye, di kiinest ahn di shuors dat outa aal a wi il! Aal! im a no Kaptan Bilddddddddddl; no, an im no Kaptan Peleg; <i>im a Aab</i> , bwai; an Aab a uol, yu nuo, did . a crowned king!”</p>
<p>“An a very vile one. Wen dem kill dat deh wicked king, di dog dem, dem neva lick him blood?”</p>
<p>“Come yah to mi—hither, hither,” seh Peleg, wid a significance inna him eye weh almost startled mi. “Look yuh, lad; neva seh dat pan di Pequod. Neva seh it noweh. Captain Ahab neva name himself. 'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim a him crazy, widowed mada, weh ded wen him was only a twelvemonth old. An yet di ole squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, seh dat di name woulda prove somehow prophetic, An perhaps. fools like har may tell yuh di same. A lie. Mi know Captain Ahab well; Mi know weh him is—a good man—no a pious, good man, like Bildad. jolly; an mi know seh pan di passage home, him did a likkle out a him mind fi a spell; but a did di sharp shooting pains inna him bleeding stump weh bring dat bout, as any one might see, too, dat ever since him lose him leg last voyage by dat deh accursed whale, him did a moody—but sovage all times; pass off. An once fi all, mek mi tell yuh an assure yuh, young man, it better fi sail wid a moody good captain dan a laughing bad one. dat; by dat deh sweet girl dat deh old man have a pickney: hold yuh den deh can be any utter, hopeless harm inna Ahab? No, no, mi lad stricken, blasted, if him be, Ahab have him humanities!”</p>
