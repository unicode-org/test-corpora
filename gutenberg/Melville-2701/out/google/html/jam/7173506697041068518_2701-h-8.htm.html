<p><i>Di cabin; by di stern windows; Ahab sidong im wan, an a luk out</i> .</p>
<p>Mi lef a white an turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, weh mi sail. Di envious billows sidelong swell fi whelm mi track; mek dem; but fos mi pass.</p>
<p>Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's rim, di warm waves blush like wine. Di gold brow plumb di blue. Di diver sun—slow dived fram noon—go dung; mi soul mount up! shi taiyad wid har endless hill. So, di crown too heavy fi mi wear? dis Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet it bright wid plenty a gem; Mi di wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel seh mi wear dat, dat dazzlingly confounds. 'A iron—dat mi know—no gold. 'Tis split, too—dat mi feel; di jagged edge galls mi so, mi brain look like it a beat against di solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; di sort weh need no helmet inna di most brain-battering fight!</p>
<p>Dry heat pan mi brow? Awo! time was, wen as di sunrise nobly spurred mi, so di sunset soothed. No more. Dis lovely light, it light not mi; all loveliness is anguish to mi, since mi can ne'er enjoy. Gifted wid di high perception, mi lack di low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly an most malignantly! damned inna di midst a Paradise! Good night—good night! ( <i>a wave him han, him move fram di window</i> .)</p>
<p>'A neva so hard a task. Mi did tink fi find one stubborn, at di least; but mi one cogged circle fit inna all dem various wheels, an dem revolve. Or, if yuh waan, like so many ant-hills a powder, dem all stan up infronta mi; an mi dem match. Oh, hard! dat fi fire others, di match itself mus needs be wasting! Weh mi did a dare, mi did will; an weh mi did waan, mi ago do! Dem tink mi mad—Starbuck tink; but mi a demoniac, mi a madness maddened! Dat deh wild madness weh only calm fi comprehend itself! Di praphecy was dat mi woulda be dismembered; an—Aye! Mi lost dis leg. Mi a prafit now seh mi ago dismember mi dismemberer. So, now, be di prophet an di fulfiller one. Dat a more dan yuh, yuh great gods, eva did. Mi laugh an hoot at unu, unu cricket-players, unu pugilists, unu deaf Burkes an blinded Bendigoes! Mi naa go seh as schoolboys do to bullies—Tek some one a yuh own size; no pommel <i>mi!</i> No, unu lik mi dong, an mi kom op agen; bot <i>unu</i> ron go aid. Come out fram behind yuh cotton bags! Mi have no long gun fi reach yuh. Come, Ahab's compliments to yuh; kom an si ef unu kyan swerv mi. Swerve mi? yuh cyaan swerve mi, else yuh swerve yuhself! man have yuh deh. Swerve mi? Di path to mi fixed purpose is laid wid iron rails, weh mi soul groove fi run. Ova unsounded gorges, through di rifled hearts a mountains, unda torrents' beds, unerringly mi rush! Naught's an obstacle, naught's an angle to di iron way!</p>

<p><i>By di Mainmast; Starbuck lean against it</i> .</p>
<p>Mi soul is more dan matched; she overmanned; an by a madman! Insufferable sting, dat sanity shuda ground arms pan such a field! But him drill deep dung, an blast all mi reason outa mi! Mi tink mi see him impious end; but feel seh mi haffi help him to it. Will I, nill I, di ineffable ting did tie mi to him; tows mi wid a cable mi have no knife fi cut. Horrible old man! Who deh ova him, him cry;—aye, him woulda be a democrat to all above; look, how him lord it ova all dung deh! Awo! Mi plainly see mi miserable office,—fi obey, rebelling; an worse yet, fi hate wid touch a pity! For inna him eyes mi read some lurid woe woulda shrivel mi up, if mi did it. Yet yuh have hope. Time an tide flow wide. Di hated whale have di round watery world fi swim inna, as di small gold-fish have its glassy globe. Him heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside. Mi woulda up heart, if it neva like lead. But mi whole clock run dung; mi heart di all-controlling weight, mi have no key fi lift again.</p>
<p>[ <i>A burst a revelry fram di forecastle</i> .]</p>
<p>Oh, God! fi sail wid such a heathen crew weh have likkle touch a human mothers inna dem! Whelped somewhere by di sharkish sea. Di white whale a dem demigorgon. Hark! di infernal orgies! dat deh revelry deh forward! mark di unfaltering silence aft! Mi tink it picture life. Foremost thru di sparkling sea shoots pan di gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only fi drag dark Ahab afta it, weh him broods widin him sternward cabin, build ova di dead water a di wake, an further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. Di long howl thrill mi through! Peace! unu revellers, an set di watch! Oh, life! 'tis inna an hour like dis, wid soul beat dung an held to knowledge,—as wild, untutored tings dem force fi feed—Oh, life! 'tis now dat mi do feel di latent horror inna yuh! but a nuh mi! dat deh horror deh out a mi! an wid di soft feeling a di human inna mi, yet mi ago try fi fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by mi, hold mi, bind mi, O ye blessed influences!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00046">CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.</h2>
<p>Mi, Ishmael, was one a dem crew; mi shouts dem did go up wid di rest; mi oath did welded wid dem own; an stronger mi shout, an more mi hammer an clinch mi oath, because a di dread inna mi soul. A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling did deh inna mi; Ahab's quenchless feud did look like fi mi. Wid greedy ears mi laan di history a dat deh murderous monster weh mi an all di ada dem did tek wi oaths a violence an revenge gens.</p>
<p>Fi some time past, though at intervals only, di unacompanied, secluded White Whale did haunted dem uncivilized seas mostly frequented by di Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all a dem did know bout him existence; only a few a dem, comparatively, did knowingly see him; while di numba weh as yet did actually an knowingly give battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to di large number a whale-cruisers; di disorderly way dem did a sprinkle ova di entire watery circumference, plenty a dem adventurously a push dem quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or neva fi a whole twelvemonth or more pan a stretch, fi encounter a single news-telling sail a any sort; di inordinate length a each separate voyage; di irregularity a di times a sailing fram yaad; all dem, wid ada circumstances, direct an indirect, long obstruct di spread thru di whole world-wide whaling-fleet a di special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly fi be doubted, dat several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after do great mischief to him assailants, had completely escaped dem; to some minds it neva did a unfair presumption, mi seh, dat di whale in question mus been no other dan Moby Dick. Yet as a late di Sperm Whale fishery did mark by various an not unfrequent instances a great ferocity, cunning, an malice inna di monster weh dem did attack; so it was, dat dem who by accident ignorantly give battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, fi di most part, did content fi ascribe di peculiar terror weh him bred, more, as it were, to di perils a di Sperm Whale fishery at large, dan to di individual cause. In dat deh way, mostly, di disastrous encounter between Ahab an di whale did hitherto been popularly regarded.</p>
<p>An as fi dem who, previously hearing bout di White Whale, by chance ketch sight a him; inna di beginning a di ting dem did have every one a dem, almost, as boldly an fearlessly lowered fi him, as fi any ada whale a dat deh species. But at length, such calamities did ensue inna dem assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists an ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to di last degree of fatality; dem deh repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating an piling dem terrors upon Moby Dick; dem deh ting deh did gaan far fi shake di fortitude a plenty brave hunters, to whom di story a di White Whale did eventually come.</p>
<p>Nor did wild rumors a all sorts fail fi exaggerate, an still di more horrify di true histories a dem deadly encounters. For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow outa di very body a all surprising terrible events,—as di smitten tree gi birth to its fungi; but, inna maritime life, far more dan inna dat a terra firma, wild rumors abound, weh deh deh any adequate reality fi dem cling to. An as di sea surpass di lan inna dis matter, so di whale fishery surpass every ada sort a maritime life, inna di wonderfulness an fearfulness a di rumors weh sometimes circulate deh. For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from dat ignorance an superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but a all sailors, dem a by all odds di most directly bringed into contact wid whatever is appallingly astonishing inna di sea; face to face dem no only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to dem. Alone, inna such remotest waters, dat though yuh sail a thousand miles, an pass a thousand shores, yuh wouldn't come to no chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable unda dat deh part a di sun; inna such latitudes an longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as him do, di whaleman get wrap by influences all tending fi mek him fancy pregnant wid many a mighty birth.</p>
<p>No wanda, den, dat ever gathering volume fram di mere transit ova di widest watery spaces, di outblown rumors a di White Whale did inna di end incorporate wid demself all manner a morbid hints, an half-formed fœtal suggestions a supernatural agencies, weh eventually invest Moby Dick wid new terrors weh did a appear fram anyting weh did a look like yuh did si. So dat inna nuff cases such a panic did him finally strike, dat few who by dem rumors, at least, did hear bout di White Whale, few a dem hunters deh did willing fi encounter di perils a him jaw.</p>
<p>But deh did still have ada an more vital practical influences at work. Not even at di present day have di original prestige a di Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished fram all ada species a di leviathan, dead outa di minds a di whalemen as a body. Deh deh dem dis day mongst dem, who, though intelligent an courageous enough fi offer battle to di Greenland or Right whale, woulda perhaps—either fram professional inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest wid di Sperm Whale; at any rate, deh have plenty a whalemen, especially mongst dem whaling nations weh nuh sail unda di American flag, weh neva hostilely encounter di Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge a di leviathan is restricted to di ignoble monster primitively pursued inna di North; sidong pan dem hat, dem man ya ago lisn wid a childish fireside interest an awe, tu di wild, strange tales a Southern whaling. Nor is di pre-eminent tremendousness a di great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, dan pan board a dem prows weh stem him.</p>
<p>An as if di now tested reality a him might did inna former legendary times throw it shadow before it; wi find some book naturalists—Olassen an Povelson—declaring di Sperm Whale not only fi be a consternation to every ada creature inna di sea, but also fi be so incredibly ferocious as continually fi be thirst fi human blood. Nor even dung to so late a time as Cuvier's, were dem or almost similar impressions effaced. For inna him Natural History, di Baron himself affirm seh at sight a di Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) dem “struck wid di most lively terrors,” an “often inna di precipitancy a dem flight dash demself against di rocks wid such violence as to cause instantaneous death.” An however di general experiences inna di fishery may amend such reports as dem; yet inna dem full terribleness, even to di bloodthirsty item a Povelson, di superstitious belief inna dem is, inna some vicissitudes a dem vocation, revived inna di minds a di hunters.</p>
<p>So dat overawed by di rumors an portents concerning him, not a few a di fishermen dem did memba, in reference to Moby Dick, di earlier days a di Sperm Whale fishery, wen it was oftentimes hard fi induce long practiced Right whalemen fi embark inna di perils a dis new an daring warfare; such man protesting dat although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not fi mortal man. Dat fi try it, woulda be inevitably fi get torn inna a quick eternity. Pan dis head, yu have some remarkable documents weh yuh can consult.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some deh deh, who even inna di face a dem ting deh did ready fi gi chase to Moby Dick; an a still greater numba who, chancing only fi hear bout him distantly an vaguely, widout di specific details a any certain calamity, an widout superstitious accompaniments, did sufficiently hardy fi not flee fram di battle if dem did offer dem.</p>
<p>One a di wild suggestions dem weh dem did a refer to, as at last coming fi be linked wid di White Whale inna di minds a di superstitiously inclined, was di unearthly conceit dat Moby Dick was ubiquitous; dat him did actually been encountered inna opposite latitudes at one an di same instant a time.</p>
<p>Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was dis conceit altogether widout some faint show of superstitious probability. For as di secrets a di currents inna di seas neva yet get divulged, even to di most erudite research; so di hidden ways a di Sperm Whale wen deh deh anda di surface remain, inna great part, unaccountable to him pursuers; an fram taim tu taim dem did staat di muos curious an contradictory speculations bout dem, espeshali bout di mystic modes weh, afta im did a soun tu a big depth, im did a chranspuot imself wid so big swiftnis tu di muos widely distant point dem.</p>
<p>A wan ting weh di American an English whale-ship dem nuo gud, an az wel a ting weh Scoresby did put pan authoritative record ierz ago, seh som whale dem get kech far north inna di Pacific, inna dem badi dem did fain di barbs a harpoons dem weh dem did a dart inna di Greenland seas dem. Nor is it to be gainsaid, dat in some a dem instances it have been declared dat di interval a time between di two assaults couldn't have exceeded very many days. So, by inference, it have been believed by some whalemen, dat di Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was neva a problem to di whale. So dat yah, inna di real living experience a living man, di prodigies dem did relate inna old times a di inland Strello mountain inna Portugal (near whose top deh did seh a did a lake in which di wrecks a ships did a float up to di surface); an dat still more wonderful story a di Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters dem did believe seh did come fram di Holy Land by an underground passage); dem fabulous narrations deh almost fully equaled by di realities a di whalemen.</p>
<p>Forced into familiarity, den, wid such prodigies as dem; an knowing dat afta repeated, intrepid assaults, di White Whale did escape alive; it cyaan be much matter a surprise dat some whalemen shuda go still further inna dem superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (fi immortality is but ubiquitous in time); dat though groves a spears shuda be plant inna him flanks, him woulda still swim weh unharmed; or if indeed him woulda eva be mek fi spout thick blood, such a sight woulda be only a ghastly deception; fi again inna unensanguined billows hundreds a leagues away, him unsullied jet woulda once more be seen.</p>
<p>But even stripped a dem supernatural surmisings, deh did have enough inna di earthly mek an incontestable character a di monster fi strike di imagination wid unwonted power. For, it neva so much him uncommon bulk weh so much distinguish him fram ada sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere throw out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, an a high, pyramidical white hump. Dis was him prominent features; di tokens dem weh, even inna di limitless, uncharted seas, him did a reveal him identity, at a long distance, to dem who did know him.</p>
<p>Di res a him body did so streaked, an spotted, an marbled wid di same shrouded hue, dat, inna di end, him did get him distinctive appellation a di White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by him vivid aspect, wen yuh si him a glide at high noon chruu a dark blue sea, lef a milky-way wake a creamy foam, all spangled wid golden gleamings.</p>
<p>Nor was it him unwonted magnitude, nor him remarkable hue, nor yet him deformed lower jaw, dat so much invest di whale wid natural terror, as dat unexampled, intelligent malignity weh, according to specific accounts, him did ova an ova again evinced inna him assaults. More dan all, him treacherous retreats struck more a dismay dan perhaps aught else. For, wen him did a swim before him exulting pursuers, wid every apparent symptom a alarm, him did have several times been known fi turn round suddenly, an, bearing dung upon dem, either stave dem boats to splinters, or drive dem back inna consternation to dem ship.</p>
<p>Already several fatalities did attend him chase. But though similar disasters, however likkle bruited shore, were by no means unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed di White Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, dat every dismembering or death weh him cause, neva wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.</p>
<p>Judge, den, to weh pitches a inflamed, distracted fury di minds a him more desperate hunters dem did a impelled, wen amid di chips a chewed boats, an di sinking limbs a torn comrades, dem swim outa di white curds a di whale's direful wrath inna di serene, exasperating sunlight, dat smail pan a bridal, as if at a bridal, or or bridal.</p>
<p>Him three boat dem stove roun him, an oars an man dem both a whirling inna di eddies; one captain, weh did a tek di line-knife fram him broken prow, did dash at di whale, as an Arkansas duellist at him foe, blindly seeking wid a six inch blade fi reach di fathom-deep life a di whale. Dat de captain was Ehab. An den it was, dat suddenly sweeping him sickle-shaped lower jaw unda him, Moby Dick did reap weh Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade a grass inna di field. No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, coulda have smote him wid more seeming malice. Small reason was deh fi doubt, den, dat ever since dat almost fatal encounter, Ahab did cherish a wild vindictiveness against di whale, all di more fall fi dat inna him frantic morbidness him at last come fi identify wid him, not only all him bodily woes, but all him intellectual an spiritual exasperations. Di White Whale swim before him as di monomaniac incarnation a all dem malicious agencies weh some deep man feel eating inna dem, til dem lef living on wid half a heart an half a lung. Dat deh intangible malignity weh did deh fram di beginning; to whose dominion even di modern Christians ascribe one-half a di worlds; weh di ancient Ophites dem a di east did a reverence inna dem statue devil;—Ahab neva fall dung an worship it like dem; but deliriously transferring its idea to di abhorred white whale, him pit himself, all mutilated, against it. All dat most maddens an torments; all weh stir up di lees a tings; all truth wid malice inna it; all dat crack di sinews an cake di brain; all di subtle demonisms a life an thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, did visible personified, an mek practically assailable inna Moby Dick. Im pile pan di whale's white hump di sum a all di general rage an hate weh im whole race did feel fram Adam dung; an den, as if him chest did a mortar, him burst him hot heart's shell pan it.</p>
<p>It no probably seh dis monomania inna him tek it instant rise at di precise time a him bodyly dismemberment. Den, inna di darting at di monster, knife inna him han, him did but give loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; an wen him get di stroke weh tore him, him probably but feel di agonizing bodily laceration, but notn more. Yet, wen by dis collision forced fi turn towards home, an fi long months a days an weeks, Ahab an anguish did a lay stretch tugeda inna one hammock, rounding inna mid winter dat deh dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; den it was, dat him torn body an gashed soul bled inna one anoda; an so interfusing, mek him mad. Dat a did only den, pan di homeward voyage, afta di encounter, dat di final monomania seize him, seems all but certain fram di fact dat, at intervals during di passage, him was a raving lunatic; an, though unlimbed a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked inna him Egyptian chest, an was moreover intensified by him delirium, dat him mates dem did force fi lace him fast, even deh, as him did a sail, raving inna him hammock. Inna a strait-jacket, him swing to di mad rockings a di gales. An, wen it did a run inna more sufferable latitudes, di ship, wid mild stun'sails spread, did a float across di tranquil tropics, an, to all appearances, di old man's delirium did look like him did lef bihain him wid di Cape Horn swells, an him did come outa him dark den into di blessed light an air; even den, wen him did a bore dat deh firm, collect front, however pale, an issue him calm orders once again; an him fren dem tank God seh di direful madness did gaan now; even den, Ahab, inna him hidden self, did a rave on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning an most feline ting. Wen yuh tink it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab's full lunacy neva subside, but deepeningly contracted; like di unabated Hudson, wen dat deh noble Northman flow narrowly, but unfathomably thru di Highland gorge. But, as inna him narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot a Ahab's broad madness neva lef behind; so inna dat deh broad madness, not one jot a him great natural intellect did perish. Dat before living agent, now become di living instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, him special lunacy storm him general sanity, an carry it, an turn all it concentred cannon upon it own mad mark; so dat far fram having lost him strength, Ahab, to dat one end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency dan eva him did sanely bring to bear upon any one reasonable object.</p>
<p>Dis a much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remain unhinted. But vain fi popularize profundities, an all truth is profound. Winding far dung fram widin di very heart a dis spiked Hotel de Cluny weh wi yah stan—however grand an wonderful, now quit it;—an tek yuh way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to dem vast Roman halls a Thermes; weh far beath di fantastic towers a man's upper earth, him root a grandeur, him whole awful essence sidong inna bearded state; an antique beri anda antiquities, an throned pan torsoes! So wid a broken throne, di great gods dem mock dat deh captive king; so like a Caryatid, him patient sidong, upholding pan him frozen brow di piled entablatures a ages. Wind yuh dong deh, yuh prouder, sadder souls! kweschan dat proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, him did beget unu, unu young exiled royalties; an fram yuh grim sire only di ole State-secret ago come.</p>
<p>Now, inna him heart, Ahab did have some glimpse a dis, namely: all mi means dem sane, mi motive an mi object mad. Yet widout power fi kill, or change, or shun di fact; him did know seh to mankind him did long dissemble; inna some sort, did still. But dat deh ting a him dissembling was only subject to him perceptibility, not to him will determine. Nevertheless, so well did him succeed inna dat deh dissembling, dat wen wid ivory leg him step asshore at last, no Nantucketer neva tink him otherwise dan but naturally grieved, an dat to di quick, wid di terrible casualty weh did overtake him.</p>
<p>Di report a him undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kinred cause. An so too, all di added moodiness weh always aftawards, to di very day a sailing inna di Pequod pan di present voyage, did a sidong a brooding pan him brow. Nor it is so very unlikely, dat far fram distrusting him fitness fi anodda whaling voyage, pan account a such dark symptoms, di calculating people a dat deh prudent isle did inclined fi harbor di conceit, dat fi dem very reasons him did all di better qualified an set pan edge, fi a pursuit so full a rage an wildness as di bloody hunt a whales. Gnawed widin an scorched widout, wid di infixed, unrelenting fangs a some incurable idea; such an one, could him be found, woulda seem di very man fi dart him iron an lift him lance against di most appalling a all brutes. Or, if fi any reason dem did tink fi be corporeally incapacitated fi dat, yet such an one woulda seem superlatively competent fi cheer an howl pan him underlings to di attack. But be all dis as it may, certain it is, dat wid di mad secret a him unabated rage bolt up an keyed in him, Ahab did purposely sail upon di present voyage wid di one only an all-engrossing object a hunting di White Whale. If any one a him old acquaintances dem did deh pan di shore but half did a dream bout weh did a lurk inna him den, how soon dem aghast an righteous souls woulda wrench di ship fram such a fiendish man! Dem did bent pan profitable cruises, di profit fi be count dung inna dollars fram di mint. Im did intent pan a audacious, immitigable, an supernatural revenge.</p>
<p>Yahso, den, was dis grey-headed, ungodly old man, a chase wid curses a Job's whale roun di worl, at di head a one crew, too, chiefly mek op a mongrel renegades, an castaways, an cannibals—morally enfeebled also, by di incompetence a mere unaided virtue or bucked invullity a di Starlll invullity indifference an recklessness inna Stubb, an di pervading mediocrity inna Flask. Such a crew, so officered, did look specially picked an packed by some infernal fatality fi help him to him monomaniac revenge. How it was dat dem so abundingly respond to di old man's ire—by what evil magic dem souls did possessed, dat at times him hate did look like dem; di White Whale as much dem insufferable foe as him; how all dis come to be—weh di White Whale was to dem, or how to dem unconscious understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, him mighta did look like di gliding great demon a di seas a life,—all dis fi explain, woulda be fi dive deeper dan Ishmael can go. Di subterranean miner weh work inna wi all, how one can tell weh him shaft lead by di ever shifting, muffled sound a him pick? A who nuh feel di irresistible arm drag? Weh skiff inna tow a seventy-four can stan still? Fi one, mi gi miself up to di abandonment a di time an di place; but while yet all a-rush fi encounter di whale, coulda see naught inna dat deh brute but di deadliest ill.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00047">CHAPTER 42. Di Whiteness a di Whale.</h2>
<p>Weh di white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; weh, at times, him was to mi, as yet remains unsaid.</p>
<p>Aside fram dem deh more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, weh couldn't but occasionally awaken inna any man's soul some alarm, deh did have anodda thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, weh at times by its intensity completely overpowered all di rest; an yet so mystical an well nigh ineffable was it, dat mi almost despair fi put it inna a comprehensible form. A di whiteness a di whale weh above all tings mek mi fraid. But how mi fi hope fi explain miself yah; an yet, inna some dim, random way, explain miself mi haffi, else all dem chapters deh might be naught.</p>
<p>Though inna nuff natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhance beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as inna marbles, japonicas, an pearls; an though various nations have in some way recognize a certain royal preeminence inna dis hue; even di barbaric, grand old kings a Pegu weh did a put di title “Lord of di White Elephants” above all dem ada magniloquent ascriptions a dominion; an di modern kings a Siam unfurling di same snow-white quadruped inna di royal standard; an di Hanoverian flag weh did have di one figure a one snow-white charger; an di great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to overlording Rome, having fi di imperial color di same imperial hue; an though dis pre-eminence inna it apply to di human race itself, giving di white man ideal mastership ova every dusky tribe; an though, besides, all dis, whiteness have been even mek significant of gladness, for among di Romans a white stone did mark a joyful day; an though inna ada mortal sympathies an symbolizings, dis same hue is mek di emblem a many touching, noble tings—di innocence a brides, di benignity a age; though mongst di Red Man dem a America di giving a di white belt a wampum was di deepest pledge a honor; though inna nuff climes, whiteness typify di majesty a Justice inna di ermine a di Judge, an contribute to di daily state a kings an queens weh milk-white stedes draw; though even inna di higher mysteries a di most august religions dem mek it di symbol a di divine spotlessness an power; by di Persian fire worshippers, di white forked flame being hold di holiest pan di altar; an inna di Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself did a mek incarnate inna a snow-white bull; an though to di noble Iroquois, di midwinter sacrifice a di sacred White Dog was by far di holiest festival a dem theology, dat deh spotless, faithful creature being hold di purest envoy dem coulda send to di Great Spirit wid di annual tidings a dem own fidelity; an though directly fram di Latin wod fi white, all Christian priests get di name a one part a dem sacred vesture, di alb or tunic, weh dem wear unda di cassock; an though among di holy pomps a di Romish faith, white is specially employed inna di celebration a di Passion a wi Lord; though inna di Vision a St. John, white robes dem gi to di redeemed, an di four-an-twenty elders dem stan up clothed inna white before di great white throne, an di Holy One weh sidong deh white like wool; yet fi all dem accumulated associations, wid whatever is sweet, an honorable, an sublime, deh yet lurks an elusive someting inna di innermost idea a dis hue, weh strike more a panic to di soul dan dat deh redness weh affrights inna blood.</p>
<p>Dis elusive quality it is, weh cause di thought a whiteness, wen yuh divorce fram more kindly associations, an coupled wid any object terrible in itself, fi heighten dat terror to di furthest bounds. Witness di white bear a di poles, an di white shark a di tropics; weh but dem smooth, flaky whiteness mek dem di transcendent horrors dem is? Dat ghastly whiteness it is weh imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome dan terrific, to di dumb gloating a dem aspect. So dat not di fierce-fanged tiger inna him heraldic coat can so stagger courage as di white-shrouded bear or shark.*</p>
<p>*Wid reference to di Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who woulda fain go still deeper into dis matter, dat it is not di whiteness, separately regarded, weh heighten di intolerable hideousness a dat deh brute; fi, analysed, dat heightened hideousness, it might be said, only rise fram di circumstance, dat di irresponsible ferociousness a di creature stan invested inna di fleece a celestial innocence an love; an so, by bringing tugeda two such opposite emotions inna wi minds, di Polar bear frighten wi wid so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all dis fi be true; yet, if it neva fi di whiteness, yuh wouldn't have dat intensified terror.</p>
<p>As fi di white shark, di white gliding ghostliness a repose inna dat deh creature, wen yuh beheld inna him ordinary moods, strangely tallies wid di same quality inna di Polar quadruped. Dis peculiarity is most vividly hit by di French inna di name dem bestow upon dat deh fish. Di Romish mass fi di dead staat wid “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), weh <i>Requiem</i> denominate di mass itself, an any ada funeral music. Now, in allusion to di white, silent stillness a death inna dis shark, an di mild deadliness a him habits, di French dem call him <i>Requin</i> .</p>
<p>Bethink yuh bout di albatross, weh come dem clouds a spiritual wonderment an pale dread, in which dat deh white phantom sail inna all imaginations? Not Coleridge fos throw dat deh spell; but God's great, unflattering laureate, Nature.*</p>
<p>*Mi memba di fos albatross mi eva si. A did during a prolonged gale, inna waters hard pan di Antarctic seas. Fram mi forenoon watch below, mi ascend to di overclouded deck; an deh, dashed pan di main hatches, mi si a regal, feathery ting a unspotted whiteness, an wid a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arch forth it vast archangel wings, as if fi embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings an throbbings shake it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost in supernatural distress. Thru it inexpressible, strange eyes, mi thought mi peeped to secrets weh tek hold a God. Az Abraham infronta di ienjel dem, mi bow miself; di wait ting did so wait, it wing dem so waid, an inna dem de fi eva exiled waata, mi did luuz di miserable warping memories a traditions an a towns. Lang mi did a look pan dat deh prodigy a plumage. Mi cyan tell, can only hint, di tings dem weh did a dart chruu mi den. But at last mi wake up; an turn, ask a sailor weh bird dis. A goney, him replied. Goney! neva hear dat deh name before; is it conceivable dat dis glorious ting is utterly unknown to man ashore! neva! But some time afta, mi laan seh goney was some seaman's name fi albatross. So dat by no possibility coulda Coleridge's wild Rhyme have aught fi duh wid dem mystical impressions weh did mine, wen mi si dat deh bird pan wi deck. For niida mi did read di Rhyme, nor know seh di bird a one albatross. Yet, inna seh dis, mi do but indirectly burnish a likkle brighter di noble merit a di poem an di poet.</p>
<p>Mi assert, den, dat inna di wondrous bodyly whiteness a di bird chiefly lurks di secret a di spell; a truth di more evinced inna dis, dat by a solecism a terms deh have birds weh dem call gray albatrosses; an dem mi have frequently see, but neva wid such emotions as wen mi beheld di Antarctic fowl.</p>
<p>But how di mystic ting did get kech? No bada wispa it, an mi wi tel yu; wid a treacherous hook an line, as di fowl did a float pan di sea. At last di Captain mek a postman a it; tying a lettered, leathern tally roun it neck, wid di ship's time an place; an den mek it escape. But mi no doubt, dat leathern tally, meant fi man, did tek off inna Heaven, wen di white fowl fly fi join di wing-folding, di invoking, an adoring cherubim!</p>
<p>Most famous inna wi Western annals an Indian traditions a dat a di White Steed a di Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, an wid di dignity a one thousand monarchs inna him lofty, overscorning carriage. Im was di elected Xerxes a vast herds a wild horses, whose pastures inna dem days deh did only fenced by di Rocky Mountains an di Alleghanies. At dem flaming head him westward troop it like dat deh chosen star weh every evening lead pan di hosts a light. Di flashing cascade a him mane, di curving comet a him tail, invest him wid housing more resplendent dan gold an silver-beaters coulda furnish him. A most imperial an archangelical apparition a dat deh unfallen, western world, weh to di eyes a di old trappers an hunters dem revive di glories a dem primeval times wen Adam did a walk majestic as a god, bluff-browed an fearless as dis mighty steed. Weda dem did a march mongst him aides an marshals inna di van a countless cohorts weh did a stream it ova di plains, like an Ohio; or weda wid him circumambient subjects browsing all roun at di horizon, di White Steed gallopingly review dem wid warm nostrils reddening through him cool milkiness; inna whatever aspect him did present himself, always to di bravest Indians him was di object a trembling reverence an awe. Nor it can be questioned fram weh stan pan legendary record a dis noble horse, seh a did him spiritual whiteness chiefly, weh so clothed him wid divineness; an dat dis divineness did have dat inna it weh, though commanding worship, at di same time enforce a certain nameless terror.</p>
<p>But deh deh ada instances weh dis whiteness lose all dat accessory an strange glory weh invest it inna di White Steed an Albatross.</p>
<p>Weh is it dat inna di Albino man so peculiarly repel an often shock di eye, as dat sometimes him loathed by him own kith an kin! A dat deh whiteness deh weh invest him, a ting weh di name weh him bear. Di Albino is as well made as other man—no have no substantive deformity—an yet dis mere aspect a all-pervading whiteness mek him more strangely hideous dan di ugliest abortion. Wa mek dis fi be so?</p>
<p>Nor, inna quite ada aspects, does Nature inna har least palpable but not di less malicious agencies, fail fi enlist mongst har forces dis crowning attribute a di terrible. Fram it snowy aspect, di gauntleted ghost a di Southern Seas dem did denominate di White Squall. Nor, inna some historic instances, di art a human malice omit so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heighten di effect a dat deh passage inna Froissart, wen, masked inna di snowy symbol a dem faction, di desperate White Hoods a Ghent murder dem bailiff inna di market-place!</p>
<p>Nor, inna some tings, di common, hereditary experience a all mankind fail fi bear witness to di supernaturalism a dis hue. It cyaan well be doubted, dat di one visible quality inna di aspect a di dead weh most appals di gazer, is di marble pallor weh linger deh; as if indeed dat deh pallor was as much like di badge a consternation inna di ada world, as a mortal trepidation yah. An fram dat deh pallor a di dead, wi borrow di expressive hue a di shroud weh wi wrap dem inna. Nor even inna wi superstitions wi fail fi throw di same snowy mantle roun wi phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog—Yea, while dem terrors seize wi, mek wi add, dat even di king a terrors, wen personified by di evangelist, ride pan him pallid horse.</p>
<p>So, inna him ada moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious ting him will by whiteness, no man can deny seh inna its profoundest idealized significance it call up a peculiar apparition to di soul.</p>
<p>But though widout dissent dis point be fixed, how mortal man fi account fi it? Fi analyze it, woulda seem impossible. Wi can, den, by di citation a some a dem instances deh weh dis ting a whiteness—though fi di time either wholly or in great part stripped a all direct associations calculated fi impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless, is found fi exert ova wi di same sorcery, however modified;—can we thus hope fi light pan some clunce fi conducte di hidden wi seek?</p>
<p>Mek wi try. But inna a matter like dis, subtlety appeal to subtlety, an widout imagination no man can follow anodda one inna dem ya hall. An though, doubtless, some at least a di imaginative impressions bout fi be present may have been shared by most man, yet few perhaps was entirely conscious of dem at di time, an therefore may not be able fi recall dem now.</p>
<p>Why to di man a untored ideality, who happen fi be but loosely acquainted wid di peculiar character a di day, do di bare mention a Whitsuntide marshal inna di fancy such long, dreary, speechless processions a slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast an hooded wid new-fallen snow? Or, to di unread, unsophisticated Protestant a di Middle American States, why di passing mention a one White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue inna di soul?</p>
<p>Or weh deh deh apart fram di traditions a dungeoned warriors an kings (we naa go wholly account fi it) weh mek di White Tower a London tell so much more strongly pan di imagination a one untravelled American, dan dem deh ada storied structures, its neighbors—di Byward Tower, or even di Bloody? An dem sublimer towers deh, di White Mountains a New Hampshire, weh, inna peculiar moods, come dat deh gigantic ghostliness ova di soul at di bare mention a dat deh name, while di thought a Virginia's Blue Ridge is full a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective a all latitudes an longitudes, di name a di White Sea exert such a spectralness ova di fancy, while dat a di Yellow Sea lulls wi wid mortal thoughts a long lacquered mild afternoons pan di waves, followed by di gaudiest an yet sleepiest a sunsets? Or, fi choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to di fancy, why, in reading di old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “di tall pale man” a di Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through di green a di groves—why is dis phantom more terrible dan all di whoroping imburg imburg imburg?</p>
<p>Nor it is, altogether, di remembrance a har cathedral-toppling earthquakes; nor di stampedoes a har frantic seas; nor di tearlessness a arid skies weh neva rain; nor di sight a har wide field a leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, an crosses all adroop (like canted yards a anchored fleets); an har suburban avenues a house-walls weh did a lay ova pan each ada, as a tossed pack a cards;—a nuh dem ting deh alone mek tearless Lima, di strangest, saddest city weh yuh can't see. For Lima tek di white veil; an deh deh a higher horror inna dis whiteness a har woe. Old as Pizarro, dis whiteness keep har ruins fi ever new; admit not di cheerful greenness a complete decay; spread ova har broken ramparts di rigid pallor a one apoplexy weh fix it own distortions.</p>
<p>Mi know seh, to di common apprehension, dis phenomenon a whiteness no confessed fi be di prime agent inna exaggerating di terror a objects otherwise terrible; nor to di unimaginative mind is deh aught a terror inna dem appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consist inna dis one phenomenon, especially wen exhibited unda any form at all approaching to muteness or universality. Weh mi mean by dem two statement yah may perhaps be respectively elucidated by di following examples.</p>
<p>Fos: Di mariner, wen him a draw nigh di coasts a foreign lans, if by night him hear di roar a breakers, staat fi vigilance, an feel jus enough a trepidation fi sharpen all him faculties; but anda precisely similar circumstances, mek dem call him fram him hammock fi view him ship a sail thru a midnight sea a milky whiteness—as if fram encircling headlands shoals a combed white bears did a swim roun him, den him feel a silent, superstitious dread; di shrouded phantom a di whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain di lead assure him seh him still off soundings; heart an helm dem both go dung; him neva rest til blue wata deh unda him again. Yet weh di mariner deh weh ago tell yuh, “Sir, it neva so much di fear fi hit hidden rocks, as di fear a dat deh hideous whiteness weh so stir mi?”</p>
<p>Sekant: Tu di native Indian a Peru, di kantinyual sight a di snow-howdahed Andes convey nought a dread, except, perhaps, inna di mere fancying a di eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, an di natural conceit a how a fearfulness it woulda be fi lose yuhself inna such inhuman solitudes. Much di same ting is it wid di backwoodsman a di West, who wid comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted wid driven snow, no shadow a tree or twig fi break di fixed trance a whiteness. Not so di sailor, beholding di scenery a di Antarctic seas; weh at times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain inna di powers a frost an air, him, shivering an half shipwrecked, instead a rainbows speaking hope an solace to him misery, views weh look like a boundless churchyard grinning upon him wid its lean ice monuments an splintered crosses.</p>
<p>But yuh seh, mi tink seh white-lead chapter bout whiteness a jus a white flag weh did a hang out fram a craven soul; yuh surrender to a hypo, Ishmael.</p>
<p>Tell mi, why dis strong young colt, foaled inna some peaceful valley a Vermont, far remove fram all beast a prey—why it is dat upon di sunniest day, if yuh but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so dat him cyaan even see it, but only smell it wild animal muskiness—why him ago staat sort, burn, an pasting inna di ground eyes phrensies of affright? No remembrance inna him a no gorings a wild creatures inna him green northern yaad, so dat di strange muskiness weh him smell cyaan recall to him notn weh did associate wid di experience a former perils; fi weh him know, dis New England colt, bout di black bisons dem a distant Oregon?</p>
<p>No: but yahso yuh si even inna a dumb brute, di instinct a di knowledge a di demonism inna di worl. Though thousands a miles fram Oregon, still wen him smell dat deh savage musk, di rending, goring bison herds dem deh as to di deserted wild foal a di prairies, weh dis instant dem may be a trampling into dust.</p>
<p>So, den, di muffled rollings a one milky sea; di bleak rustlings a di festooned frosts a mountains; di desolate shiftings a di windrowed snows a prairies; all dem, to Ishmael, a like di shaking a dat deh buffalo robe to di frightened colt!</p>
<p>Aalduo non a dem no nuo weh di niemles tingz dem weh di mystic sign gi dem so hint de; yet wid mi, as wid di colt, someweh dem deh ting deh haffi deh deh. Though inna nuff a it aspects dis visible world look like it did form inna love, di invisible spheres dem did form inna fright.</p>
<p>But not yet we have solve di incantation a dis whiteness, an learn why it appeal wid such power to di soul; an more strange an far more portentous—why, as wi have seen, it is at once di most meaning symbol a spiritual tings, nay, di very veil a di Christian's Deity; an yet shuda be as it is, di intensifying agent in tings di most appalling to mankind.</p>
<p>A dat by it indefiniteness it shadow forth di heartless voids an immensities a di universe, an so stab wi fram behind wid di thought a annihilation, wen wi beholding di white depths a di milky way? Or is it, dat as in essence whiteness a nuh so much a color as di visible absence a colour; an at di same time di concrete a all colours; a fi dem reasons yah dat deh deh such a dumb blankness, full a meaning, inna a wide landscape a snows—a colourless, all-colour a atheism weh we shrink fram? An wen wi consider dat deh ada theory a di natural philosophers, dat all ada earthly hues—every stately or lovely emblazoning—di sweet tinges a sunset skies an woods; yea, an di gilded velvets a butterflies, an di butterfly cheeks a young girls; all dem deh a jus subtile deceits, not actually inherent inna substances, but only laid on fram outside; so dat all deified Nature absolutely paint like di harlot, whose allurements cover nutten but di charnel-house widin; an wen wi proceed further, an consider seh di mystical cosmetic weh produce every one a har hues, di great principle a light, fi eva remain white or colorless inna itself, an if it operating widout medium upon matter, woulda touch all objects, even tulips an roses, wid it own blank tinge—pondering all dis, di palsied universe lies before wi a leper; an like wilful travelers inna Lapland, who refuse fi wear colored an coloring glasses pan dem eyes, so di wretched infidel gazes himself blind at di monumental white shroud weh wrap all di prospect roun him. An a all dem ting deh di Albino whale was di symbol. Yuh wanda den bout di fiery hunt?</p>
