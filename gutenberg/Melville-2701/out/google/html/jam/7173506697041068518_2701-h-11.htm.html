<h2 id="pgepubid00058">CHAPTER 53. Di Gam.</h2>
<p>Di ostensible reason why Ahab neva go pan di whaler weh wi did taak bout was dis: di wind an sea did a betoken storms. But even if dis neva did di case, him wouldn't afta all, perhaps, have boarded har—judging by him subsequent conduct pan similar occasions—if so it did been dat, by di process a hailing, him did get a negative ansa to di kweschan him did put. For, as it eventually turn out, him neva care fi consort, even fi five minutes, wid any stranger captain, except him coulda contribute some a dat deh information weh him so absorbingly did a look fah. But all dis might remain inadequately estimated, if someting neva seh yah bout di peculiar usages a whaling-vessels wen dem meet each other inna foreign seas, an especially pan a common cruising-ground.</p>
<p>If two strangers a cross di Pine Barrens inna New York State, or di equally desolate Salisbury Plain inna England; if casually encounter each other in such inhospitable wilds, dem twoin yah, fi di life a dem, cyaan well avoid a mutual salutation; an stop fi a moment fi interchange di news; an, perhaps, sitting dung fi a while an resting in concert: den, how much more natural dat upon di illimitable Pine Barrens an Salisbury Plains a di sea, two whaling vessels a decrying each other at di ends a di earth—off lone Fanning's Island, or di far away King's Mills; how much more natural, mi seh, dat unda such circumstances dem ships yah shudn't only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly an sociable contact. An especially dis woulda seem to be a matter of course, inna di case a vessels weh own inna one seaport, an whose captains, officers, an not a few a di man dem personally know to each other; an consequently, have all sorts a dear domestic tings fi talk bout.</p>
<p>Fi di long absent ship, di outward-bounder, perhaps, have letters pan board; at any rate, she wi be sure fi mek har have some papers a date a year or two later dan di last one pan har blurred an thumb-worn files. An in return fi dat courtesy, di outward-bound ship woulda receive di latest whaling intelligence fram di cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a ting of the utmost important to har. An in degree, all dis ago hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other's track pan di cruising-ground itself, even though dem equally long absent fram home. Fi one a dem maita get a transfer a leta fram some third, an now far remote vessel; an some a dem letta deh maita be fi di people dem pan di ship weh she meet now. Besides, dem woulda exchange di whaling news, an have an agreeable chat. For not only dem woulda meet wid all di sympathies a sailors, but likewise wid all di peculiar congenialities arising fram a common pursuit an mutually shared privations an perils.</p>
<p>Nor woulda difference of country mek any very essential difference; dat is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is di case wid Americans an English. Though, fi be sure, fram di likl nomba a English whalers, such meetings no very often occur, an wen dem do occur deh too apt fi be a sort a shyness between dem; fi yuh Englishman is rather reserved, an yuh Yankee, him nuh fancy dat deh sort a ting inna nobody but himself. Besides, di English whalers dem sometimes affect a kind a metropolitan superiority ova di American whalers dem; regarding di long, lean Nantucketer, wid him nondescript provincialisms, as a sort a sea-peasant. But weh dis superiority inna di English whalemen dem really consist, it woulda be hard fi seh, seeing dat di Yankees dem inna one day, collectively, kill more whales dan all di English, collectively, inna ten years. But dis a one harmless likkle foible inna di English whale-hunters, weh di Nantucketer dem nuh tek much to heart; probably, cause him know seh him have a few foibles himself.</p>
<p>So, den, wi si seh a all ships separately weh a sail di sea, di whalers dem have most reason fi be sociable—an dem so. Whereas, some merchant ships crossing each other's wake inna di mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on widout so much as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway; an all di time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon each other's rig. As fi Men-of-War, wen dem chance fi meet at sea, dem first go chruu such a string a silly bowings an scrapings, such a ducking a ensigns, dat it nuh look like yuh have much right-down hearty good-will an brotherly love bout it at all. As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, dem deh inna such a prodigious hurry, dem run weh fram each ada as soon as possible. An as fi Pirates, wen dem chance fi cross each ada cross-bones, di first hail is—“How many skulls?”—di same way how whalers hail—“How many barrels?” An dat deh kweschan once ansa, pirates straightway steer apart, cause dem a infernal villains pan both sides, an dem nuh like fi see overmuch a each other villanous likenesses.</p>
<p>But look pon di godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable, free-an-easy whaler! Weh di whaler do wen she meet anodda whaler inna any sort a decent weather? Shi have a “ <i>Gam</i> ,” a ting so utterly unknown to all other ships dat dem neva hear bout di name even; an if by chance dem shuda hear bout it, dem only grin at it, an repeat gamesome stuff bout “spouters” an “blubber-boilers,” an such like pretty exclamations. Why it is dat all Merchant-seamen, an also all Pirates an Man-of-War's man, an Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; dis a one kweschan it woulda be hard fi ansa. Bikaaz, inna di case a pirates, seh, mi shuda like fi know weda dat de profession a dem have any peculiar glory bout it. It sometimes end inna uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at di gallows. An besides, wen a man get elevate inna dat deh odd fashion, him nuh have no proper foundation fi him superior altitude. So, mi conclude, seh inna boasting himself fi be high lifted above a whaleman, inna dat deh assertion di pirate nuh have no solid basis fi stan pan.</p>
<p>But weh a <i>Gam?</i> Yuh might wear out yuh index-finger running up an dung di columns a dictionaries, an neva find di word. Dr. Johnson neva attain to dat deh erudition; Noah Webster's ark nuh hold it. Nevertheless, dis same expressive word now fi nuff years been inna constant use mongst some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it need a definition, an it shuda be incorporate inna di Lexicon. Wid dat deh view, mek mi learnedly define it.</p>
<p>GAM. NOUN— <i>A social meeting a two</i> ( <i>or more</i> ) <i>Whaleships, generally pan a cruising-ground; wen, afta dem exchange hails, dem exchange visits by boats' crews: di two captains remaining, fi di time, pan board a one ship, an di two chief mates pan di ada one.</i></p>
<p>Deh have anodda likkle ting bout Gamming weh yuh no fi forget yah. All professions have dem own likkle peculiarities of detail; so di whale fishery. Inna a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, wen di captain get row anyweh inna him boat, him always sidong inna di stern sheets pan a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat deh, an often steer himself wid a pretty likkle milliner's tiller weh dem decorate wid gay cords an ribbons. But di whale-boat nuh have no seat astern, no sofa a dat deh sort whatever, an no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains did a wheel bout di water pan castors like gouty old aldermen inna patent chairs. An as fi a tiller, di whale-boat neva admit a any such effeminacy; an so as inna gamming a complete boat's crew haffi lef di ship, an hence as di boat steerer or harpooneer is a di numba, dat deh subordinate a di steersman upon di occasion, an di captain, having no place fi sit inna, is pull off to him visit all standing like a pine tree. An often yuh wi notice seh being conscious a di eyes a di whole visible world resting pan him fram di sides a di two ships, dis standing captain is all alive to di importance a sustaining him dignity by maintaining him legs. Nor dis a nuh very easy matter; fi inna him rear a di immense projecting steering oar weh a hit him now an den inna di small a him back, di afta-oar a reciprocate by rapping him knees inna front. Im so completely wedged before an behind, an can only expand imself sideways by settle dung pan im stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch a di boat will often go far fi topple him, cause length a foundation a nutten widout corresponding breadth. Merely mek a spread angle a two poles, an yuh cyaan stan dem up. Den, again, it woulda neva do inna plain sight a di world's riveted eyes, it woulda neva do, mi seh, fi dis straddling captain fi be seen steadying himself di slightest particle by catching hold a anyting wid him hands; indeed, as token a him entire, buoyant self-command, him generally carry him hands inna him trowsers' pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy hands, him carry dem deh fi ballast. Nevertheless deh have occurred instances, well authenticated ones too, weh di captain have been known fi an uncommonly critical moment or two, inna a sudden squall say—fi seize hold a di nearest oarsman's hair, an hold on deh like grim death.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00059">CHAPTER 54. Di Town-Ho's Story.</h2>
<p>( <i>As told at di Golden Inn.</i> )</p>
<p>Di Cape a Good Hope, an all di watery region roun deh, is much like some noted four corner a one great highway, weh yuh meet more travelers dan inna any ada part.</p>
<p>It neva tek lang afta dem did a taak di Goney dat dem did miit wan neda homeward-bound whaleman, di Town-Ho,*. Shi did manned almost wholly by Polynesians. Inna di short gam weh did happen she gi wi strong news a Moby Dick. Tu some di general interest inna di White Whale did now wildly heightened by a circumstance a di Town-Ho's story, weh did look obscurely fi involve wid di whale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation a one a dem so called judgments of God weh at times dem seh fi overtake some man. Dis latter circumstance, wid it own particular accompaniments, forming weh may be called di secret part a di tragedy bout fi be narrated, neva reach di ears a Captain Ahab or him mates. Fi dat deh secret part a di story neva know to di captain a di Town-Ho himself. A did di private property a three confederate white seamen a dat deh ship, one a dem, it look like, did communicate it to Tashtego wid Romish injunctions of secrecy, but di neks night Tashtego ramble inna him sleep, an reveal so much a it inna dat deh way, dat wen him did wake him couldn't well withhold di rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did dis ting did have pan dem seamen inna di Pequod weh did come to di full knowledge a it, an by such a strange delicacy, fi call it so, dem did a govern inna dis matter, dat dem did keep di secret mongst demself so dat it neva transpire abaft di Pequod's main-mast. Interweaving inna it proper place dis darker thread wid di story as publicly narrated pan di ship, di whole a dis strange affair mi now proceed fi put pan lasting record.</p>
<p>*Di ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale fram di mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting di famous Gallipagos terrapin.</p>
<p>Fi mi humor's sake, mi ago preserve di style in which mi once narrate it at Lima, to a lounging circle a mi Spanish fren dem, one saint's eve, a smoke pan di thick-gilt tiled piazza a di Golden Inn. Outa dem fine cavaliers deh, di young Dons, Pedro an Sebastian, did deh pan di closer terms wid mi; an hence di interluding questions dem occasionally put, an weh dem duly ansa at di time.</p>
<p>“Some two years prior to mi first learning di events weh mi a bout rehearsal to yuh, gentlemen, di Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, did a cruise inna yuh Pacific yah, not very many days' sail eastward fram di eaves a dis good Golden Inn. Shi did deh somwe to di northward a di Line one maanin upon di usage, according to daily handling it. dem did observe seh she did a mek more water inna har hold dan common. Dem did suppose a sword-fish did stab har, gentlemen. But di captain, having some unusual reason fi believe seh rare good luck did a wait him inna dem deh latitudes deh, an therefore being very averse fi quit dem, an di leak neva did consider dangerous at all, though dem couldn't find it low inna di hold; dong as was possible inna rather heavy weather, di ship still did a work at di pumps at wide an easy intervals; but no good luck did come by, an not only was di leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. islands, deh fi have him hull hove out an repair.</p>
<p>“Though no likkle passage did deh before har, yet, if di commonest chance did favour, him neva at all fear seh him ship woulda found by di way, cause him pumps dem did a di bes, an being periodically relieved at dem, dem six-an-thirty man a him coulda easily keep di ship free; neva mind if di leak shuda double pan har truth, inna di truth being attended a dis passage. by very prosperous breezes, di Town-Ho did all but certainly arrive inna perfect safety at har port widout di occurrence a di least fatality, if it neva been fi di brutal overbearing a Radney, di mate, a Vineyarder, an di bitterly provoked vengeance a Steelkilt, a Lakeman an desperado fram Buffalo.</p>
<p>“'Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, weh a Lakeman, an weh Buffalo deh?' Don Sebastian seh, a rise inna him swinging mat a grass.</p>
<p>“Pan di eastern shore a fi wi Lake Erie, Don; but—mi crave yuh courtesy—may be, yuh shall soon hear further a all dat. Now, gentlemen, inna square-sail brigs an three-masted ships, well-nigh as large an stout as any weh eva sail outa yuh ole Callao to far Manilla, dis Lake, inna di heart a wi America, did yet; been nurtured by all dem agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected wid di open ocean. For inna dem interflowing aggregate, dem grand fresh-water seas a ours,—Erie, an Ontario, an Huron, an Superior, an Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, wid plenty a di ocean's rat a varieties a traits; dem have round archipelagoes a romantic isles, even as di Polynesian waters do inna large part, dem shored by two great contrasting nations, as di Atlantic is; Mackinaw; dem did hear di fleet thunderings a naval victories at intervals, dem yield dem beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out dem peltry wigwams; wild Afric beasts of prey, an silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors, dem mirror di paved capitals a Buffalo an Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages dem float alike di full-rigged merchant ship, di armed cruiser a di State, di steamer, an di beoma dem weh dem can get disweat; blasts as direful as any dat lash di salted wave; dem know weh shipwrecks is, for out of land, however inland, dem have drown full a midnight ship wid all its shrieking crew. So, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-nocean as much of any anner; Radney, though inna him infancy him maita did lay him dung pan di lone Nantucket beach, fi nurse at him maternal sea; though inna afta life him did a follow wi austere Atlantic an yuh contemplative Pacific yet him did quite as vengeful an full a social quarrel as di backwoods seaman, fresh fram di latitudes a buck-hand-leves weh did deh inna dis Yenick; Nantucketer a one man wid some good-hearted traits; doomed an mek mad, an Steelkilt—but, gentlemen, yuh ago hear.</p>
<p>“It neva more dan a day or two at di furthest afta shi did a point har prow fi har island haven, dat di Town-Ho's leak did a look like it did a increase again, but only so as it did a require an hour or more at di pumps every day. Yuh haffi know seh inna a settled an civilized ocean like wi Atlantic, fi example, some skippers tink a pomp likkle whole way across it, though a night, still a night. di officer a di deck happen fi forget him duty inna dat deh respect, di probability woulda be seh him an him shipmates woulda neva again remember it, pan account a all hands gently subsiding to di bottom Nor inna di solitary an savage seas far fram yuh to di westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual fi ships fi keep dem clanging at pump-hand in a full a voyage. considerable length; dat is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded dem A only wen a leaky vessel deh inna some very out a di way part a dem deh waters, some really landless latitude, dat har captain staat feel a likkle anxious.</p>
<p>“Much dis way it did been wid di Town-Ho; so wen dem did find har leak gaining once more, deh did in truth some likkle concern manifested by several a har company; especially by Radney di mate. Him command di upper sails fi be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, an every way expand to di breeze. Now dis Radney, mi suppose, was as likkle coclined to any a likkle sort a nervous apprehensiveness touching him own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea weh yuh can conveniently imagine, gentlemen So wen him betray dis solicitude bout di safety a di ship, some a di seamen dem declare seh a did only on account a him being a part owna inna har. So even wen dem did a work pan dis pumps, dem did a work pan dis small. gamesomeness slily going on mongst dem, as dem did a stan up wid dem foot dem continually overflow by di rippling clear water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen—dat bubbling fram di pumps dem did a run across di deck, an did a pour itself out inna steady spouts at di lee scupper-holes.</p>
<p>“Now, as yuh well know, it no seldom di case inna dis conventional worl a wi—watery or otherwise; dat wen a person weh get place inna command ova him fellow-men find one a dem fi be very significantly him superior inna general pride a manhood, straightway against dat deh man him conceive an unconquerable dislike an bitterness; an if him have a chance pull down an pull down dat deh subternal tower, an mek a likkle heap a dust a it. Be dis conceit a mi as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall an noble animal wid a head like a Roman, an a flowing golden beard like di tasseled housings a yuh last viceroy's snorting charger an a brain, an a heart, an a heart, weh did mek Steelkilt; Charlemagne, if him did born son to Charlemagne's fadda. But Radney, di mate, did ugly as a mule yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious Him neva love Steelkilt, an Steelkilt did know it.</p>
<p>“Espying di mate drawing near as him did a toiling at di pump wid di rest, di Lakeman affected not fi notice him, but unawed, go on wid him gay banterings.</p>
<p>“'Aye, aye, mi merry lads, it's a lively leak dis; hold a cannikin, one a unu, an mek wi have a taste. By di Lord, it's worth bottling! Mi tell unu weh, man, old Rad's investment haffi go fi it! him did bes cut weh him part a di hull an tow it home. Di fact, dat boys, is only began di sword. job; him come back again wid a gang a ship-carpenters, saw-fish, an what not; him a one simple old soul,—Rad, an a beauty too.'</p>
<p>“'Damn yuh eyes! weh dat deh pump a stop fah?' Radney baal out, a gwaan laik se im neva ier di sailors dem taak 'Thunder away at it!'</p>
<p>“'Aye, aye, sir,' seh Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. 'Lively, boys, lively, now!' An wid dat di pump did a clang like fifty fire-engines;</p>
<p>“Quitting di pump at last, wid di rest a him band, di Lakeman go forward all panting, an sidong pan di windlass; him face fiery red, him eyes bloodshot, an a wipe di profuse sweat fram him brow. Now weh cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, dat possessed Radney fi meddle wid such a man inna corporeally state dat mi know, not; but so it happen. Intolerably striding along di deck, di mate command him fi get a broom an sweep dung di planks, an also a shovel, an tek weh some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig fi run at large.</p>
<p>“Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea a one piece a household work weh in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening; it have been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in sea some who would not some some; willingly drown widout first washing dem face. But in all vessels dis broom business is di prescriptive province of di boys, if boys deh deh aboard Besides, it was di stronger man dem inna di Town-Ho weh did get divided inna gangs, tek turns at di pumps dem, an being di most athletic seaman a dem all, Steel did get regularly assigned di gangs; shuda did get free fram any trivial business weh neva connect wid truly nautical duties, such being di case wid him comrades Mi mention all dem particulars yah so yuh may understand exactly how dis affair did stan between di two man dem.</p>
<p>“But deh did have more dan dis: di order bout di shovel did almost as plainly meant fi sting an insult Steelkilt, as if Radney did spat inna him face. Any man weh did go sailor inna a whale-ship will understand dis; an all dis an doubtless much more, di Lakeman did fully comprehended wen di mate seh him command but as him did stil saaf fi a moment, as him did stie saaf fi a moment. look inna di mate malignant eye an perceived di stacks a powder-casks heap up inna him an di slow-match silently burning along towards dem as him instinctively si all dis, dat strange forbearance an unwillingness fi stir up di deeper passionateness inna any already ireful being—a felt most, even validant by men; aggrieved—dis nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stele ova Steelkilt.</p>
<p>“So, inna him ordinary tone, only a likkle broken by di bodily exhaustion weh him did a temporarily inna, him ansa him seh dat sweeping di deck a neva him business, an him wouldn't do it. An den, widout at all alluding to di shovel, him point to three lads as di customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at di pumps, neva do nutten to dis day. Radney replied wid an oath, inna a most domineering an outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating him command meanwhile advancing upon di still seated Lakeman, wid a uplifted cooper's club hammer weh him did snatch fram a cask near by.</p>
<p>“Heated an irritated as him did deh by him spasmodic toil at di pumps, fi all him first nameless feeling a forbearance di sweating Steelkilt coulda but ill brook dis bearing inna di mate; but somehow still smothering di conflagration widin him, widout speaking him did remain doggedly rooted to him seat, till at di hammered shooked widin a few inches a him face, furiously commanding him fi do him bidding.</p>
<p>“Steelkilt rose, an slowly retreating round di windlass, steadily followed by di mate wid him menacing hammer, deliberately repeated him intention fi nuh obey. Seeing, however, dat him forbearance neva have di slightest effect, by an awful an unspeakable intimation wid him twisted han him warned an did no foolish inna di man; purpose. An inna dis way di two a dem go once slowly roun di windlass;</p>
<p>“'Mr. Radney, mi naa go obey yuh. Tek weh dat deh hammer, or look to yuhself.' But di predestinated mate weh did a come still closer to him, weh di Lakeman did a stan up fix, now did a shake di heavy hammer widin a inch a him teet dem meanwhile repeating a string a insufferable maledictions Retreating not di thousandth part a one inch stab him inna di eye wid di unflinching a him right han; behind him an creepingly drawing it back, tell him persecutor dat if di hammer but graze him cheek him (Steelkilt) woulda murder him. But, gentlemen, di fool did get brand fi di slaughter by di gods Immediately di hammer did a touch di cheek di next instant di lower a di jaw did a fall pan him headwhuting;</p>
<p>“Ere di cry coulda go aft Steelkilt did a shake one a di backstays dem weh did a lead far aloft to weh two a him comrades did a stan dem mastheads. Dem was both Canallers.</p>
<p>“'Canallers!' Don Pedro baal out 'Wi si plenty whale-ship dem inna wi harbours, but neva ier bout yuh Canallers Pardon: who an weh dem is.'</p>
<p>“'Canallers, Don, a di boatmen dem weh belong to wi grand Erie Canal. Yuh mosi did hear bout it.'</p>
<p>“'Nay, Senor; hereabouts inna dis dull, warm, most lazy, an hereditary lan, wi know but likkle a yuh vigorous North.'</p>
<p>“'Aye? Well den, Don, refill mi cup. Yuh chicha very fine; an ere proceeding further mi ago tell yuh weh wi Canallers dem is; fi such information may throw side-light pan mi story.'</p>
<p>“Fi three hundred an sixty miles, gentlemen, thru di entire breadth a di state a New York; thru numerous populous cities an most thriving villages; thru long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, an affluent, cultivated fields, unrivaled fi fertility; by biliard-room an bar-room thru di greatest Romanholies; arches ova Indian rivers; by happy hearts or broken; ever find dem, next door to yuh;</p>
<p>“'A dat a friar passing?' seh Don Pedro, looking dung inna di crowded plazza, wid humorous concern.</p>
<p>“'Well fi wi northern fren, Dame Isabella's Inquisition wanes inna Lima,' Don Sebastian laugh. 'Proceed, Senor.'</p>
<p>“'A moment! Pardon!' wan neda wan a di kompini baal out. 'Ina di niem a aal a wi Limeese, mi jos waahn expres tu yu, sailor, se wi no uovaluk yu delikacy fi no tek we Lima we de faar faar ina yu korop komparishan; yu no bada bow an luk sopraiz; It but bears out yuh saying, too; So, tu, Venice; mi did deh deh; di holy city a di blessed evangelist, St. Mark, purge it!</p>
<p>“Freely depicted inna him own vocation, gentlemen, di Canaller woulda mek a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly an picturesquely wicked is him. Like Mark Antony, fi days an days along him green-turfed, flowery Nile, him indolently float, openly toying wid him red-cheeked Cle trapa, a ripe upon him thigh sun deck. But shore, all dis effeminacy is dashed. Di brigandish guise weh di Canaller so proudly sports; turn fram one a dem Canallers yah; mi woulda no be ungrateful; but it is often one a di prime redeeming qualities a yuh man of violence, dat at times him have as stiff an arm fi back a poor stranger inna a strait, as fi plunder a rich one. wild whale-fishery contain so much a it most finished graduates, an dat scarce any race a mankind, except Sydney man, are so much distrusted by wi whaling captains Nor does it at all diminish di curiousness a dis matter, dat to many thousands a wi rural boys an young man dem weh born along it line, di probaary life a di furnition a di Grand canle so quiet. reaping inna a Christian corn-field, an recklessly plowing di waters a di most barbaric seas.</p>
<p>“ 'Mi si! Mi si!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling him chicha upon him silvery ruffles. 'No need fi travel!</p>
<p>“Mi lef off, gentlemen, weh di Lakeman did a shake di backstay. Hardly did him did do so, wen him did surrounded by di three junior mates an di four harpooneers, who all crowd him to di deck. But sliding dung di ropes like baleful comets, di two Canallers dem rush inna di uproar, an did a try drag dem man outa it fi di Others castle fi di Others. sailors jain wid dem inna dis attempt, an a twisted turmoil ensue; wile im did a stan out a harm's way, di valiant captain dance up an dung wid a whale-pike, calling upon im officers fi manhandle dat deh atrocious scoundrel, an smoke him along to di quarter-deck. heart a it wid him pike, did a try fi prick out di object a him resentment. But Steelkilt an him desperadoes dem did too much fi dem all;</p>
<p>“'Come out a dat, unu pirates!' roar di captain, now menacing dem wid a pistol inna each han, jus bring to him by di steward 'Come out a dat, ye cut-throats!'</p>
<p>“Steelkilt leap pan di baricade, an stride up an dung deh, defied di worst di pistols dem coulda do; but gi di captain fi andastan distinctly, seh him (Steelkilt's) death woulda be di signal fi a murderous mutiny pan di part a all hands. Fearing inna him heart lest dis might prove but too true, di captain did still defed a likkle surgent, but dem still dead inna di surgent dem instantly fi return to dem duty.</p>
<p>“'Yuh wi promise yuh naa go touch wi, if wi do?' demand dem ringleader.</p>
<p>“'Turn to! turn to!—Mi mek no promise;—to yuh duty! Yuh waan sink di ship, by knocking off at a time like dis? Turn to!' an him once more raise a pistol.</p>
<p>“'Sink di ship?' Steelkilt baal out. 'Aye, mek har sink. No man a wi turn to, unless yuh swear seh yuh naa go raise a rope-yarn gens wi. turn to him comrades. A fierce cheer was dem response.</p>
<p>“Di Lakeman now did a patrol di baricade, all di while a keep him eye pan di Captain, an a jerking out such sentences as dem yah:—'A nuh fi wi fault; wi neva waan it; mi tell him fi tek weh him hammer; a did bwoy's business; him mighta did know mi before dis; mi tell him not fi prick di buffalo finger mi did break a jaw gens him jaw; ain't dem mincing knives deh inna di forecastle, by God, look to yuhself; forget it all;</p>
<p>“'Torn tu! Mi no mek no pramis, ton tu, mi se!'</p>
<p>“'Look yuh, now,' di Lakeman baal out, a fling out im arm tuwaadz im, 'a fyuu a wi de ya (an mi a wan a dem) we ship fi di kruuz, d'ye see; nou az yu wel nuo, sa, wi kyan klaim wi dischaaj az suun az di ankra dong; so wi no waahn no row; redi fi wok, bot dem naa go biit wi.’</p>
<p>“'Turn to!' di Captain roar.</p>
<p>“Steelkilt glance roun him a moment, an den seh:—'Mi tell yuh weh it is now, Captain, radda dan kill yuh, an get hung fi such a shabby rascal, wi naa go lift a han gens yuh unless yuh attack wi; but til yuh seh di wod bout no flogging wi, wi naa go do a hand's turn.'</p>
<p>“'Down inna di forecastle den, dung wid yuh, mi ago keep yuh deh til yuh sick a it. Down yuh go.'</p>
<p>“'Wi fi?' di ringliida baal out tu im man dem.</p>
<p>“As di Lakeman's bare head did jus level wid di planks, di Captain an him posse leap di baricade, an rapidly draw ova di slide a di scuttle, plant dem group a han dem pan it, an loudly call fi di steward fi bring di heavy brass padlock weh did belong to di companionway. Den dem open di slide a likkle bit, an close someting di Captain, whisper dung di crack it, an turn di key pan dem—ten inna numba—lef pan deck some twenty or more, who so far did remain neutral.</p>
<p>“All nait a wide-awake watch did kip by all di officers, forward an aft, especially bout di forecastle scuttle an fore hatchway; at which last place it did feared di insurgents might come out, afta dem break thru di bulkhead below. But di hours a darkness pass in peace; di man dem weh still did a stay at dem duty fi pump an clin, who clanking at intervals through di dreary night dismally resounded thru di ship.</p>
<p>“At sunrise di Captain go forward, an knock pan di deck, summon di prisoners fi work; but wid a yell dem refuse. Water den did lower dung to dem, an a couple handfuls a biscuit did toss afta it; wen again turn di key pan dem an pocket it, di Captain go back to di quarter-wide fi three days. repeated; but pan di fourth maanin a confused wrangling, an den a scuffling did hear, as di customary summons did deliver; Emboldened by dis, di Captain reiterate him demand to di rest, but Steelkilt shout up to him a terrific hint fi stop him babbling an betake himself weh him belong pan di fifth morning three others a di mutineers dem bolt up inna di air fram di desperate arms dem below weh did a try restrain dem Only three did lef.</p>
<p>“'Better turn to, now?' di Captain seh wid a heartless jeer.</p>
<p>“'Shut wi up again, yuh will!' Steelkilt baal out.</p>
<p>“'Oh certainly,' di Captain seh, an di key click.</p>
<p>“A did at dis point, gentlemen, weh did enraged by di defection a seven a him former associates, an stung by di mocking voice weh did last hail him, an maddened by him long entombment inna a place as black as di bowels a despair; summoning a di garrison; an armed wid dem keen mincing knives (long, crescent, heavy implements wid a handle at each end) run amuck fram di bowsprit to di taffrail; scheme met wid no opposition pan di part a di ada two; dem did swer seh dem did ready fi dat, or fi any ada mad ting, fi anyting inna short but a surrender. An weh did more, dem each insist pan being di first man pan deck, wen di time fi mek di rush shuda come But to dis dem leader as fiercely objected, reserving dat himself as not fi yield di two; ada, inna di matter; an both a dem couldn't be first, fi di ladder woulda but admit one man at a time. An yahso, gentlemen, di foul play a dem miscreants yah haffi come out.</p>
<p>“Wen dem hear di frantic project a dem leader, each inna dem own separate soul did suddenly light, it woulda seem, upon di same piece a treachery, namely: fi be foremost inna breaking out, in order fi be di first a di three, though di last a di ten, fi surrender; an thereby secure whatever small pardonnce But wen Stenkil did know him conduct. determination still fi lead dem to di last, dem inna some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mix dem before secret treachries tugeda;</p>
<p>“Thinking murder at hand, an smelling inna di dark fi di blood, him an all him armed mates an harpooneers rush fi di forecastle. Inna a few minutes di scuttle did open, an, bound hand an foot, di still struggling ringleader did get shove up inna di air by him perfidious allies, who once claim di honor a one man weh did full ripe murder. But all dem did a collar, an dem did a drag dem along di deck like dead cattle; an, side by side, dem did a heng up inna di mizzen rigging, like three quarters a meat, an dem did a hang til morning, 'Damn ye,' di Captain did a baal out, a pacing to an fro infronta dem, 'di vultures wouldn't ye!</p>
<p>“At sunrise him summon all hans; an separate dem weh did rebel fram dem weh neva tek part inna di mutiny, him tell di fos one seh him have a good mind fi flog dem all round—tingk, pan di whole, him woulda do so—im oughta—justice demand it; but fi di present, considering dem timely surrere, him woulda go wid a repriming administered inna di vernacular.</p>
<p>“'But as fi unu, unu carrion rogues,' turning to di three man dem inna di rigging—'fi unu, mi mean fi mince unu up fi di try-pots;' an, sizing a rope, him apply it wid all him power to di backs a di two traitors, til dem yell no more, but lifelessly hang dem head sideways, as di two crucified thieves dem get draw.</p>
<p>“'Mi wrist sprain wid yuh!' him baal out, at last;</p>
<p>“Fi a moment di exhausted mutineer mek a tremulous motion a him cramped jaws, an den painfully twisting roun him head, seh inna a sort a hiss, 'Weh mi a seh a dis—an mind it well—if yuh flog mi, mi murder yuh!'</p>
<p>“'Yu se so? den si ou yu fraitn mi'—an di Kaptan jraa we wid di rop fi lik.</p>
<p>“'Best not,' di Lakeman hissed.</p>
<p>“'But mi haffi,'—an di rope did once more drawn back fi di stroke.</p>
<p>“Steelkilt yah hiss out someting, inaudible to all but di Captain; who, to di amazement a all hands, staat back, pace di deck rapidly two or three times, an den suddenly throw dung him rope, seh, 'Mi naa go do it—let him go—cut him dung: d'ye hear?'</p>
<p>“But as di junior mates dem did a hurry fi execute di order, a pale man, wid a bandaged head, arrest dem—Radney di chief mate. Ever since di blow, him did lay inna him berth; but dat deh maanin, wen him did hear di tumult pan di deck, him did crept out, an so far him did a watch di whole scene, so dat him coulda speak hardly; mumbling someting bout <i>him</i> being willing an able fi do weh di captain neva did a try, him snatch di rope an advance to him pinioned foe.</p>
<p>“'Yuh a coward!' di Lakeman hiss.</p>
<p>“'So mi deh, but tek dat.' Di mate did inna di very act a striking, wen anodda hiss stay him uplifted arm. Him pause: an den pausing no more, mek good him word, spite a Steelkilt's threat, whatever dat mighta been Di three man dem did den cut dung, all han dem did turn to, an, sullenly worked by di momendy, di clanged pumps before.</p>
<p>“Jos afta nait dat deh day, wen one watch did retire below, a clamor did hear inna di forecastle; an di two trembling traitors dem did a run up, besiege di cabin door, an seh dem neva did a consort wid di crew. Entreaties, cuffs, an kicks couldn't drive dem back, so at dem own instance dem did put dem dung inna di ship's runs fi still, no sain of salvation. reappear mongst di rest. On di contrary, it did look like, dat mainly at Steelkilt's instigation, dem did resolve fi maintain di strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to di last, an, wen di ship reach port, desert har inna a body Bot fi mek sure di speediest, dem did agree to all notn—name notn els. sing out fi whales, in case any shuda be discovered. For, spite a har leak, an spite a all har ada perils, di Town-Ho still maintain har mast-heads, an har captain did jus as willing fi lower fi a fish dat deh moment, an pan di day him craft first strike di cruising ground, an Radney di mate did quite read fi change him mout an beat wid a beat; seek fi gag inna death di vital jaw a di whale.</p>
<p>“But though di Lakeman did induce di seamen dem fi adopt dis sort a passiveness inna dem conduct, him did keep him own counsel (at least til all did ova) concerning him own proper an private revenge upon di man weh did stung him inna di ventricles a him heart. Him did deh inna Radney di chief mate's watch; an as if di infatuated man did a look fi run more dan afta him doom di scene at di rigging, him insist, against di express counsel a di captain, upon resume di head a him watch at night Upon dis, an one or two ada circumstances, Steelkilt systematically build di plan a him revenge.</p>
<p>“Durin di nait, Radney did have a unseamanlike way fi sidong pan di bulwarks a di quarter-deck, an did a lean him arm pan di gunwale a di boat weh did a hoist up deh, a likkle above di ship's side. Inna dis attitude, it did well known, him sometimes did a doze. Deh did have a considerable vacancy between di seat an di boat, an di down was between di sea. Steelkilt calculate him time, an find out seh him next trick at di helm woulda come round at two o'clock, inna di morning a di third day fram dat in which him did get betray At him leisure, him employ di interval fi braiding someting very carefully inna him watches dung deh.</p>
<p>“'Weh yuh a mek deh?' seh a shipmate.</p>
<p>“'Wa unu tingk, ou it luk?'</p>
<p>“'Like a lanyard fi yuh bag; but it's an odd one, seems to mi.'</p>
<p>“'Yes, rather oddish,' seh di Lakeman, holding it at arm's length before him; 'but mi tink it ago ansa. Shipmate, mi nuh have enough twine,—yuh have any?'</p>
<p>“But nobadi neva deh inna di forecastle.</p>
<p>“'Den mi haffi get some fram old Rad;' an him get up fi go aft.</p>
<p>“‘Yu no miin fi go beg tu <i>im!</i> ’ wan sailor se.</p>
<p>“'Why not? Yuh tink him naa go do mi a turn, wen it's fi help himself inna di end, shipmate?' an go to di mate, him look pan him quietly, an ask him fi some twine fi rend him hammock. Dem did gi him—neither twine or lanyard neva see again; him trick at di silent helm—nigh to di man weh did apt fi doze ova di grave always ready dug to di seaman's hand—dat fatal hour was den to come;</p>
<p>“Bot, jentlman, wan fuul siev di wan we wuda kil im fram di blodi sitn we im did plan fi du. Yet im did av kompliit rivenj, an widout di avenger. Kaaz bai wan mistiek fataliti, Hevn itself did luk laik se it did a step iin fi tek outa im an dem iina it uona di damn ting we im wuda du.</p>
<p>“It was jus between daybreak an sunrise a di morning a di secan day, wen dem did a wash dung di decks, dat a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water inna di main-chains, all at once shout out, 'Dere she roll! deh she roll!' Jesu, what a whale! A did Moby Dick.</p>
<p>“'Moby Dick!' Don Sebastian baal out; 'St. Dominic!</p>
<p>“'A very white, an famous, an most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but dat woulda be too long a story.'</p>
<p>“'How? how?' all di young Spaniards dem did a crowd, crowding.</p>
<p>“'Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! Mi cyan rehearse dat now. Mek mi get more inna di air, Sirs.'</p>
<p>“'Di chicha! di chicha!' Don Pedro baal out 'wi vigorous fren look faint;—fill up him empty glass!'</p>
<p>“No need, gentlemen; one moment, an mi proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving di snowy whale widin fifty yards a di ship—forgetful a di compact mongst di crew—inna di excitement a di moment, di Teneriffe man did instinctively an involuntarily lift him voice fi di time though it did been plainhelt fi some time fram di three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy 'Di White Whale—di White Whale!' a di cry fram captain, mates, an harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumors, did all anxious fi capture so famous an precious a fish while di dogged crew did a look askance, an wid curses, di appalling beauty a di vast milky mass, weh did a lait op by a horizontal spangling sun, did a glide like a blue living inna di morning; sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervade di whole career a dem events yah, as if verily mapped out before di world itself did get charted. Di mutineer was di bowsman a di mate, an wen him did a fast to a fish, it was him duty fi sit next him, while Radney did a stan op wid him lance inna di prow, an haul inna di more, wen di fourword, wen him did a goh. di boat dem did get dung, an nobadi neva howl more fiercely wid delight dan Steelkilt, as him did a strain at him oar Afta a stiff pull, dem harpooneer get fast, an, spear inna him hand, Radney did a sprang to di bow. topmost back. Nothing loath, him bowsman haul him up an up, through a blinding foam weh blent two whitenesses tugeda til a sudden di boat strike as against a sunken ledge, an keeling ova, spill out di standing mate Dat instant, as him did a fall pan di whale's slippery back, di bowsman did a swell a wile. tossed ova inna di sea, pan di ada flank a di whale. Him strike out thru di spray, an, fi a moment, did a dimly see himself fram di eye a Moby Dick But di whale rush roun inna a sudden maelstrom, an go up up wid him jaws; dung.</p>
<p>“Meantime, at di fos tap a di boat's bottom, di Lakeman did slack di line, so as fi drop astern fram di whirlpool; calmly looking on, him did tink him own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking a di boat, quickly bring him knife to di line. Him cut it an di free at some distance. rose again, wid some tatters a Radney's red woolen shirt, ketch inna di teet dem weh did destroy him All four boat dem gi chase again;</p>
<p>“Ina gud taim, di Town-Ho reach har port—a savage, solitary place—weh no civilized creature neva deh deh. Deh, headed by di Lakeman, all but five or six a di foremastmen dem deliberately deserted mongst di palms; eventually, as it turn out, seize a big double war-canoe a di savage, setting an some ada harbor.</p>
<p>“Di ship's company weh did a reduce to but a handful, di captain call pan di Islanders fi assist him inna di laborious business a heaving dung di ship fi stop di leak. But to such unresting vigilance ova dem dangerous allies was necessitated dis small band a whites, both by night an by day, an so extreme was di hard work dem did a goh do, dat dem did ready inna demself again a weakned condition weh di captain neva put off wid dem inna so heavy a vessel. Afta him tek council wid him officers, him anchor di ship as far off shore as possible loaded an run out him two cannon dem pan di bows; whale-boat, steer straight before di wind fi Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, fi procure a reinforcement to him crew.</p>
<p>“Pan di fourth day a di sail, dem did describe a big canoe, weh did look like it did toch a low isle a corals. Him did a steer weh fram it; but di savage craft did a bear dung pan him; an soon di voice a Steelkilt hail him fi heave to, or him woulda run him unda water. Di captain gi him a foot pan each foot a di pistol. war-canoes, di Lakeman laugh him to scorn; assuring him seh if di pistol so much as click inna di lock, him woulda bury him inna bubbles an foam.</p>
<p>“ 'Wa unu waahn fram mi?' di captain baal out.</p>
<p>“‘Weh paat dem lak unu op fa, an a wa dem lak unu op fa?’ Steelkilt demand 'no lies.'</p>
<p>“'Mi a go a Tahiti fi more man.'</p>
<p>“'Very good. Mek mi board yuh a moment—mi come inna peace.' Wid dat him leap fram di canoe, swim to di boat; an climb di gunwale, stan up face to face wid di captain.</p>
<p>“'Cross yuh arms, sir; throw back yuh head. Now, repeat afta mi. As soon as Steelkilt lef mi, mi swear fi beach dis boat pan yonder island, an stay deh fi six days. If mi no do, may lightnings strike mi!'</p>
<p>“'A pretty scholar,' di Lakeman laugh. 'Adios, Senor!' an jump inna di sea, him swim back to him comrades.</p>
<p>“Watchin di boat til it did fairly beach, an drawn up to di roots a di cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt mek sail agen, an inna di rait taim arrive a Tahiti, im own place a destination. Deh, luck befriend him; two ships did bout fi sail fi France, an dem did providentially in need a numba a dat deh head or dem did sail. embarked; an so fi eva get di staat a dem former captain, if him did at all mind fi work dem legal retribution.</p>
<p>“Some ten days afta di French ships dem did sail, di whale-boat did arrive, an di captain did force fi enlist some a di more civilized Tahitians, who did somewhat used to di sea. Chartering a likkle native schooner, him go back wid dem to him vessel; an wen him find all right deh, again resume him cruisings.</p>
<p>“We Steelkilt deh now, gentlemen, nobadi nuh know; but pan di island a Nantucket, di widow a Radney still turn to di sea weh refuse fi gi up its dead; still inna dreams she see di owful white whale weh destroy him. * * * *</p>
<p>“'Yuh don?' Don Sebastian seh, quietly.</p>
<p>“'Mi a, Don.'</p>
<p>“'Den mi a beg yuh, tell mi if to di bes a yuh own convictions, dis yuh story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did yuh get it fram an unquestionable source? Bear wid mi if mi seem fi press.'</p>
<p>“'Also bear wid all a wi, sir sailor; fi wi all join inna Don Sebastian's suit,' di company did a baal out, wid exceeding interest.</p>
<p>“'Is deh deh a copy a di Holy Evangelists inna di Golden Inn, gentlemen?'</p>
<p>“'Nay,' seh Don Sebastian; 'but mi know a worthy priest near by, who will quickly procure one fi mi. Mi go fi it; but yuh well advised? dis may grow too serious.'</p>
<p>“'Yuh wi so gud fi bring di priest tu, Don?'</p>
