<h2 id="pgepubid00038">CHAPTER 33. Di Specksnyder.</h2>
<p>Concerning di officers a di whale-craft, dis seems as good a place as any fi set dung a likkle domestic peculiarity pan ship-board, arising fram di existence a di harpooneer class a officers, a class unknown of course in any other marine dan di whale-fleet.</p>
<p>Di big importance weh did deh pan di harpooneer's vocation is evinced by di fact, dat originally inna di old Dutch Fishery, two centuries an more ago, di command a one whale ship neva wholly lodged inna di person weh dem call di captain now, but dem did divide between him an one officer weh dem call di Specksnyder. Literally dis word mean Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time mek it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. Inna dem deh days deh, di captain's authority did restrict to di navigation an general management a di vessel; while ova di whale-hunting department an all dem concerns, di Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reign supreme. Inna di British Greenland Fishery, anda di corrupted title a Specksioneer, dis uol Dutch official still deh, but him former dignity sadly abridged. At present him rank simply as senior Harpooneer; an as such, is only one a di captain's more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon di good conduct a di harpooneers di success a one whaling voyage largely depends, an since inna di American Fishery him a nuh only an important officer inna di boat, but unda certain circumstances (night watches pan a whaling ground) di command a di ship's deck is also him; so di grand political maxim a di sea demands, seh him fi nominally live apart fram di man dem before di mast, an be in some way distinguished as dem professional superior; though always, by dem, familiarly regarded as dem social equal.</p>
<p>Now, di grand distinction weh mek between officer an man at sea, a dis—di first lives aft, di last forward. So, inna whale-ships an merchantmen alike, di mates dem have dem quarters wid di captain; an so, too, inna most a di American whalers di harpooneers dem lodge inna di afta part a di ship. Dat mean, dem tek dem meal inna di captain's cabin, an sleep inna a place weh indirectly communicate wid it.</p>
<p>Though di long period a Southern whaling voyage (by far di longest a all voyages now or eva mek by man), di peculiar perils a it, an di community a interest weh did a prevail mongst a company, all a dem, high or low, depend fi dem profits, not pan fixed wages, but pan dem common luck, tugeda wid dem common vince, an haad work; though all dem ting deh do inna some cases tend fi beget a less rigorous discipline dan inna merchantmen generally; yet, neva mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family dem whalemen yah may, inna some primitive instances, live tugeda; fi all dat, di punctilious externals, at least, a di quarter-deck dem seldom materially relaxed, an in no instance done weh. Indeed, plenty a di Nantucket ships dem in which yuh wi si di skipper a parade him quarter-deck wid an elated grandeur weh nuh surpass inna no military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if him did a wear di imperial purple, an not di shabbiest a pilot-cloth.</p>
<p>An though a all man di moody captain a di Pequod was di least given to dat deh sort a shallowest assumption; an though di only homage him eva exact, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though him neva require no man fi tek weh di shoes dem fram him foot dem before him step pan di quarter-deck; an though deh did have times wen, owing to peculiar circumstances connected wid events hereafter to be detailed, him did a address dem inna unusual terms, weda a condescension or <i>in terrorem</i> , or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.</p>
<p>Nor, perhaps, it will fail fi be eventually perceived, dat behind dem deh forms an usages, as it were, him sometimes mask himself; incidentally mek use a dem fi ada an more private ends dan dem did legitimately intended fi subserve. Dat certain sultanism a him brain, weh did adawise inna a good degree did remain unmanifested; thru dem deh form deh dat same sultanism did become incarnate inna one irresistible dictatorship. Fi be a man's intellectual superiority weh it will, it can neva assume di practical, available supremacy ova other man, widout di aid a some sort a external arts an entrenchments, always, inna demself, more or less paltry an base. Dis it is, dat fi eva keep God's true princes of di Empire fram di world's hustings; an lef di highest honors weh dis air can gi, to dem man deh weh become famous more chruu dem infinite inferiority to di choice hidden handful a di Divine Inert, dan chruu dem undoubted superiority ova di dead level a di mass. Such big virtue lurks inna dem small tings yah wen extreme political superstitions invest dem, dat inna some royal instances even to idiot imbecility dem have imparted potency. But wen, as inna di case a Nicholas di Czar, di ringed crown a geographical empire encircle an imperial brain; den, di plebeian herds dem crouch abased before di tremendous centralization. Nor, di tragic dramatist weh woulda depict mortal indomitableness inna it fullest sweep an direct swing, eva forget a hint, incidentally so important inna him art, as di one now alluded to.</p>
<p>But Ahab, mi Captain, still a move before mi inna all him Nantucket grimness an shagginess; an inna dis episode touching Emperors an Kings, mi nuh fi conceal seh mi only have fi do wid a poor old whale-hunter like him; an, so, all outward majestical trappings an housings dem denied mi. Oh, Ahab! weh ago be grand inna yuh, it haffi be plucked at fram di skies, an dive fi inna di deep, an featured inna di unbodied air!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00039">CHAPTER 34. Di Cabin-Table.</h2>
<p>A noon; an Dough-Boy, di steward, thrusting him pale loaf-of-bread face fram di cabin-scuttle, announce dinner to him lord an master; who, sitting inna di lee quarter-boat, jus a tek an observation a di sun; an a now mutely reckoning di latitude pan di smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved fi dat daily purpose pan di upper part a him ivory leg. Fram him complete inatention to di tidings, yuh woulda tink seh moody Ahab neva hear him menial. But presently, catching hold a di mizen shrouds, him swing himself to di deck, an inna one even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,” disappear inna di cabin.</p>
<p>Wen di laas echo a him sultan step ded weh, an Starbuck, di fos Emir, have every reason fi suppose seh him sidong, den Starbuck rouses fram him quietude, tek a few turns along di planks, an, afta a grave peep inna di binnacle, seh, wid some touch a pleasantness, “Dinner, descends, an di scuttles. Di secan Emir lounge bout di rigging awhile, an den slightly shake di main brace, fi si if it ago be all right wid dat deh important rope, him likewise tek up di old burden, an wid a rapid “Dinner, Mr. Flask,” follow afta him predecessors.</p>
<p>But di third Emir, now seeing himself all alone pan di quarter-deck, seems him feel relieved fram some curious restraint; fi, tipping all sorts a knowing winks inna all sorts a directions, an kicking off him shoes, him strike inna a sharp but noiseless squall a hornpipe right ova di Grand Turk's head; an den, by a dexterous sleight, pitching him cap up inna di mizentop fi a shelf, him go dung rollicking so far at least as him remain visible fram di deck, reversing all other processions, by bringing up di rear wid music. But ere step inna di cabin doorway below, him pause, ship a new face altogether, an, den, independent, hilarious likkle Flask enter King Ahab's presence, inna di character a Abjectus, or di Slave.</p>
<p>A no di least among di strange tings dem weh di intense artificialness a sea-usages bred, dat while inna di open air a di deck some officers will, upon provocation, bear demself boldly an defyingly enough towards dem commander; yet, ten to one, mek dem very officers deh di next moment go dung to dem customary dinner inna dat deh same commander's cabin, an straightway dem inoffensive, not to seh deprecatory an humble air towards him, as him sit at di head a di table; dis a marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wa mek dis difference? A problem? Miebi no. Fi be Belshazar, King a Babylon; an fi be Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly mus been some touch of mundane grandeur. But him who inna di rightly regal an intelligent spirit preside ova him own private dinner-table a invited guests, dat deh man's unchallenged power an dominion a individual influence fi di time; dat deh man royalty a state transcend Belshazzar's, fi Belshazzar neva di greatest. Who has but once dine him fren dem, don taste weh it is fi be Cæsar. A wan witchery a social czarship weh nobadi kyaahn stan op. Now, if to dis consideration yuh superadd di official supremacy a one ship-master, den, by inference, yuh wi derive di cause a dat deh peculiarity a sea-life weh mi jus mention.</p>
<p>Ova him ivory-inlaid table, Ahab did a president like a mute, maned sea-lion pan di white coral beach, surrounded by him warlike but still deferential cubs. Inna him own proper turn, each officer did a wait fi get served. Dem did like likkle pickney before Ahab; an yet, inna Ahab, it did look like it neva lurk di smallest social arrogance. Wid one mind, dem intent eyes all fastened pan di old man's knife, as him did a carve di chief dish before him. Mi no suppose seh fi di worl dem woulda profane dat deh moment wid di slightest observation, even pan so neutral a topic as di weather. No! An wen him reach out him knife an fork, between which di slice a beef did lock, Ahab thereby motion Starbuck's plate towards him, di mate get him meat as if him did a get alms; an cut it tenderly; an a likkle staat if, perchance, di knife graze gens di plate; an chew it noiselessly; an swallow it, not widout circumspection. For, like di Coronation banquet at Frankfort, weh di German Emperor profoundly dines wid di seven Imperial Electors, so dem cabin meals deh was somehow solemn meals, eaten inna awful silence; an yet at table old Ahab neva forbid conversation; only him himself did dumb. Wat a relief it was fi choking Stubb, wen a rat mek a sudden racket inna di hold below. An poor likkle Flask, him was di youngest son, an likkle bwoy a dis weary family party. Him dem was di shinbones a di saline beef; him woulda been di drumsticks. Fi Flask did presumed fi help himself, dis mosi did look like him did a larceny inna di first degree. If him did help himself at dat deh table, doubtless, neva more him woulda been able fi hold him head up inna dis honest world; nevertheless, strange fi seh, Ahab neva forbid him. An if Flask did help himself, di chances dem did deh fi Ahab neva so much as notice it. Least a all, did Flask presume fi help himself fi butter. Weda him did tink di owna dem a di ship did deny it to him, pan account a it clotting him clear, sunny complexion; or weda him did tink seh, pan so long a voyage inna such marketless waters, butter did deh at a premium, an so it neva fi him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!</p>
<p>Wan neks ting. Flask was di last person dung a di dinner, an Flask a di first man up. Cansida! For hereby Flask's dinner did badly jammed inna point a time. Starbuck an Stubb both did have di staat a him; an yet dem also have di privilege fi lounging inna di rear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher dan Flask, happen fi have but a likkle appetite, an soon show symptoms a concluding him repast, den Flask haffi bestir himself, him naa go get more dan three mouthfuls dat deh day; fi it is against holy usage fi Stubb fi precede Flask to di deck. So it was dat Flask once admit in private, dat ever since him did arisen to di dignity a one officer, fram dat deh moment him neva know weh it was fi be otherwise dan hungry, more or less. For weh him did nyam neva so much relieve him hunger, as keep it immortal inna him. Piis an satisfakshan, Flask did tingk, don lef mi beli fi eva. Mi a one officer; but, how mi wish mi coulda fish a bit a old-fashioned beef inna di forecastle, as mi used to wen mi did deh before di mast. Deh deh di fruits a promotion now; deh deh di vanity a glory: deh deh di insanity a life! Besides, if it was so dat any mere sailor of di Pequod did have a grudge against Flask inna Flask's official capacity, all dat sailor did haffi do, fi get ample vengeance, was fi go aft at dinner-time, an get a peep at Flask thru di cabin sky-light, sitting silly an dumfoundered before Ahabhabh.</p>
<p>Now, Ahab an him three mates form weh dem can call di first table inna di Pequod's cabin. Afta dem lef, tek place inna inverted order to dem arrival, di canvas cloth did clear, or rather did restore to some hurried order by di pallid steward. An den di three harpooneers dem did get bidden fi di feast, dem a it residuary legatees. Dem mek a sort a temporary servants' hall a di high an mighty cabin.</p>
<p>In strange contrast to di hardly tolerable constraint an nameless invisible domineerings a di captain's table, was di entire care-free license an ease, di almost frantic democracy a dem inferior fellows di harpooneers. While dem masters, di mates, did a look fraid a di sound a di hinges a dem own jaws, di harpooneers dem did a chew dem food wid such a relish dat deh did a report to it. Dem did a dine like lords; dem ful op dem beli laik Indian ship aal die a luod wid spais. Such portentous appetites did have Queequeg an Tashtego, dat fi fill out di vacancies dem weh did mek by di previous repast, often di pale Dough-Boy did fain fi bring on a great baron a salt-junk, seemingly quarried outa di solid ox. An if him neva lively bout it, if him neva go wid a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, den Tashtego did have a ungentlemanly way fi accelerate him by darting a fork at him back, harpoon-wise. An once Daggoo, seized wid a sudden humor, assist Dough-Boy's memory by snatching him up bodily, an thrusting him head inna a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife inna him han, staat lay out di circle preliminary fi scalping him. Im was naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort a likkle fellow, dis bread-faced steward; di progeny a one bankrupt baker an a hospital nurse. An weh wid di standing spectacle a di black terrific Ahab, an di periodical tumultuous visitations a dem three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, afta him si di harpooneers dem furnished wid all tings dem demand, him woulda escape fram dem clutches into him likkle pantry adjoining, an fearfully peep out at dem through di blinds a it door, til all did ova.</p>
<p>A did a sight fi si Queequeg a sidong uova gens Tashtego, a oppose im filed teet dem tu di Indian dem: crosswise tu dem, Daggoo a sidong pan di floor, fi a bench wuda bring im hearse-plumed head tu di low carlines; at every motion a him colossal limbs, mek di low cabin framework fi shake, as wen an African elephant go passenger inna a ship. But fi all dis, di great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to seh dainty. It did look hardly possible dat by such comparatively small mouthfuls him coulda keep up di vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, an superb a person. But, doubtless, dis noble savage fed strong an drink deep a di abunding element a air; an chruu him dilated nostrils snuffed inna di sublime life a di worlds. Not by beef or by bread, are giants mek or nourished. But Queequeg, him did have a mortal, barbaric smack a di lip inna eating—an ugly sound enough—so much so, dat di trembling Dough-Boy almost look fi see weda any marks a teet did lurk inna him own lean arms. An wen him did a hear Tashtego a sing out fi him fi produce himself, dat him bones dem coulda pick, di simple-witted steward all but shatter di crockery weh did a hang roun him inna di pantry, by him sudden fits a di palsy. Nor did di whetstone weh di harpooneers dem did a carry inna dem pocket, fi dem lances an other weapons; an wid which whetstones, at dinner, dem woulda ostentatiously sharpen dem knives; dat deh grating sound neva at all tend fi tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How him coulda forget seh inna him Island days, Queequeg, fi one, mus certainly did guilty a some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares di white waiter weh wait pan cannibals. No napkin him fi carry pan him arm, but a buckler. Inna good time, though, to him great delight, di three salt-sea warriors woulda rise an depart; to him credulous, fable-mongering ears, all dem martial bones jingling inna dem at every step, like Moorish scimetars inna scabbards.</p>
<p>But, though dem barbarians deh dine inna di cabin, an dem did a live deh; still, being anyting but sedentary inna dem habits, dem did scarcely ever inna it except at mealtimes, an jus before sleeping-time, wen dem pass thru it to dem own peculiar quarters.</p>
<p>Inna dis one matter, Ahab did look no exception to most American whale captains, who, as a set, rather incline to di opinion dat by rights di ship's cabin belong to dem; an dat a by courtesy alone dat anybody else is, at any time, permitted deh. So dat, in real truth, di mates an harpooneers a di Pequod might more properly seh dem did live outa di cabin dan inna it. Kaaz wen dem did a go iin de, it did luk laik wan striit-duor we go iina wan ous; ton inwards fi a moment, only fi be turn out di next; an, as a permanent ting, residing inna di open air. Nor dem neva lose much hereby; inna di cabin neva have no companionship; socially, Ahab neva accessible. Though nominally included inna di census a Christendom, him did still an alien to it. Im did live inna di worl, as di last a di Grisly Bears dem did live inna settled Missouri. An as wen Spring an Summer did lef, dat deh wild Logan a di woods, weh did a beri himself inna di hollow a one tree, did a live out di winta deh, a suck him own paws; so, inna him inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul, shut up inna di caved trunk a him body, deh feed upon di sullen paws a it gloom!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00040">CHAPTER 35. Di Mast-Head.</h2>
<p>A did during di more pleasant weather, dat inna due rotation wid di ada seamen dem mi first mast-head come round.</p>
<p>Inna most American whalemen di mast-heads dem manned almost simultaneously wid di vessel dem a lef har port; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles, an more, fi sail ere reaching har proper cruising ground. An if, afta a three, four, or five years' voyage she a draw nier home wid anyting empty inna har—say, an empty vial even—den, har mast-heads dem keep manned to di last; an not til har skysail-poles sail in among di spires a di port, she altogether relinquish di hope fi capture one whale more.</p>
<p>Now, as di business a standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, a one very ancient an interesting one, mek wi inna some measure expatiate yah. Mi tek it, seh di fos standers a mast-heads was di old Egyptians; cause, inna all mi researches, mi neva find none prior to dem. For though dem progenitors, di builders a Babel, mus doubtless, by dem tower, have intended fi rear di loftiest mast-head inna all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere di final truck did put to it) as dat deh great stone mast a dem may be said fi gone by di board, inna di dread gale a God's wrath; so, wi cyan gi dem Babel builders deh priority ova di Egyptians. An dat di Egyptians dem was a nation a mast-head standers, a one assertion based pan di general belief mongst archæologists, seh di first pyramids dem did found fi astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by di peculiar stair-like formation a all four sides a dem deh edifices; whereby, wid prodigious long upliftings a dem legs, dem old astronomers deh did wont fi mount to di apex, an sing out fi new stars; even as di look-outs a one modern ship sing out fi a sail, or a whale jus bearing in sight. Inna Saint Stylites, di famous Christian hermit a old times, weh did build him a lofty stone pillar inna di desert an spen di whole latter portion a him life pan it summit, a hoist him food fram di ground wid a tackle; inna him wi have a remarkable instance a one dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who neva fi get drive fram him place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everyting out to di last, literally died at him post. A modern standers-of-mast-heads wi have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, an bronze man; who, though well capable fi face out a stiff gale, dem still entirely incompetent to di business a singing out upon discovery any strange sight. Deh deh Napoleon; who, pan di top a di column a Vendome, stan wid arms fold, some one hundred an fifty feet inna di air; careless, now, who rule di decks dem below; weda Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis di Devil. Great Washington, too, stan up high aloft pan him towering main-mast inna Baltimore, an like one a Hercules's pillars, him column mark dat deh point a human grandeur beyond weh few mortals ago go. Admiral Nelson, also, pan a capstan a gun-metal, stan up him mast-head inna Trafalgar Square; an ever wen most obscured by dat deh London smoke, token is yet given dat a hidden hero deh deh; kaa we sumuok de, faiya afi de de. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to befriend by dem counsels the distracted decks upon which dem gaze; however it may be surmised, dat dem spirits penetrate thru di thick haze a di future, an descry weh shoals an weh rocks must be shunned.</p>
<p>It may seem unwarrantable fi couple in any respect di mast-head standers a di lan wid dem a di sea; but dat in truth it no so, is plainly evinced by an item fi which Obed Macy, di sole historian of Nantucket, stan accountable. Di worthy Obed tell wi, seh inna di early times a di whale fishery, ere ships did a regularly launch inna pursuit a di game, di people dem a dat deh island did a erect lofty spars along di sea-coast, to which di look-outs dem did ascend by means a nailed cleats, someting as fowls go upstair inna a hen-house. A few years ago dis same plan was adopted by di Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying di game, give notice to di ready-manned boats nigh di beach. But dis custom don ton obsolete now; turn we den to di one proper mast-head, dat a one whale-ship at sea. Di three mast-heads dem keep manned fram sun-rise to sun-set; di seamen dem tek dem regular turns (as at di helm), an relieve each other every two hours. Inna di serene weather a di tropics it is exceedingly pleasant di mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. Deh yuh stan op, a hundred feet above di silent decks, a stride along di deep, as if di masts dem a did gigantic stilts, while beath yuh an between yuh legs, as it were, swim di hugest monsters a di sea, even as ships once sail between di boots a di famous Colossus at old Rhodes. Deh deh yuh stan, lost inna di infinite series a di sea, wid notn ruffled but di waves. Di trance ship indolently rolls; di drowsy trade winds blow; everyting resolve yuh inna languor. Fi di most part, inna dis tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invest yuh; yuh hear no news; read no gazettes; extras wid startling accounts a commonplaces neva delude yuh into unnecessary excitements; yuh hear bout no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall a stocks; yuh neva trouble wid di thought a weh yuh a go have fi dinner—fi all yuh meals fi three years an more snugly stowed inna casks, an yuh bill a fare is immutable.</p>
<p>Inna one a dem southern whalesman deh, pan a long three or four years' voyage, as often happen, di sum a di various hours yuh spend at di mast-head woulda amount to several entire months. An it is much fi be deplored dat di place to weh yuh devote so considerable a portion a di whole term a yuh natural life, shuda be so sadly destitute a anyting weh approach to a cozy inhabitiveness, or adapted fi breed a comfortable localness a feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, any small or sugn and others contrivances in which man temporarily isolate demself. Yuh most usual point a perch a di head a di t' gallant-mast, weh yuh stan op pan two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) weh dem call di t' gallant cross-trees. Yahso, tossed bout by di sea, di beginner feel bout as cozy as him woulda stan up pan a bull's horns. Fi be sure, inna cold weather yuh can carry yuh house aloft wid yuh, inna di shape a one watch-coat; but properly speaking di thickest watch-coat a nuh more a house dan di unclad body; fi as di soul glue inside a it fleshy tabernacle, an can't freely move bout inna it, nor even move outa it, widout running great risk a perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing di snowy Alps inna winter); so a watch-coat a nuh so much a one house as it a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing yuh. Yuh cyaan put a shelf or chest a drawers inna yuh body, an no more yuh can mek a convenient closet a yuh watch-coat.</p>
<p>Concerning all dis, it is much fi be deplored dat di mast-heads a one southern whale ship dem unprovided wid dem enviable likkle tents or pulpits, called <i>crow's-nests</i> , in which di look-outs a one Greenland whale are protected fram di inclement weather a di frozen seas. Inna di fireside narrative a Captain Sleet, weh dem call “A Voyage among di Icebergs, in quest a di Greenland Whale, an incidentally fi di re-discovery a di Lost Icelandic Colonies a Old Greenland;” inna dis admirable volume, all standers a mast-heads dem furnish wid a charmingly circumstantial account a di den recently invented <i>crow's-nest</i> a di Glacier, weh was di name a Captain Sleet's good craft. Im call it di <i>Sleet's crow's-nest</i> , fi ana imself; im a di original inventor an patentee, an free fram all ridiculous false delicacy, an holding dat if we call wi own pickney dem afta wi own names (we fadda dem a di original inventors an patentes), so likewise shuda we denominate afta wiself any ada apparatus we may beget. Inna shape, di Sleet's crow's-nest a someting like a big tierce or pipe; it open above, however, weh it furnished wid a movable side-screen fi keep to windward a yuh head inna a hard gale. Being fixed pan di summit a di mast, yuh ascend inna it thru a likkle trap-hatch inna di bottom. Pan di after side, or side next di stern a di ship, is a comfortable seat, wid a locker unda it fi umbrellas, comforters, an coats. In front is a leather rack, in which yuh can keep yuh speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, an other nautical conveniences. Wen Captain Sleet inna person did a stan up him mast-head inna dis crow's-nest a him, him tell wi seh him always did have a rifle wid him (also fixed inna di rack), tugeda wid a powder flask an shot, fi di purpose a popping off di stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns weh did a infest dem water deh; fi yuh cyaan successfully shoot at dem fram di deck owing to di resistance a di wata, but fi shoot dung pan dem a one very different ting. Now, it was plainly a labor of love fi Captain Sleet fi describe, as him do, all di likkle detailed conveniences a him crow's-nest; but though him so enlarges pan plenty a dem, an though him treat wi to a very scientific account a him experiments inna dis crow's-nest, wid a likkle compass him kip deh fi di purpose a counteracting di errors weh come fram weh dem call di “local attraction” a all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to di horizontal vicinity a di iron inna di ship's planks, an inna di Glacier's case, perhaps, to deh did have so much broken-down blacksmiths mongst har crew; Mi seh, dat though di Captain is very discreet an scientific yah, yet, fi all him learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” an “approximate errors,” him know very well, Captain Sleet, seh him neva so much immerse inna dem profound magnetic meditations deh, as fi fail fi get attracted occasionally towards dat likkle well replenice, so nittles tuck in pan one side a him crow's nest, widin easy reach a him han. Though, pan di whole, mi greatly admire an even love di brave, di honest, an learned Captain; yet mi tek it very ill a him seh him shuda so utterly ignore dat deh case-bottle, seeing how a faithful friend an comforter it must be been, while wid mittened fingers an hooded head him did a study di mathematics aloft deh inna dat deh bird's nest widin three or four perches a di pole.</p>
<p>But if wi Southern whale-fishers dem nuh so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet an him Greenlandmen dem did deh; yet dat disadvantage is greatly counter-balanced by di widely contrasting serenity a dem seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. Fi one, mi use to lounge up di rigging very leisurely, resting inna di top fi have a chat wid Queequeg, or any one else off duty weh mi might find deh; den ascending a likkle way further, an throw a lazy leg ova di top-sail yard, tek a preliminary view a di watery pastures, an so at last mount to mi ultimate destination.</p>
<p>Mek mi mek a clean breast a it yah, an frankly admit seh mi kip but sorry guard. Wid di prablem a di yuunivors a rivoers ina mi, ou mi kuda—biin lef kompliitli tu miself a soch a tingkin-engendering altitude—ou mi kuda bot laitli huol mi ablaivieshan fi obzav aal a di wail-ship dem stan op aada, “Kip yu weda yai uopn, an sing out evri taim.”</p>
<p>An mek mi inna dis place movingly admonish yuh, yuh ship-owners a Nantucket! Beware a enlisting inna yuh vigilant fisheries any lad wid lean brow an hollow eye; gien to unseasonable meditativeness; an who offer fi ship wid di Phædon instead a Bowditch inna him head. Beware a such a one, mi seh; yuh whales dem haffi be seen before dem can be kill; an dis sunken-eyed young Platonist ago tow yuh ten wakes roun di worl, an neva mek yuh one pint a sperm di richer. Nor dem monitions deh at all unneeded. Fi nowadays, di whale-fishery furnish an asylum fi plenty romantic, melancholy, an absent-minded young man, disgusted wid di carking cares a earth, an seeking sentiment inna tar an blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon di mast-head a some luckless disappointed whale-ship, an inna moody phrase ejaculates:—</p>
<div class="pgmonospaced">“Roll on, yuh deep an dark blue ocean, roll!<br/> Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep ova yuh inna vain.”<br/></div>
<p>Very often do di captains a such ships tek dem absent-minded young philosophers to task, upbraiding dem wid not feeling sufficient “interest” inna di voyage; half-hinting seh dem so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition, as dat inna dem secret soul dem woulda radda not see whales dan otherwise. But all inna vain; dem young Platonists deh have a notion seh dem vision is imperfect; dem short-sighted; weh use, den, fi strain di visual nerve? Dem lef dem opera-glasses a dem yaad.</p>
<p>“Why, yuh monkey,” seh a harpooneer to one a dem lads yah, “we a cruise now hard pan three years, an yuh neva raise a whale yet. Whales dem scarce as hen's teet whenever yuh deh up yah.” Miebi dem did; or maybe deh mighta did have shoals a dem inna di far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is dis absent-minded youth by di blending cadence of waves wid thoughts, dat at last him lose him identity; tek di mystic ocean at him foot fi di visible image a dat de deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind an nature; an every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful ting weh eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin a some undiscernible form, seems to him di embodiment a dem elusive thoughts weh only people di soul by continually flitting through it. Inna dis enchanted mood, yuh spirit ebbs weh to weh it come fram; become diffuse through time an space; like Cranmer's sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore di round globe ova.</p>
<p>No life nuh deh inna yuh, now, except dat rocking life weh a gently rolling ship gi yuh; by har, borrowed fram di sea; by di sea, fram di inscrutable tides a God. But while dis sleep, dis dream deh pan yuh, move yuh foot or han an inch; slip yuh hold at all; an yuh identity come back inna horror. Ova Descartian vortices yuh hover. An perhaps, at mid-day, inna di fairest weather, wid one half-throttled shriek yuh drop chruu dat deh transparent air inna di summer sea, no more fi rise fi eva. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00041">CHAPTER 36. Di Quarter-Deck.</h2>
<p>( <i>Enter Ahab: Den, all.</i> )</p>
<p>A neva no lang afta di affair a di pipe, dat one maanin likl afta breakfast, Ahab, as was him wont, ascend di cabin-gangway to di deck. Deh most sea-captains usually walk at dat deh hour, as country gentlemen, afta di same meal, tek a few turns inna di garden.</p>
<p>Soon him steady, ivory stride did hear, as to an fro him pace him old rounds, upon planks so familiar to him tread, dat dem did all ova dented, like geological stones, wid di peculiar mark a him walk. Yuh did fixedly gaze, too, pan dat deh ribbed an dented brow; deh also, yuh woulda see still stranger foot-prints—di foot-prints a him one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.</p>
<p>But pan di occasion in question, dem dents deh look deeper, even as him nervous step dat deh morning lef a deeper mark. An, so full a him thought was Ahab, dat at every uniform turn weh him mek, now at di main-mast an now at di binnacle, yuh coulda almost see dat thought turn inna him as him turn, an pace in him as him pace; so completely possessing him, indeed, dat it all but seemed di inward mold a every outer movement.</p>
<p>“Yuh mark him, Flask?” Stubb whispered; “di chick weh deh inna him peck di shell. 'Twill soon be out.”</p>
<p>Di owa dem did a gwaan;—Ahab now shet op inna im cabin; anon, pacing di deck, wid di same intense bigotry a purpose inna him aspect.</p>
<p>It did deh near di en a di day. Suddenly him come to a halt by di bulwarks, an inserting him bone leg inna di auger-hole deh, an wid one han a grab a shroud, him order Starbuck fi send everybody aft.</p>
<p>"Sar!" seh di mate, astonished at an order seldom or neva given pan ship-board except inna some extraordinary case.</p>
<p>“Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, deh! come dung!”</p>
<p>Wen di entire ship's company did assemble, an wid curious an not wholly unaapprehensive faces, did a eyeing him, cause him did look not unlike di weather horizon wen a storm did a come up, Ahab, afta him did rapidly glancing ova di bulwarks, an den dart him eyes mongst di crew, staat fram him standpoint; an as if no soul neva deh near him, him staat him heavy turns pan di deck. Wid bent head an half-slouched hat him continue fi pace, unmindful a di wondering whispering mongst di man dem; til Stubb cautiously whisper to Flask, dat Ahab mus did call dem deh fi di purpose a witness a pedestrian feat. But dis neva last long. Vehemently pausing, him cried:—</p>
<p>“Weh yuh do wen yuh see a whale, man?”</p>
<p>“Sing out fi him!” was di impulsive rejoinder fram a score a clubbed voices.</p>
<p>"Gud!" Ahab baal out, wid a wild approval inna him tones; observing di hearty animation in which him unexpected question did so magnetically throw dem.</p>
<p>“An weh unu a go do neks, man dem?”</p>
<p>“Lower weh, an afta him!”</p>
<p>“An weh tune yuh a pull to, man?”</p>
<p>“A dead whale or a stove boat!”</p>
<p>More an more strangely an fiercely glad an approving, grow di countenance a di old man at every shout; while di mariners dem staat gaze curiously at each other, as if dem did a marvel how it was dat demself did get so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.</p>
<p>But, dem did all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving inna him pivot-hole, wid one han reaching high up a shroud, an tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, address dem so:—</p>
<p>“All unu mast-headers dem have before now hear mi gi orders bout a white whale. Look unu! d’ye see dis Spanish ounce a gold?”—holding up a broad bright coin to di sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand mi yon top-maul.”</p>
<p>While di mate did a get di hammer, Ahab, widout speaking, did a slowly rub di gold piece gens di skirts a him jacket, as if fi heighten it lustre, an widout using no words did a meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled an inarticulate dat it did look like di mechanical a di humming inna him wheels im.</p>
<p>Wen him get di top-maul fram Starbuck, him advance towards di main-mast wid di hammer uplifted inna one han, exhibiting di gold wid di ada one, an wid a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever a unu raise mi a white-headed whale wid a wrinkled brow an a crooked whosover who raise mi jawewhewhewhale, white-whale; wid three holes punctured inna him starboard fluke—look ye, whoseeva a unu raise mi dat deh same white whale, him ago have dis gold ounce, mi boys!”</p>
<p>“Huzza! huzza!” di seamen dem did a baal out, as wid swinging tarpaulin dem did a hail di act a nail di gold to di mast.</p>
<p>“A wan wait wail animal, mi se,” Ahab se agen, az im fling dong di topmaul: “a wait wail animal. Skin yu yai dem fi im, man; luk shaap fi wait waata; ef yu si onggl wan bubble, sing out.”</p>
<p>All dis while Tashtego, Daggoo, an Queequeg did a look pon wid even more intense interest an surprise dan di rest, an at di mention a di wrinkled brow an crooked jaw dem did staat as if each did separately touch by some specific recollection.</p>
<p>“Captain Ahab,” Tashtego seh, “dat deh white whale mus be di same weh some call Moby Dick.”</p>
<p>“Moby Dick?” Ahab baal out. “Yuh know di white whale den, Tash?”</p>
<p>“Im fan-tail a likkle curious, sa, before him go dung?” seh di Gay-Header deliberately.</p>
<p>“An im have a curious spout, too,” seh Daggoo, “very bushy, even fi a parmacetty, an mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”</p>
<p>“An him have one, two, three—oh! good many iron inna him hide, too, Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him—him—” faltering hard fi a word, an screw him han round an round as if him a uncork a bottle—“like him—him—”</p>
<p>“Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, di harpoons dem lie all twisted an wrenched inna him; aye, Daggoo, him spout a one big one, like a whole shock a wheat, an white as a pile a wi Nantucket wool afta di great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, an him fan-split like a shell an squall. devils!</p>
<p>“Captain Ahab,” seh Starbuck, who, wid Stubb an Flask, did thus far a eyeing him superior wid increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck wid a thought weh somewhat explain all di wonder. “Captain Ahab, mi hear bout Moby Dick—but a nuh Moby Dick did tek off yuh leg?”</p>
<p>“A who tell yuh dat?” Ahab did a baal out; den pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, mi hearties all round; a Moby Dick weh did dismasted mi; Moby Dick weh bring mi to dis dead stump weh mi stan pan now. Aye, aye,” him shout wid a terrific, loud, animal sob, like dat a one heart-stricken moose; “Aye, aye! a dat deh accursed white whale weh raze mi; mek a poor pegging lubber a mi fi eva an a day!” Den tossing both arms, wid measureless imprecations him shout out: “Aye, aye! an mi ago chase him roun Good Hope, an roun di Horn, an roun di Norway Maelstrom, an roun di perdition's flames before mi gi him up. An dis a weh unu ship fah, man! fi chase dat deh white whale pan both sides a lan, an all ova sides a earth, him spuut, blood an rolls fin out. Weh yuh seh, man, yuh ago splice han pan it, now?</p>
<p>“Aye, aye!” shout di harpooneers an seamen, running closer to di excited old man: “A shaap eye fi di white whale; a shaap lance fi Moby Dick!”</p>
<p>“God bless yuh,” him did a half sob an half shout. “Gad bless yuh, man. Steward! go draw di great measure a grog. But weh dis long face bout, Mr. Starbuck; yuh naa go chase di white whale? yuh nuh game fi Moby Dick?”</p>
<p>“Mi a game fi him crooked jaw, an fi di jaws a Death too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly come inna di way a di business we a follow; but mi come yah fi hunt whales, not fi mi commander's vengeance. How many barrels yuh vengeance ago gi yuh even if yuh get it, Captain Ahab it naa go fetch much inna di Nantuck maakit.”</p>
<p>“Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; yuh need a likkle lower layer. If money's fi be di measurer, man, an di accountants dem compute dem great counting-house di globe, by girdling it wid guineas, one to every three parts a an inch; den, mek mi tell yuh, dat mi vengeance ago fetch a great premium <i>yah”!</i></p>
<p>“Im smite him chest,” Stubb whispered, “we dat fa? mi tink it ring most vast, but hollow.”</p>
<p>“Vengeance pan a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, "dat simply smote yuh fram blindest instinct! Madness! Fi be enraged wid a dumb ting, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous."</p>
<p>“Hark yuh yet again—di likkle lower layer. All visible objects, man, a jus as pasteboard masks. But inna each event—inna di living act, di undoubted deed—deh, some unknown but still reasoning ting put out di moldings a it features fram behind di unreasoning mask. If man a go strike, strike di mask outside di prison by except by reach! Thrusting through di wall? To mi, di white whale is dat deh wall, pushed near to mi. But 'tis enough Him tasks mi; white whale principal, mi ago wreak dat deh hate pan him. No talk to mi bout blasphemy, man; mi woulda strike di sun if it did insult mi. kanfidens. Tek aaf yu yai! muo intolerabl dah fiends glaaring a wahn doltish staar! So, so; yu a riddenlis an pales; mi iit don melt yu fi beks wid beks. Bot luk unu, pan tap a dat, no mata wa dem se iina it, a dat dem se it no miin. Dem av man fram uu waam wod likl indigniti. Mi did miin se mi no fi kip yu. Mek it go. Luk ya! See yonder Chilian! him snorts fi tink bout it. foremast <i>-</i> hand have clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee! <i>Speak</i> , but speak!—Aye, aye! rebellion.”</p>
<p>“Gad keep mi!—keep wi all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.</p>
<p>But inna him joy at di enchanted, tacit acquiescence a di mate, Ahab neva hear him foreboding invocation; nor yet di low laugh fram di hold; nor yet di presaging vibrations a di winds inna di cordage; nor yet di hollow flap a di sails against di masts, as fi a moment dem hearts sank in. Fi again Starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up wid di stubbornness a life; di subterranean laugh dead weh; di winds dem did a bluo aan; di sail dem did full out; di ship did a heave an roll as before. Ah, yuh admonitions an warnings! wa mek unu no stie wen unu kom? But rather unu a predictions dan warnings, unu shadows! Yet not so much predictions fram outout, as verifications a di foregoing tings widin. For wid likkle external fi constrain wi, di innermost necessities inna wi being, dem still drive wi on.</p>
<p>“Di mejament, di mejament!” Ahab baal out.</p>
<p>Wen him get di brimming pewter, an turn to di harpooneers, him order dem fi produce dem weapons. Den rang dem before him near di capstan, wid dem harpoons inna dem han, while him three mates did a stan op a him side wid dem lances, an di rest a di ship's company did a form a circle roun di group; him stan op fi a instant searchingly eyeing every man a him crew. But dem wild eyes deh meet him, as di bloodshot eyes a di prairie wolves meet di eye a dem leader, ere him rush on at dem head inna di trail a di bison; but, alas! only fi fall inna di hidden snare a di Indian.</p>
<p>“Drink an pass!” him cry, an gi di heavy charged flagon to di nearest seaman. “Di crew dem alone a drink now. Round wid it, round! Short draughts—long swallows, man; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof. So, so; it go round excellently. It spiralize inna yuh; forks out at di serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. Dat way it go, dis way it comes—Mehre it meh—yeem, it meh! di years; so brimming life is gulped an gone.</p>
<p>“Attend now, mi braves. Mi have mustered unu all round dis capstan; an unu mates, flank mi wid unu lances; an unu harpooneers, stan up deh wid unu irons; an unu, stout mariners, ring mi in, dat mi can in some sort revive a noble custom of mi fisherman fadda dem before mi. O man, unu will yet see dat deh bonny? Hand it me. Why, now, dis pewter did run brimming again, were't thou St. Vitus' imp—away, you ague!</p>
<p>“Advance, ye mates! Cross yuh lances full before mi. Well done! Mek mi touch di axis.” So seh, wid extended arm, him grab di three level, radiating lances at dem crossed centre; while dem did a do so, suddenly an nervously twitch dem; meanwhile, glancing intently fram Starbuck to Stubb; fram Stubb to Flask. It did look like, by some nameless, interior volition, him woulda fain have shock inna dem di same fiery emotion accumulated widin di Leyden jar a him own magnetic life. Di three mates quailed before him strong, sustained, an mystic aspect. Stubb an Flask look sideways fram him; di honest eye a Starbuck fall dungright.</p>
<p>“In vain!” Ahab did a baal out; “but, maybe, 'tis well. For did unu three but once tek di full-forced shock, den mi own electric ting, <i>weh</i> did perhaps expire fram outa mi. Perchance, too, it woulda drop yuh dead. Perchance yuh neva need it. Down lances! An now, yuh mates, mi do appoint yuh three cupbearers to mi three pagan kinmens—my most honorable three gentlemen, an noble men valiant harpooneers. Disdain di task? <i>Weh</i> , wen di great Pope wash di foot dem a beggars, using him tiara fi ewer?</p>
<p>Silently obeying di order, di three harpooneers dem did a stan up wid di detached iron part a dem harpoons, some three feet long, hold, barbs up, before him.</p>
<p>“No stab mi wid dat deh keen steel! Cant dem; cant dem ova! Unu no know di goblet end? Turn up di socket! So, so; now, unu cup-bearers, advance. Di irons! tek dem; hold dem while mi fill!” Forthwith, slowly going fram one officer to di ada, him brim di harpoon sockets wid di fiery waters fram di pewter.</p>
<p>“Now, three to three, yuh stan up. Commend di murderous chalices! Bestow dem, yuh who are now made parties to dis indissoluble league. Ha! Starbuck! but di deed don! Yon ratifying sun now wait fi sit upon it. Drink, yuh harpooneers! drink an swear, yuh man dem dat man di deathful sweatful—Bowbock to Godbock! hunt wi all, if wi no hunt Moby Dick to him death!” Di long, barbed steel goblets dem did lift; an to cries an maledictions against di white whale, di spirits dem did simultaneously quaffed dung wid a hiss. Starbuck pale, an turn, an shiver. Once more, an finally, di replenished pewter go di rounds mongst di frantic crew; wen, wave him free han to dem, dem all disperse; an Ahab retire widin him cabin.</p>
