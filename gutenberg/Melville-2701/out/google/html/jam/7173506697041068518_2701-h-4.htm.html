An somehow, at di time, mi did feel a sympathy an a sorrow fi him, but fi mi nuh know weh, unless it was di cruel loss a him leg. An yet mi also feel a strange awe a him; but dat deh sort a awe, weh mi cyan at all describe, neva exactly awe; Mi no know weh it was. But mi did feel it; an it neva disincline mi towards him; though mi did feel impatience at weh did look like mystery inna him, so imperfectly as him did know to mi den. However, mi thoughts dem did at length carry inna other directions, so dat fi di present dark Ahab slip mi mind.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00022">CHAPTER 17. Di Ramadan.</h2>
<p>As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was fi continue all day, mi neva choose fi disturb him til towards night-fall; fi mi cherish di greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations, neva mind how comical, an couldn't find it inna mi heart fi undervalue even a congregation a ants worshiping a toad-stool; or dem deh ada creatures inna certain parts a wi earth, weh wid a degree a footmanism quite unprecedented inna ada planets, bow dung before di torso a one deceased landed proprietor merely on account a di inordinate possessions weh dem yet own an rented inna him name.</p>
<p>Mi seh, wi good Presbyterian Christians shuda be charitable inna dem deh tings, an no fancy wiself so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans an what not, because a dem half-crazy conceits pan dem deh subjects. Deh did have Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining di most absurd notions bout Yojo an him Ramadan;—but weh a dat? Queequeg did tink him did know weh him did a bout, mi suppose; him did look like him did content; an a de-so mek im res. All wi arguing wid him wouldn't avail; mek him be, mi seh: an Heaven have mercy pan wi all—Presbyterians an Pagans alike—fi wi all somehow dreadfully cracked bout di head, an sadly need mending.</p>
<p>Towards evening, wen mi did feel assured seh all him performances an rituals must be over, mi goh up to him room an knock at di door; but no ansa. Mi try fi open it, but it did fasten inside. “Queequeg,” mi seh softly chruu di key-hole:—all silent. “Mi seh, Queequeg!wa mek yuh nuh taak?A mi—Ishmael.” But all stay still as before. Mi staat fi grow alarmed. Mi did allow him such abundant time; Mi did tink him mighta did have an apoplectic fit. Mi look thru di key-hole; but di door opening inna one odd corner a di room, di key-hole prospect was but a crooked an sinister one. Mi coulda only see part a di foot-board a di bed an a line a di wall, but notn more. Mi did surprised fi si di wooden shaft a Queequeg's harpoon, weh di landlady di evening previous did tek fram him, did a rest gens di wall, before wi did a goh to di chamber. Dat a strange, mi did tink; but at any rate, since di harpoon stan deh, an him seldom or neva go abroad widout it, so him haffi deh inside yah, an no possible mistake.</p>
<p>“Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Somting mosi did apm. Apoplexy! Mi try fi burst open di door; but it stubbornly resisted. Running dung stairs, mi quickly stated mi suspictions to di first person mi meet—di chamber-maid. “La! la!” shi baal out, “Mi did tingk se somting mosi did a gwaan. Mi go mek di bed afta brekfas, an di duor did lak; an no mout fi ier; an it did jos so sailent sins den. Bot mi did tingk, maita bi, unu did gaan aaf an lak unu bagas fi sief kip. La! la, misis!—Misis! apoplexy!”—an wid dem cries deh, she run towards di kitchen, mi a follow.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hussey soon appear, wid a mustard-pot inna one han an a vinegar-cruet inna di neda one, afta shi did jus break weh fram di occupation a attending to di castors, an a scold har likkle black bwoy meantime.</p>
<p>“Wood-house!” mi baal out, “which way to it? Run fi God's sake, an fetch someting fi pry open di door—di axe!—di axe! him get a stroke; depend pan it!”—an so saying mi did a unmethodically rush up stairs again empty-handed, wen Mrs. Hussey interpose di mostard-pot an vinegar-ctrust, an di entruce a har cantenance.</p>
<p>“Weh gwaan wid yuh, young man?”</p>
<p>“Tek di ax! Fi Gad siek, ron go luk fi di dakta, sumadi, wail mi prii it uopm!”</p>
<p>“Look yah,” di landlady seh, quickly put dung di vinegar-cruet, so as fi have one han free; “look yah; yuh a talk bout prying open any a mi doors?”—an wid dat she grab mi arm. “Weh di mata wid yuh?Weh di mata wid yuh, shipmate?”</p>
<p>In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, mi gi har fi andastan di whole case. Unconsciously clapping di vinegar-cruet to one side a har nose, she ruminate fi an instant; den exclaimed—“No! Mi neva si it since mi put it deh.” Running to a likkle closet unda di landing a di stairs, she glance in, an returning, tell mi seh Queequeg's harpoon did miss. “Im kil imself,” shi baal out. “It's unfort'nate Stiggs done ova again—there go anodda counterpane—God pity him poor mada!—it ago be di ruin a mi house. Di poor lad have a sista? Weh dat deh girl deh?—deh, Betty, go to Snarles di Painter, an tell him fi paint mi a sign,—wid permitted suicide, an smoking yah parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? Di Lord be merciful to him ghost! Weh dat deh noise deh? Yuh, young man, avast deh!”</p>
<p>An running up afta mi, she ketch mi as mi did a try force open di door agen.</p>
<p>“Mi no allow it; mi naa go have mi premises spoiled. Go fi di locksmith, deh deh one bout a mile fram yah. But avast!” putting har han inna har side-pocket, “yah a one key weh ago fit, mi guess; mek wi see.” An wid dat, she turn it inna di lock; but, alas! Queequeg's supplemental bolt did remain unwithdrawn widin.</p>
<p>“Have to burst it open,” seh mi, an did a run dung di entry likkle, fi a good staat, wen di landlady ketch at mi, again vowing mi shudn't break dung har premises; but mi tire fram har, an wid a sudden body rush dash miself full against di mark.</p>
<p>Wid a prodigious noise di door fly open, an di knob slam against di wall, sen di plaster to di ceiling; an deh, good heaven! deh did deh Queequeg, altogether cool an self-collected; rait inna di middle a di room; squatting pan him hams, an holding Yojo pan top a him head. Im neva look no one way nor di ada way, but im did sidong like a carved image wid scarce a sign a active life.</p>
<p>“Kwiik,” mi se, a go op tu im, “Kwiik, we a gwaan wid yu?”</p>
<p>“Im neva sitn so all day, noh?” di landlady seh.</p>
<p>But all we seh, not a word we coulda drag outa him; Mi almost did feel like mi did a push him ova, so as fi change him position, fi it was almost intolerable, it did look so painfully an unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all probability him did a sidong so fi upwards a eight or ten hours, going too widout him regular meals.</p>
<p>“Misis Hussey,” mi se, “im <i>alaiv</i> at aal ivent; so lef wi, ef yu pliiz, an mi wi si tu dis schrienj afier miself.”</p>
<p>Closing di door pan di landlady, mi endeavour fi prevail pan Queequeg fi tek a chair; but inna vain. A de so im did sidong; an all him coulda do—fi all mi polite arts an blandishments—im wouldn't move a peg, nor seh a single word, nor even look pon mi, nor notice mi presence inna di slightest way.</p>
<p>Mi wanda, mi did tink, if dis can possibly be a part a him Ramadan; do dem fast pan dem hams dat way inna him native island. It mus be so; yes, a part a him creed, mi suppose; well, den, mek him rest; him ago get up sooner or later, no doubt. It cyaan last fi eva, tank God, an him Ramadan only come once a year; an mi nuh believe it very punctual den.</p>
<p>Mi go dung fi supper. Afta mi sidong fi a lang taim a lisn tu di lang stuori dem a som sailor dem weh did jos kom fram wan plum-pudding voyage, az dem kaal it (dat a, wan shaat whaling-voyage ina wan schooner ar brig, kanfain tu di naat a di lain, inna di Atlantik Uoshan onggl); afta mi lisn tu dem plum-puddingers yah til nearly eleven o'clock, mi go op stairs fi go a bed, an mi did a feel quite sure by dis time Queequeg mus certainly did bring him Ramadan to a termination. But no; deh him did deh jus weh mi did lef him; him neva stir a inch. Mi staat fi get beks wid im; it did look so downright senseless an insane fi be sitting deh all day an half di night pan him hams inna a cold room, a hold a piece a wood pan him head.</p>
<p>“Fi evn sake, Kwiik, git op an shiek yuself, git op an nyam som sopa, an yu a-go staav, Kwiik, yu a-go kil yuself.” But him neva ansa a wod.</p>
<p>Despairing a him, so, mi decide fi go a bed an sleep; an no doubt, before a great time, him woulda follow mi. But before mi turn in, mi tek mi heavy bearskin jacket, an throw it ova him, as it promise fi be a very cold night; an him neva have nutten but him ordinary round jacket on. Fi some time, do all mi woulda, mi couldn't get inna di faintest doze. Mi did blow out di candle; an di mere thought a Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting deh inna dat deh uneasy position, stark alone inna di cold an dark; dis mek mi really wretched. Tingk bout it; sleeping all night inna di same room wid a wide awake pagan pan him hams inna dis dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!</p>
<p>But somehow mi drop off at last, an neva know notn more til break lait; wen, looking ova di bedside, deh squat Queequeg, as if him did get screw dung to di floor. But as soon as di first glimpse a sun did come inna di window, up him get, wid stiff an grating joints, but wid a cheerful look; limp towards mi weh mi did a lay; press him forehead again against mine; an seh him Ramadan don.</p>
<p>Now, as mi did hint before, mi have no objection to any person's religion, be it what it may, so long as dat deh person nuh kill or insult no other person, cause dat deh other person nuh believe it too. But wen a man's religion become really frantic; wen it a one positive torment to him; an, in fine, mek dis earth a wi an uncomfortable inn fi lodge inna; den mi tink it high time fi tek dat deh individual aside an argue di point wid him.</p>
<p>An jus so mi did now wid Queequeg. “Queequeg,” mi seh, “get inna bed now, an lie an lisn to mi.” Mi den go on, staatin wid di rise an progress a di primitive religions dem, an kom dong tu di various religions dem a di present time, inna weh taim mi did a labour fi shuo Queequeg seh all dem Lents, Ramadans, an prolonged ham-squattings inna cold, cheerless rooms dem a did stark nonsense; bad fi di health; useless fi di soul; opposed, in short, to di obvious laws a Hygiene an common sense. Mi tell him, too, seh him being inna ada tings such an extremely sensible an sagacious savage, it pained mi, very badly pained mi, fi see him now so deplorably foolish bout dis ridiculous Ramadan a him. Besides, argued mi, fasting mek di body cave in; hence di spirit cave in; an all thoughts weh born a fast haffi necessarily be half-starved. Dis a di reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions bout dem hereafters. Inna one word, Queequeg, seh mi, radda digressively; hell a one idea weh first born pan a undigested apple-dumpling; an since den perpetuated through di hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.</p>
<p>Mi den ask Queequeg if him himself did eva trouble wid dyspepsia; express di idea very plainly, so dat him coulda tek it in. Him seh no; only upon one memorable occasion. A did afta a great feast weh him fadda di king did gi, pan di gaining a one big battle weh fifty a di enemy dem did get kill by bout two o'clock inna di aftanuun, an all cook an eat dat deh very evening.</p>
<p>“No more, Queequeg,” seh mi, a shiem; “dat ago do;” fi mi did know di inferences widout him further hinting dem. Mi did si a sailor weh did visit dat deh very island, an him tell mi seh a di custom, wen a great battle did a gwaan deh, fi barbecue all di slain dem inna di yaad or garden a di victor; an den, one by one, dem put dem inna big wooden trenchers, an garnish dem roun like a pilau, wid breadfruit an cocoanuts; an wid some parsley inna dem mout, dem sen dem roun wid di victor's compliments to all him fren dem, jus like dem presents deh was so many Christmas turkeys.</p>
<p>Afta all, mi no tink seh mi remarks bout religion mek much impression pan Queequeg. Bikaaz, inna di fos plies, him somehow did look dull a hearing pan dat deh important subject, unless considered fram him own point a view; an, inna di secan place, him neva more dan one third andastan mi, couch mi ideas simply as mi woulda; an, finally, him no doubt did tink seh him did know a good deal more bout di true religion dan mi. Im look pon mi wid a sort a condescending concern an compassion, as if im did tink it a great pity dat such a sensible young man shuda be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.</p>
<p>At last wi get up an dress; an Queequeg, tek a prodigiously hearty breakfast a chowders a all sorts, so dat di landlady shudn mek much profit by reason a him Ramadan, wi sallied out fi board di Pequod, sauntering along, an picking wi teet dem wid halibut bones.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00023">CHAPTER 18. Him Mark.</h2>
<p>As we did a walk dung di end a di wharf towards di ship, Queequeg a carry him harpoon, Captain Peleg inna him gruff voice loudly hail wi fram him wigwam, an seh him neva did tink seh mi fren a did a cannibal, an furthermore announce seh him neva mek no cannibal pan di ship, unless dem did produce dem papers before.</p>
<p>“Weh yuh mean wid dat, Captain Peleg?” mi seh, now a jump pan di bulwarks, an a lef mi comrade a stan op pan di wharf.</p>
<p>“Mi mean,” him ansa, “im haffi show him papers.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Captain Bildad seh inna him hollow voice, a stick him head fram behind Peleg's, outa di wigwam. “Im haffi show seh him convert. Son a darkness,” him added, turning to Queequeg, “yuh at present inna communion wid any Christian church?”</p>
<p>“Why,” mi seh, “im a one memba a di fos Congregational Church.” Yahso be it seh, dat plenty tattooed savages weh a sail inna Nantucket ships at last come fi get convert inna di churches.</p>
<p>“First Congregational Church,” Bildad baal out, “weh! dat worship inna Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?” an so saying, tek out him spectacles, him rub dem wid him great yellow bandana handkerchief, an put dem on very carefully, come outa di wigwam, an leaning stiffly ova di bulwarks, tek a good long look pon Queequeg.</p>
<p>“How long him a member?” him den seh, turn to mi; “not very long, mi radda guess, young man.”</p>
<p>“Nuo,” Peleg se, “an im neva get baptaiz rait tu, ar it wuda wash som a dat de devl bluu aafa im fies.”</p>
<p>“Tel mi nou, Bildad baal out, “da Filistiin man ya a wan memba a di Diikan Dutaranomi miitn, mi neva si im go de, an mi paas it evri Laad die.”</p>
<p>“Mi nuh know notn bout Deacon Deuteronomy or him meeting,” seh mi; “all mi know is, dat Queequeg yah a one born member a di First Congregational Church. Him a one deacon himself, Queequeg is.”</p>
<p>“Young man,” Bildad seh sternly, “yuh a skylark wid mi—explien yuhself, yuh young Hittite. Weh church yuh mean? Ansa mi.”</p>
<p>Wen mi find miself so hard push, mi reply. “Mi mean, sir, di same ancient Catholic Church weh yuh an mi, an Captain Peleg deh, an Queequeg yah, an all a wi, an every mada son an soul a wi belong; di great an everlasting First Congregation a dis whole worshiping world; wi all belong to dat; only some a wi cherish some queer crotchets no way belief inna di grand belief <i>weh</i> we all join;</p>
<p>“Splice, yuh mean's <i>splice</i> hands,” Peleg baal out, a drawing nearer. “Yong man, yuh beta ship fi a missionary, instead a fore-mast han; mi neva hear a beta sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Fada Mapple himself kudn beat it, an him reckoned someting. Come aboard, come aboard; neva mind bout di papers. Mi seh, tell Quog deh—quoh a call yuh step fi tell him? along. By di great anchor, what a harpoon him have deh! an him handle it bout right.</p>
<p>Widout saying a word, Queequeg, inna him wild sort a way, jump pan di bulwarks, fram deh inna di bows a one a di whale-boats dem weh did a hang to di side; an den brace him left knee, an poising him harpoon, cried out inna some such way as dis:—</p>
<p>“Cap'ain, yuh see him small drop tar pan wata dere?Yuh see him?well, spose him one whale eye,well, den!” an tek shaap aim pan it, im dart di iron rait uova uol Bildad braad brim, kliin kraas di ship deck dem, an lik di glistening tar spot outa sight.</p>
<p>“Now,” Queequeg seh, quietly hauling inna di line, “spos-ee him whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.”</p>
<p>“Quick, Bildad,” seh Peleg, him partner, who, aghast at di close vicinity a di flying harpoon, did retreat towards di cabin gangway. “Quick, mi seh, yuh Bildad, an get di ship's papers. Wi haffi have Hedgehog deh, mi mean Quohog, inna one a wi boat dem. Look yuh, Quohog, wi ago gi yuh di ninetieth lay, an dat a more dan eva did get a harpooneer yet outa Nantucket.”</p>
<p>So dong wi go inna di cabin, an to mi great joy Queequeg did soon enrolled mongst di same ship's company weh miself belong to.</p>
<p>Wen all preliminaries did ova an Peleg did get everyting ready fi sign, him turn to mi an seh, “Mi guess, Quohog deh nuh know how fi write, noh him? Mi seh, Quohog, blast ye! yuh sign yuh name or mek yuh mark?”</p>
<p>But at dis question, Queequeg, who did tek part inna similar ceremonies two or thrice before, did look no ways abashed; but tek di pen weh dem did offer, copy pan di paper, inna di proper place, an exact counterpart a one queer round figure weh did tattoo pan him arm; so dat chruu Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching him appellative, it did stan someting like dis:—</p>
<p>Quohog. him X mark.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Captain Bildad did sidong earnestly an steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, an at last rise solemnly an fumbling inna di huge pockets a him broad-skirted drab coat, tek out a bundle a tracts, an select one weh dem call “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” den put it inna Queequeg, an grab it inna Queeg dem an di book wid both him, look earnestly inna him eyes, an seh, “Son a darkness, mi haffi do mi duty by yuh; mi a part owna a dis ship, an mi feel concern fi di souls a all it crew; if yuh still clingest to yuh Pagan ways, weh mi sadly fear, mi beg yuh, no remain fi aye bonds. hideous dragon; turn fram di wrath weh a come;</p>
<p>Somting a di salt sea yet linger inna old Bildad's language, heterogeneously mixed wid Scriptural an domestic phrases.</p>
<p>“Avast deh, avast deh, Bildad, avast now a spoil wi harpooneer,” Peleg did a baal out. “Pious harpooneers neva mek good voyagers—it tek di shark outa 'em; no harpooneer neva worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish. Deh did have young Nat Swaine, once di bravest boat-header outa all Nantucket an di Vineyard; him did jain di meeting, an neva come to right. Him get so fraid bout him soul, dat him did fraid soul, dat him did fraitn, an sheer weh fram whales, fi fear a after-claps, in case him get stove an go to Davy Jones.”</p>
<p>“Peleg! Peleg!” seh Bildad, lifting him eyes an hands, “yuhself, as miself, have seen many a perilous time; yuh know, Peleg, weh it mean fi have di fear a death; how, den, can't yuh prate inna dis ungodly guise. Yuh believe yuh own heart, Peleg. Tell mi, wen dis same Pequod did have yah ova har three massboard inna Japan, dat deh same typehoon voyage wen yuh did go mate wid Captain Ahab, yuh neva tink bout Death an di Judgment den?”</p>
<p>“Ier im, ier im nou,” Peleg baal out, a maach kraas di kyabin, an a chruo im an dem faar dong ina im poket,—“ier im, aal a unu. Tingk bout dat! Wen evri moutn wi did tingk se di ship wuda sink! Ded an di Jojment den? Wa? Wid aal a di chrii mast dem a mek soch a evalastin tonda gens di saida; an a luk uova wi, an tink. a Death an di Judgment den? No! Life was weh Captain Ahab did a tink bout;</p>
<p>Bildad seh no more, but button up him coat, stalk pan deck, weh we follow him. Deh him did a stan op, very quietly a look pan some sailmakers weh did a mend a top-sail inna di waist. Now an den him stoop fi pick up a patch, or save an end a tarred twine, weh otherwise mighta did waste.</p>

<p>“Shipmates, yuh ship inna dat deh ship?”</p>
<p>Queequeg an mi did jus lef di Pequod, an did a saunter weh fram di waata, fi di moment each occupied wid dem own thoughts, wen di above words dem did put to wi by a stranger, who, pausing before wi, level him massive forefinger at di vessel in question. Him did jus shabbily apparelled inna faded jacket an patched trowsers; a rag a black handkerchief a invest him neck. A confluent small-pox did in all directions flow ova him face, an lef it like di complicated ribbed bed a one torrent, wen di rushing waters dem did dry up.</p>
<p>“Yuh ship inna har?” him repeat.</p>
<p>“Yuh mean di ship Pequod, mi suppose,” seh mi, trying fi gain a likkle more time fi an uninterrupted look at him.</p>
<p>“Aye, di Pequod—dat ship deh,” him seh, drawing back him whole arm, an den rapidly shoving it straight out fram him, wid di fixed bayonet a him pointed finger dart full at di object.</p>
<p>“Yes,” mi seh, “we jus sign di articles dem.”</p>
<p>“Anyting dung deh bout yuh souls?”</p>
<p>“Bout weh?”</p>
<p>“Oh, maybe yuh nuh have none,” him seh quickly. “No matter though, mi know plenty chaps weh nuh have none,—good luck to 'em; an dem all di better off fi it. A soul a one sort a fifth wheel to a wagon.”</p>
<p>“Weh yuh a jabber bout, shipmate?” mi seh.</p>
<p>“ <i>Im</i> have enough, though, fi mek up fi all deficiencies a dat deh sort inna ada chaps,” di stranger seh abruptly, an put a nervous emphasis pan di wod <i>him</i> .</p>
<p>“Kwiequeg,” mi se, “mek wi gwaan, da man ya brok out fram somwe, im a taak bout sopm an sumadi we wi no nuo.”</p>
<p>"Tap!" di stranger baal out. “Yuh seh true—yuh neva si Old Thunder yet, noh?”</p>
<p>“A who Old Thunder?” seh mi, again rivetted wid di insane earnestness a him manner.</p>
<p>“Captain Ahab.”</p>
<p>“Weh! di captain a fi wi ship, di Pequod?”</p>
<p>“Aye, mongst some a wi old sailor chaps, him go wid dat deh name. Yuh neva si him yet, yuh no sie?”</p>
<p>“Nuo, wi no du dat. Dem se im sik, bot im a get beta, an im ago get beta bifuo lang.”</p>
<p>“Aal rait agen bifuo lang!” laugh di stranger, wid a solemnly derisive sort a laugh. “Look yuh, wen Captain Ahab get right, den dis left arm a mi ago get right, not before.”</p>
<p>“Weh yuh know bout him?”</p>
<p>“Wa dem <i>tel</i> yu bout im? Se so!”</p>
<p>“Dem neva tel notn bout im, onggl mi ier se im a wan gud whale-hunta, an wan gud kyapten fi im kruu.”</p>

<p>“ <i>All</i> bout it, eh—sure yuh do?—all?”</p>
<p>“Pretty sure.”</p>
<p>Wid finga pointed an eye leveled at di Pequod, di beggar-like stranger stan up a moment, as if inna a troubled reverie; den staat likl, ton roun an se:—“Yu don ship, no chruu? Niem dong pan di piepa dem? Wel, wel, wa sain, sain; an wa a go bi, ago bi; an den agen, maita it naa go bi, afta aal.

<p>“Maanin it,” mi se. “Kom lang, Kwiinz, mek wi lef dis kraasiz man. Bot stap, tel mi yu niem, wi?”</p>
<p>“Elijah.”</p>
<p>Elijah! mi did tink, an wi walk weh, both a comment, afta each ada fashion, pan dis ragged old sailor; an agree seh him a nutten but a humbug, a try fi be a bugbear. But wi neva gone perhaps above a hundred yards, wen wi chance fi turn a corner, an look back as mi did so, who shuda be seen but Elijah a follow wi, though at a distance. Somehow, di sight a him struck mi so, dat mi neva seh nutten to Queequeg bout him being behind, but pass on wid mi comrade, anxious fi see weda di stranger woulda turn di same corner weh wi did do. Him did; an den it did look like him did a dog wi, but wid weh intent mi couldn't fi di life a mi imagine. Dis circumstance, coupled wid him ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort a talk, now begat inna mi all kinds a vague wonderments an half-apprehensions, an all connected wid di Pequod; an Captain Ahab; an di leg weh him did lost; an di Cape Horn fit; an di silva calabash; an weh Captain Peleg did seh bout him, wen mi lef di ship di day before; an di prediction a di squaw Tistig; an di voyage we did bound wiself fi sail; an a hundred ada shadowy tings.</p>
<p>Mi did resolve fi satisfy miself weda dis ragged Elijah did a really dog ​​wi or not, an wid dat intent cross di way wid Queequeg, an pan dat deh side a it retrace wi steps. But Elijah pass on, widout seeming notice wi. Dis relieve mi; an once more, an finally as it did look to mi, mi pronounce him inna mi heart, a humbug.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00025">CHAPTER 20. All Astir.</h2>
<p>A day or two pass, an deh did have great activity aboard di Pequod. Not only di ole sails dem did a get fix, but new sails did a come pan board, an bolts a canvas, an coils a rigging; in short, everyting betokened seh di ship's preparations did a hurry to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or neva go asshore, but did sidong inna him wigwam a keep a sharp look-out pan di hands: Bildad did all di purchasing an providing at di stores; an di man dem weh did a work inna di hold an pan di rigging did a work til lang afta nait-fall.</p>
<p>Pan di day afta Queequeg's sign di articles, word did gi at all di inns weh di ship's company did a stop, seh dem chest dem haffi deh pan board before night, cause dem neva did a tell how soon di vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg an mi get dung wi traps, resolve, however, fi sleep ashore til di last. But it look like dem always gi very long notice inna dem case yah, an di ship neva sail fi several days. But no wonder; deh did have a good deal fi do, an yuh can tell how many tings fi tink bout, before di Pequod did fully equipped.</p>
<p>Every one know weh a multitude a tings—beds, sauce-pans, knives an forks, shovels an tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, an weh not, dem indispensable to di business a housekeeping. Jus so wid whaling, weh necessitate a three-years' housekeeping upon di wide ocean, far fram all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, an bankers. An though dis also hold true fi merchant vessels, yet not by any means to di same extent as wid whalemen. For besides di great length a di whaling voyage, di numerous articles peculiar to di prosecution a di fishery, an di impossibility fi replace dem at di remote harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, dat a all ships, whaling vessels a di most exposed to accidents a all kinds, especially to di destruction an di very tings weh dem loss success a di voyage most depends. So, di spare boats, spare spars, an spare lines an harpoons, an spare everytings, almost, but a spare Captain an duplicate ship.</p>
<p>At di period a wi arrival a di Island, di heaviest storage a di Pequod did almost complete; comprising har beef, bread, water, fuel, an iron hoops an staves. But, as before hint, fi some time deh did have a continual fetching an carrying on board a divers odds an ends a tings, both large an small.</p>
<p>Chief among dem who did do dis fetching an carrying was Captain Bildad's sista, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved dat, if <i>she</i> coulda help it, notn should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one time she woulda come on board wid a jar a pickles fi di steward's pantry; wan neks taim wid a bunch a quills fi di chief mate desk, weh him did kip him log; a third time wid a roll a flannel fi di small a some one's rheumatic back. Neva did no woman beta deserve har name, weh was Charity—Aunt Charity, as everybody did call har. An like a sista a charity did dis charitable Aunt Charity bustle bout hither an thither, ready fi turn har han an heart to anyting weh promise fi yield safety, comfort, an consolation to all on board a ship in which har beloved bredda Bildad did concern, an in which she own own a score or two a well-saved dollars.</p>
<p>But it did startling fi si dis excellent hearted Quakeress a come pan board, as she did di last day, wid a long oil-ladle inna one han, an a still longer whaling lance inna di ada. Nor Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg neva backward at all. As fi Bildad, him did a carry bout wid him a long list a di articles dem weh him did need, an at every fresh arrival, him mark did go opposite dat deh article pan di paper. Every once in a while Peleg come hobbling outa him whalebone den, roaring at di man dem dung di hatchways, roaring up to di riggers at di mast-head, an den conclude by roaring back inna him wigwam.</p>
<p>Durin dem days a preparation, Queequeg an mi often visit di craft, an as often mi ask bout Captain Ahab, an how him did deh, an wen him did a go come pan board him ship. To dem kweschan deh dem woulda ansa, seh him did a get beta an beta, an dem did a expect him fi go aboard every day; meantime, di two captains, Peleg an Bildad, coulda attend to everyting necessary fi fit di vessel fi di voyage. If mi did downright honest wid miself, mi woulda see very plainly inna mi heart seh mi did but half fancy being committed dis way to so long a voyage, widout once laying mi eyes pan di man weh was fi be di absolute dictator a it, so soon as di ship sail out pan di open sea. But wen a man suspect any wrong, it sometimes happen dat if him already involve inna di matter, him insensibly strive fi cover up him suspitions even fram himself. An much dis way it did deh wid mi. Mi neva seh notn, an mi try fi tink notn.</p>
<p>At last it did gi out seh some time next day di ship woulda certainly sail. So nex maanin, Queequeg an mi tek a very early staat.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00026">CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.</h2>
<p>A did nearly six o'clock, but only gray imperfect misty dawn, wen we did a draw nigh di wharf.</p>
<p>“Som sailor a ron front de, ef mi si rait,” mi se tu Kwiinz, “it kyaahn bi shado; shi aaf bai sonlait, mi ges; kom aan!”</p>
<p>“Avast!” cried a voice, whose owna at di same time come close behind wi, put a han pan both wi shoulda dem, an den insinuate himself between wi, stan up stooping forward a likkle, inna di uncertain twilight, strangely peering fram Queequeg to mi. A did Ilaija.</p>
<p>“Going abord?”</p>
<p>“Hands off, will yuh,” seh mi.</p>
<p>“Lookee yah,” Queequeg seh, a shake himself, “go 'way!”</p>
<p>“Yuh naa go abord, den?”</p>
<p>“Yes, wi deh,” mi seh, “but weh yuh business? Yuh know, Mr. Elijah, seh mi consider yuh a likkle impertinent?”</p>
<p>“No, no, no; mi neva know bout dat,” seh Elijah, slowly an wonderingly looking fram mi to Queequeg, wid di most unaccountable glances.</p>
<p>“Elijah,” mi seh, “yuh wi oblige mi fren an mi by withdrawing. Wi a goh di Indian an Pacific Oceans, an wi woulda prefer not be detained.”</p>
<p>“Ye be, be ye? Coming back before breakfast?”</p>
<p>“Im krak op, Kwiinz,” mi se, “kom aan.”</p>
<p>“Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing wi wen we did remove a few paces.</p>
<p>“Neva mind him,” seh mi, “Queequeg, come on.”</p>
<p>But him steal up to wi again, an suddenly clap him han pan mi shoulda, seh—“Yuh si anyting looking like man a goh towards dat deh ship a while ago?”</p>
<p>Strucked by dis plain matter-of-fact kweschan, mi ansa, seh, “Yes, mi did tink mi did si four or five man, but it did too dim fi be sure.”</p>
<p>“Very dim, very dim,” Elijah seh. “Morning to yuh.”</p>
<p>Once more we quit him; but once more him come softly afta wi; an toch mi shoulda agen, an seh, “Si if yuh can find dem now, wi?</p>
<p>“Find who?”</p>
<p>“Maanin fi unu! maanin fi unu!” him rejoin, again moving off. “Oh! Mi did a go warn yuh against—but neva mind, neva mind—it's all one, all inna di family too;—sharp frost dis morning, ain't it? Good-bye to yuh. Shan't see yuh again very soon, mi guess; unless it's before di Grand Jury.” An wid dem cracked words deh him finally lef, lef mi, fi di moment, inna no small wonderment at him frantic impudence.</p>
<p>At last, step pan di Pequod, wi find everyting inna profound quiet, not a soul moving. Di cabin entrance did lock widin; di hatches dem did all on, an lumbered wid coils a rigging. Go forward to di forecastle, we find di slide a di scuttle open. Wen wi si a light, wi go dung, an find only a ole rigger deh, wrap inna a tattered pea-jacket. Dem fling him at whole length pan two chests, him face dung an inclosed inna him folded arms. Di profoundest slumber did a sleep pan him.</p>
<p>“Dem sailors deh we si, Queequeg, weh dem coulda goh to?” mi seh, a look dubiously pan di sleeper. But it did look like, wen pan di wharf, Queequeg neva notice at all weh mi did a allude to; so mi woulda did tink miself fi get optically deceive inna dat deh matter, if it neva fi Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. But mi beat di ting dung; an again marking di sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg seh perhaps we had best sit up wid di body; telling him fi establish himself accordingly. Im put im han pan di sleeper's rear, as if im did a feel if it did soft enough; an den, widout more ado, sidong kwaiyat dong de.</p>
<p>“Gracious! Queequeg, no sidong de,” mi se.</p>
<p>“Oh! perry dood seat,” seh Queequeg, “mi country way; won't hurt him face.”</p>
<p>"Face!" mi seh, “call dat him face? very benevolent countenance den; but how hard him breath, him a heave himself; get off, Queequeg, yuh heavy, it a grind di face a di poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look, him ago twitch yuh off soon. Mi wonder him nuh wake.”</p>
<p>Queequeg tek weh himself to jus beyond di head a di sleeper, an light him tomahawk pipe. Mi sidong a di fut dem. We kip di pipe a pass ova di sleeper, fram one to di ada. Meanwhile, upon questioning him inna him broken fashion, Queequeg gi mi fi andastan seh, inna him lan, owing to di absence a settees an sofas a all sorts, di king, chiefs, an great people generally, did inna di custom a fattening some a di lower orders fi ottomans; an fi furnish a house comfortably inna dat deh respect, yuh did only haffi buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, an lay dem round inna di piers an alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; muo beta dan dem garden-chairs deh weh yuh can convert inna walking-sticks; pan occasion, a chief call him attendant, an desiring him fi mek a settee a himself unda a spreading tree, perhaps inna some damp marsh place.</p>
<p>While mi did a narrate dem ting deh, every time Queequeg get di tomahawk fram mi, him flourish di hatchet-side a it ova di sleeper's head.</p>
<p>“Weh dat fah, Queequeg?”</p>
<p>“Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”</p>
<p>Im did a go on wid some wild reminiscences bout im tomahawk-pipe, weh, it did look like, did have inna it two uses both brained im foes an soothed im soul, wen we did directly attracted to di sleeping rigger. Di strong vapor now completely fulling di contracted hole, it staat tell upon him. Im breath wid a sort a muffledness; den it look like it did a trouble inna di nose; den revolve ova once or twice; den sidong op an rub im yai dem.</p>
<p>“Holloa!” him breath at last, “who be unu smokers?”</p>
<p>“Shipped man,” mi ansa, “wen she a go sail?”</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, unu a go inna har, be ye? She sail to-day. Di Captain did come abord last night.”</p>
<p>“Weh Captain?—Ahab?”</p>
<p>“A who but him?”</p>
<p>Mi did a go ask him some more kweschan bout Ahab, wen wi hear a noise pan deck.</p>
<p>“Holloa! Starbuck's astir,” di rigger seh. “Im a lively chief mate, dat; good man, an a pious; but all alive now, mi haffi turn to.” An im se so im go pan di deck, an wi fala.</p>
<p>It did clear sunrise now. Soon di crew come pan board inna twos an threes; di riggers bestirred demself; di mates dem did actively engaged; an several a di shore people dem did busy a bring various last tings pan board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab did stay invisibly enshrined widin him cabin.</p>
