<h2><a id="chap06"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br/> Pig an Pepper</h2>
<p>Fi a minute or two she did a look pan di house, an a wanda weh fi do next, wen suddenly a footman inna livery come running out a di wood—(she consider him fi be a footman cause him did inna livery: otherwise, judging by him face only, she woulda call him a fish)—an rap loudly at di door wid him knuck. It did open by anodda footman inna livery, wid a round face, an big eyes like a frog; an both footmen, Alice notice, did have powdered hair weh curl all ova dem head. Shi did feel very curious fi know weh it was all bout, an shi crept a likkle way outa di wood fi listen.</p>
<p>Di Fish-Footman staat by produce fram unda him arm a great letta, nearly as big as himself, an dis him hand ova to di ada one, an seh, inna a solemn tone, “Fi di Duchess. An invitation fram di Queen fi play croquet.” Di Frog-Footman repeated, inna di same solemn tone, only changing di order a di words likkle, “From di Queen. An invitation fi di Duchess fi play croquet.”</p>
<p>Den dem both bow low, an dem curls get entangled tugeda.</p>
<p>Alice laugh so much at dis, dat she had to run back inna di wood fi fear dem woulda hear har; an wen she next peep out di Fish-Footman did gaan, an di ada one did a sidong pan di grong near di door, a stare stupidly up inna di sky.</p>
<p>Alice go timidly op to di door, an knock.</p>
<p>“No sortn a yuus fi nak,” se di Fuotman, “an dat fi tuu riizn. Fos, kaa mi de pan di siem said a di duor wid yu, sekan ting, kaa dem a mek so moch naiz inna di duor, nobadi kudn ier yu.” An certainly deh <i>did have</i> a most extraordinary noise a gwaan widin—a constant howling an sneezing, an every now an den a great crash, as if a dish or kettle did break to pieces.</p>
<p>“Please, den,” seh Alice, “how mi fi get in?”</p>
<p>“It might be some sense inna yuh knocking,” di Footman goh on widout attending to har, “if wi did have di door between wi. Fi egzampl, if yuh did deh <i>inside</i> , yuh might knock, an mi coulda let yuh out, yuh know.” Im did a look up inna di sky all di time im did a talk, an dis Alice did tink decidedly uncivil. “Bot miebi im kyaahn elp,” shi se tu arself; “im eyes dem deh so <i>very</i> nearly at di top a him head. But at any rate him might ansa kweschan.—How mi fi get in?” she repeated, loud.</p>
<p>“Mi ago sidong yah,” di Footman seh, “til tumaro—”</p>
<p>At dis moment di door a di house open, an a big plate come skimming out, straight at di Footman's head: it jus graze him nose, an break to pieces against one a di trees dem behind him.</p>
<p>“—or next day, maybe,” di Footman continue inna di same tone, exactly as if notn neva happen.</p>
<p>“How mi fi get in?” aks Alice agen, inna a louda tone.</p>
<p>“ <i>Yuh</i> fi get in at all?” di Footman seh. “A dat a di fos kweschan, yuh know.”</p>
<p>It was, no doubt: only Alice neva like fi be tell so. “It riili chrietn,” shi mumbl tu arself, “di wie aal a di kricha dem a aagyu. It inof fi mek sumadi get mad!”</p>
<p>Di Footman did look like him did tink dis a good opportunity fi repeat him remark, wid variations. “Mi ago sit yah,” him seh, “on an off, fi days an days.”</p>
<p>“But weh <i>mi</i> fi do?” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“Anyting yuh like,” di Footman seh, an staat whistle.</p>
<p>“Oh, it nuh use fi talk to him,” seh Alice desperately: “im perfectly idiot!” An shi uopm di duor an go iin.</p>
<p>Di door did lead right inna one big kitchen, weh did full a smoke fram one end to di other: di Duchess did a sidong pan a three-legged stool inna di middle, a nurse a baby; di cook did a lean ova di fire, a stir a big cauldron weh did look like it did full a soup.</p>
<p>“A too much pepper deh inna dat deh soup deh!” Alice seh to harself, as well as she coulda fi sneezing.</p>
<p>It did certainly too much a it inna di air. Even di Duchess did a sneeze occasionally; an as fi di baby, it did a sneeze an a howl alternately widout a moment's pause. Di ongl ting dem inna di kitchen weh neva sneeze, a did di cook, an a big cat weh did a sidong pan di hearth an a grin fram ear to ear.</p>
<p>“Please woulda yuh tell mi,” seh Alice, a likkle timidly, cause she neva quite sure if it was good manners fi har fi speak first, “why yuh cat grins like dat?”</p>
<p>“A Cheshire cat,” di Duchess seh, “an a dat mek. Pig!”</p>
<p>Shi seh di laas wod wid such sudden violence dat Alice quite jump; but she si inna anodda moment seh it did a address to di baby, an not to har, so she tek courage, an go on again:—</p>
<p>“Mi neva know seh Cheshire cats always did a grin; in fact, mi neva know seh cats <i>coulda</i> grin.”</p>
<p>“Dem all can,” di Duchess seh; “an most a dem do.”</p>
<p>“Mi no know bout non a dem weh do,” Alice seh very politely, feeling quite pleased fi get inna a conversation.</p>
<p>“Yuh nuh know much,” di Duchess seh; “an dat a one fact.”</p>
<p>Alice neva like di tone a dis remark at all, an shi did tink seh it woulda be as well fi introduce some other subject a conversation. While she did a try fix pan one, di cook tek di cauldron a soup off di fire, an at once set to work throw everyting widin har reach at di Duchess an di baby—di fire-iron dem come first; den followed a shower a saucepans, plates, an dishes. Di Duchess neva tek no notice a dem even wen dem hit har; an di baby did a howl so much already, dat it was quite impossible fi seh weda di blows dem did hurt him or not.</p>
<p>“Oh, <i>please</i> mind weh yuh a duh!” Alice baal out, a jomp op an dong inna wan agony a terror. “Oh, deh go him <i>precious</i> nose!” as an unusually large saucepan fly close by it, an very nearly carry it off.</p>
<p>“If everybody did a mind dem own business,” di Duchess seh inna a hoarse growl, “di worl woulda go round a deal faster dan it do.”</p>
<p>“Weh would <i>n't</i> be an advantage,” said Alice, who did feel very glad fi get an opportunity fi show off a likkle a har knowledge. “Jos tingk bout wa kain-a wok it wuda du wid di die an di nait! Yu si di ort tek twenti-fuo owa fi ton roun pan it axis—”</p>
<p>“Talking bout axes,” di Duchess seh, “chop off har head!”</p>
<p>Alice glance rather anxiously at di cook, fi see if she mean fi tek di hint; but di cook did busy a stir di soup, an did look like she neva did a listen, so she go on again: “Twenty-four hours, mi <i>tink</i> ; or is twelve? Mi—”</p>
<p>“Oh, no bada <i>mi</i> ,” di Duchess seh; “Mi neva coulda abide figures!” An wid dat shi staat nurse har pikni agen, a sing a sort a lullaby tu it az shi did a du so, an a gi it a violent shake a di en a evri lain:</p>
<p class="poem">“Taak rof tu yu likl bwai,<br/> An biit im wen im sniiz:<br/> Im only do it fi annoy,<br/> Bikaaz him know it tease.”</p>
<p class="center">CHORUS.<br/> (In which di cook an di baby joined):</p>
<p class="poem">“Wow! wow! wow!”</p>
<p>While di Duchess did a sing di secan verse a di song, she did a tossing di baby violently up an dung, an di poor likkle ting did a howl so, dat Alice couldn't hardly hear di words:—</p>
<p class="poem">“Mi a taak bad tu mi bwai,<br/> Mi beat him wen him sneeze;<br/> For him can thoroughly enjoy<br/> Di pepper wen him please!”</p>
<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>
<p class="poem">“Wow! wow! wow!”</p>
<p>“Yah! yuh can nurse it a bit, if yuh like!” di Duchess seh to Alice, flinging di baby at har as she did a talk. “Mi haffi go an get ready fi play croquet wid di Queen,” an she hurried out a di room. Di cook fling a frying-pan afta har as she did a goh out, but it jus miss har.</p>
<p>Alice kech di baby wid some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped likkle creature, an hold out it arms an legs inna all directions, “jus like a star-fish,” tink Alice. Di puor likl ting did a snort laik wahn stiim-injin wen shi kech it, an kip aan a dobl itself op an a schrietn itself out agen, so aaltogeda, fi di fos minit ar tuu, it did az moch az shi kuda du fi huol it.</p>
<p>As soon as she did mek out di proper way fi nursing it, (which was fi twist it up inna a sort a knot, an den keep tight hold a it right ear an left foot, so as fi prevent it undoing itself,) she carry it out inna di open air. “If mi no tek dis pikni we wid mi,” Alice tingk, “dem shuor fi kil it ina wan ar tuu die: it wudn bi morda fi lef it bihain?” Shi seh di laas wod dem out loud, an di likkle ting grunt inna reply (it did lef off sneezing by dis time). “No grunt,” Alice seh; “dat a nuh at all a proper way fi express yuhself.”</p>
<p>Di baby grunt again, an Alice look very anxiously inna it face fi see weh did a gwaan wid it. No doubt coulda be seh it did have a <i>very</i> turn-up nose, much more like a snout dan a real nose; also it eyes dem did a get extremely small fi a baby: altogether Alice neva like di look a di ting at all. “But perhaps it did only a sobbing,” she did tink, an look inna it eyes again, fi see if it did have any tears.</p>
<p>No, no tears neva deh deh. “If yu a go ton pig, mi dier,” Alis se, siiriyos, “mi naa go av notn muor fi du wid yu. Main nou!” Di poor likkle ting sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible fi seh which), an dem goh on fi some while inna silence.</p>
<p>Alice did jus staat tink to harself, “Now, weh mi fi do wid dis creature wen mi get it home?” wen it grunt again, so violently, dat she look dung inna it face inna some alarm. Dis time it coulda be <i>no</i> mistake bout it: it neva more nor less dan a pig, an she did feel seh it woulda be quite absurd fi har fi carry it further.</p>
<p>So she set di likkle creature dung, an feel quite relieved fi see it trot weh quietly inna di wood. “If it did grow up,” she seh to harself, “it woulda mek a dreadfully ugly pikni: but it mek rather a handsome pig, mi tink.” An shi staat tink ova ada pikni dem weh shi did nuo, weh maita du very gud az pig, an shi did jos a se tu harself, “if wan ongl nuo di rait wie fi chienj dem—” wen shi did a likl shak wen shi si di Cheshire Cat sidong pan wahn branch a wan chrii kopl yaad aaf.</p>
<p>Di Cat only grin wen it see Alice. It look good-natured, she did tink: still it did have <i>very</i> long claws an a great many teet, so she did feel seh it oughta be treated wid respect.</p>
<p>“Cheshire Puss,” she staat, rada timidly, as she neva know at all weda it woulda like di name: however, it only grin a likkle wider. “Kom, it pliiz so far,” Alice tingk, an shi go aan. “Yuh woulda tell mi, please, which way mi fi go fram yah?”</p>
<p>“Dat depends a good deal pan weh yuh waan get to,” di Cat seh.</p>
<p>“Mi nuh care weh—” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“Den it no mata wich wie yu go,” di Pus se.</p>
<p>“—so lang as mi get <i>somwe</i> ,” Alice added as an explanation.</p>
<p>“Ou, yu shuor fi du dat,” di Pus se, “ef yu ongl waak lang inof.”</p>
<p>Alice did feel seh dis couldn't be denied, so she try anodda question. “Weh sort a people live bout yah?”</p>
<p>“Inna <i>dat deh</i> direction,” di Cat seh, a wave it right paw round, “live a Hatter: an inna <i>dat deh</i> direction,” a wave di ada paw, “live a March Hare. Visit either yuh like: dem both mad.”</p>
<p>“But mi nuh waan go mongst mad people,” Alice remarked.</p>
<p>“Ou yu kyaahn elp dat,” di Pus se: “aal a wi mad ya. Mi mad. Yu mad.”</p>
<p>“How yuh know seh mi mad?” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“Yu mosi bi,” di Pus se, “ar yu wudn kom ya.”</p>
<p>Alice neva tink seh dat did prove it at all; ousomeba, shi go aan “An ou yu fi nuo se yu mad?”</p>
<p>“Fi staat wid,” di Pus se, “a daag no mad. Yu grant dat?”</p>
<p>“Mi suppose so,” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“Wel, den,” di Pus go aan, “yu si, daag gruol wen im beks, an wag im tiel wen im api. Nou <i>mi</i> gruon wen mi api, an wag mi tiel wen mi beks. Siek-a dat mi mad.”</p>
<p>“ <i>Mi</i> call it purring, not growling,” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“Call it weh yuh like,” di Cat seh. “Yuh play croquet wid di Queen to-day?”</p>
<p>“Mi shuda like it very much,” seh Alice, “but mi neva get invite yet.”</p>
<p>“Yu wi si mi de,” di Pus se, an vanish.</p>
<p>Alice neva much surprised at dis, she did a get so used to queer tings a gwaan. Wail shi did a luk pan di plies we it did de, it suddenli kom op agen.</p>
<p>“By-di-bye, weh happen to di baby?” di Pus seh. “Mi did nearly forget fi ask.”</p>
<p>“It ton inna a pig,” Alice quietly seh, jus as if it did come back inna a natural way.</p>
<p>“Mi did tink it woulda,” di Cat seh, an vanish again.</p>
<p>Alice wait likkle, half expecting fi see it again, but it neva appear, an afta a minute or two she walk on inna di direction weh dem seh di March Hare did a live inna. “Mi don si hatters before,” she seh to harself; “di March Hare ago be much di most interesting, an perhaps as dis a May it naa go be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was inna March.” As she seh dis, she look up, an deh did have di Cat again, a sidong pan a branch a one tree.</p>
<p>“Yuh seh pig, or fig?” di Pus seh.</p>
<p>“Mi seh pig,” Alice ansa; “an mi wish yuh wouldn't keep appearing an vanishing so suddenly: yuh mek one quite giddy.”</p>
<p>“Aal rait,” di Pus se; an dis time it vanish quite slowly, beginning wid di end a di tail, an ending wid di grin, weh did remain some time afta di rest a it did gone.</p>
<p>“Well! Mi eva si a cat widout a grin,” Alice did tink; “but a grin widout a cat! A di most curious ting mi eva si inna mi life!”</p>
<p>Shi neva go no faar bifuo shi si di ous a di Maach Hare: shi did tingk se a mosi di rait ous, kaa di chimini dem did shiep laik ier an di ruuf did kova wid fut. It was so big a house, dat she neva like fi go nearer til she did nibble some more a di lefthand bit a mushroom, an raise harself to bout two feet high: even den she walk up towards it rather timidly, an seh to harself “Suppose it shuda be raving mad afta all! Mi almost wish mi did go see di Hatter!”</p>
