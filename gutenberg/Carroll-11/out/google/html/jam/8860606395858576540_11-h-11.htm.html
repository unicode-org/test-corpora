<h2><a id="chap11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br/> Who Stole di Tarts?</h2>
<p>Di King an Queen a Hearts did a sidong pan dem throne wen dem arrive, wid a big crowd assembled roun dem—all sorts a likkle birds an beast, as well as di whole pack a cards: di Knave did a stan up inna front a dem, inna chains, wid a soldier pan each side fi guard him; an near di King did have di White Rabbit, wid a trumpet inna one han, an a scroll a parchment inna di nex one. Inna di very middle a di court was a table, wid a big dish a tarts pan it: dem look so good, dat it mek Alice quite hungry fi look pon dem—“Mi wish dem did get di trial done,” she did tink, “an hand round di refreshments!” But it did look like it neva have no chance fi dis, so she staat look pan everyting bout har, fi pass weh di time.</p>
<p>Alice neva deh inna a court of justice before, but she did read bout dem inna books, an she did quite pleased fi find out seh she did know di name a nearly everyting deh. “A dat di joj,” shi se tu arself, “kaaz a im big wig.”</p>
<p>Di judge, by di way, was di King; an as him did a wear him crown ova di wig, (look pan di frontispiece if yuh waan see how him did do it,) him neva look at all comfortable, an it did certainly neva becoming.</p>
<p>“An dat a di jury-box,” Alice did tink, “an dem twelve creature deh,” (she did obliged fi seh “creature,” yuh see, cause some a dem was animal, an some was birds,) “Mi suppose dem a di jurors.” Shi se dis laas wod tuu ar chrii taim uova tu arself, an shi did proud a it: kaa shi did tingk, an rait tu, se a likl bit a likl gyal a ar iej did nuo di miinin a it at aal. However, “jury-men” woulda did do jus as well.</p>
<p>Di twelve jurors dem did a write very busily pan slates. “Weh dem a duh?” Alice whisper to di Gryphon. “Dem cyan have notn fi put dung yet, before di trial staat.”</p>
<p>“Dem a put dung dem name,” di Gryphon whisper inna reply, “fi fraid dem fi forget dem before di end a di trial.”</p>
<p>“Stupid tings!” Alice staat inna a loud, indignant voice, but she stop hastily, fi di White Rabbit did a baal out, “Silence inna di court!” an di King put on him spectacles an look anxiously round, fi mek out who did a talk.</p>
<p>Alice coulda see, as well as if she did a look ova dem shoulda, seh all di jurors dem did a write dung “stupid tings!” pan dem slate, an she coulda even mek out seh one a dem neva know how fi spell “stupid,” an dat him did haffi ask him neighbor fi tell him. “A nice muddle dem slates ago deh inna before di trial don!” Alice did tink.</p>
<p>One a di jurors dem did have a pencil weh did a squeak. Dis of course, Alice could <i>n't</i> stan, an she go roun di court an get behind him, an very soon find an opportunity fi tek it weh. Shi did do it so quick dat di poor likkle juror (it was Bill, di Lizard) couldn't mek out at all weh did happen a it; so, afta him did a hunt all bout fi it, him did haffi write wid one finga fi di rest a di day; an dis was a very likkle use, as it neva lef no mark pan di slate.</p>
<p>“Herald, read di accusation!” di King seh.</p>
<p>Pan dis di White Rabbit blow three blast pan di trumpet, an den unroll di parchment scroll, an read as follows:—</p>
<p class="poem">“Di Queen of Hearts, she mek some tarts,<br/> All pan a summer day:<br/> Di Knave of Hearts, him did steal dem tarts deh,<br/> An tek dem quite weh!”</p>
<p>“Tingk bout yuh verdict,” di King seh to di jury.</p>
<p>“Not yet, not yet!” di Rabbit hastily interrupt. “A big ting deh fi come before dat!”</p>
<p>“Call di first witness,” seh di King; an di Wait Rabit bluo chrii blast pan di chompit, an kaal out, “Fos witnis!”</p>
<p>Di fos witness was di Hatter. Im come iin wid a teacup inna one han an a piece a bread-an-butter inna di neks one. “Mi beg pardon, yuh Majesty,” him staat, “fi bring dem ya iin: bot mi neva don finish mi tii wen dem sen mi.”</p>
<p>“Yuh shuda did finish,” di King seh. “Wen yuh staat?”</p>
<p>Di Hatter look pon di March Hare, weh did a follow him inna di court, arm-in-arm wid di Dormouse. “Fourteenth a March, mi <i>tink</i> a did,” him seh.</p>
<p>“Fifteenth,” seh di March Hare.</p>
<p>“Sixteenth,” di Dormouse added.</p>
<p>“Write dat dung,” di King seh to di jury, an di jury eagerly write dung all three dates pan dem slates, an den add dem up, an reduce di ansa to shillings an pence.</p>
<p>“Tek aaf yuh hat,” di King seh to di Hatter.</p>
<p>“A nuh fi mi,” di Hatter seh.</p>
<p>“ <i>Stolen!</i> ” di King exclaimed, turning to di jury, who instantly mek a memorandum of di fact.</p>
<p>“Mi keep dem fi sell,” di Hatter added as an explanation; “Mi no have none a mi own. Mi a one hatter.”</p>
<p>Yahso di Queen put aan har spectacles, an staat stare pan di Hatter, weh ton pale an fidgeted.</p>
<p>“Gi yuh evidence,” di King seh; “an no bada nervous, or mi ago mek dem execute yuh pan di spot.”</p>
<p>Dis neva did a encourage di witness at all: him did a shift fram one foot to di ada, a look uneasily at di Queen, an inna him confusion him bit a big piece outa him teacup instead a di bread-an-butter.</p>
<p>Jus at dis moment Alice did feel a very curious sensation, weh puzzle har a good deal until she mek out weh it was: she did a staat grow larger again, an she did tink at first she woulda get up an lef di court; but pan second thoughts she decide fi stay weh she did deh as long as deh have room fi har.</p>
<p>“Mi wish yuh neva squeeze so,” seh di Dormouse, weh did a sidong saida har. “Mi can hardly breathe.”</p>
<p>“Mi cyan help it,” seh Alice very meekly: “Mi a grow.”</p>
<p>“Yuh no have no right fi grow <i>yah</i> ,” seh di Dormouse.</p>
<p>“No taak no nonsens,” Alice seh more boldly: “yuh know yuh a grow too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but <i>mi</i> grow at a reasonable pace,” seh di Dormouse: “not inna dat deh ridiculous fashion.” An him get up very sulkily an cross ova to di ada side a di court.</p>
<p>All dis time di Queen neva lef off staring at di Hatter, an, jus as di Dormouse cross di court, she seh to one a di officers a di court, “Bring mi di list a di singers dem inna di last concert!” pan which di wretched Hatter did a tremble so, dat him shake both him shoes off.</p>
<p>“Gi yuh evidence,” di King repeated angryly, “or mi ago mek dem execute yuh, weda yuh nervous or not.”</p>
<p>“Mi a one poor man, yuh Majesty,” di Hatter staat, inna a trembling voice, “—an mi neva staat mi tea—not above a week or so—an weh wid di bread-an-butter a get so thin—an di twinkling a di tea—”</p>
<p>“Di twinkling a di <i>weh?</i> ” di King seh.</p>
<p>“It <i>staat</i> wid di tea,” di Hatter ansa.</p>
<p>“Of course twinkling staat wid a T!” di King seh sharply. “Yuh tek mi fi a dunce? Go on!”</p>
<p>“Mi a one poor man,” di Hatter seh, “an most tings twinkle afta dat—only di March Hare seh—”</p>
<p>“Mi neva!” di March Hare interrupt inna a great hurry.</p>
<p>“Yuh did!” di Hatter seh.</p>
<p>“Mi deny it!” seh di March Hare.</p>
<p>“Im deny it,” di King seh: “lef out dat deh part.”</p>
<p>“Well, at any rate, di Dormouse seh—” di Hatter goh on, a look anxiously round fi si if him woulda deny it too: but di Dormouse neva deny notn, being fast asleep.</p>
<p>“Afta dat,” di Hatter continued, “mi cut some more bread-an-butter—”</p>
<p>“But weh di Dormouse seh?” one a di jury dem ask.</p>
<p>“Dat mi cyan memba,” di Hatter seh.</p>
<p>“Yuh <i>haffi</i> memba,” di King seh, “or mi ago mek dem execute yuh.”</p>
<p>Di miserable Hatter drop him teacup an bread-an-butter, an go dung pan one knee. “Mi a wan puor man, yu Majesti,” im staat se.</p>
<p>“Yu a wan <i>uol iip</i> a puor <i>spiika</i> ,” di King se.</p>
<p>Yahso one a di guinea-pig dem did a cheer, an di officers dem a di court did a suppress dem immediately. (As dat a rather a hard word, mi ago jus explain to yuh how it did done. Dem did have a big canvas bag, weh did tie up a di mout wid strings: inna dis dem slip di guinea-pig, head first, an den sidong pan it.)</p>
<p>“Mi glad mi si dat done,” Alice tink. “Mi so often read inna di newspapers, at di end a di trials, “Dem did have some attempt at applause, weh did immediately suppressed by di officers a di court,” an mi neva andastan weh it mean til now.”</p>
<p>“If a dat yuh know bout it, yuh can stan dung,” di King kantinyu.</p>
<p>“Mi cyan go no lower,” seh di Hatter: “Mi deh pan di floor, as it deh.”</p>
<p>“Den yuh can <i>sidong</i> ,” di King ansa.</p>
<p>Yahso di ada guinea-pig cheer, an get suppress.</p>
<p>“Come, dat finish di guinea-pigs!” Alice did tink. “Now wi a go get on better.”</p>
<p>“Mi woulda radda finish mi tea,” di Hatter seh, wid a anxious look at di Queen, weh did a read di list a singers.</p>
<p>“Yuh can go,” seh di King, an di Hatter hurryly lef di court, widout even wait fi put him shoes on.</p>
<p>“—an jus tek him head off outside,” di Queen added to one a di officers: but di Hatter did out a sight before di officer coulda get to di door.</p>
<p>“Call di next witness!” di King seh.</p>
<p>Di neks witness was di Duchess's cook. Shi did a carry di pepper-box inna har han, an Alice guess who it was, even before she get inna di court, by di way di people dem weh did deh near di door staat sneeze all at once.</p>
<p>“Gi yuh evidence,” di King seh.</p>
<p>“Shan’t,” di cook seh.</p>
<p>Di King look anxiously pan di White Rabbit, weh seh inna a low voice, “Yuh Majesty haffi cross-examine <i>dis</i> witness.”</p>
<p>“Well, if mi haffi, mi haffi,” di King seh, wid a melancholy air, an, afta him fold him arms an frowning at di cook til him eyes dem did nearly out a sight, him seh inna a deep voice, “Weh dem mek outa tarts?”</p>
<p>“Pepper, mostly,” di cook seh.</p>
<p>“Treacle,” seh a sleepy voice behind har.</p>
<p>“Collar dat Dormouse,” di Queen shriek out. “Behead dat deh Dormouse! Turn dat deh Dormouse out a court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off wid him whiskers!”</p>
<p>Fi some minutes di whole court did inna confusion, a get di Dormouse turn out, an, by di time dem did settle dung again, di cook did disappear.</p>
<p>"Neva mine!" di King seh, wid a air a great relief. “Call di next witness.” An him add inna wan undertone to di Queen, “Really, mi dear, <i>yuh</i> haffi cross-examine di next witness. It quite mek mi forehead ache!”</p>
<p>Alice watch di White Rabbit as him fumble ova di list, feeling very curious fi si how di next witness woulda be, “—fi dem neva get much evidence <i>yet</i> ,” she seh to harself. Imagine har surprise, wen di White Rabbit read out, at di top a him shrill likkle voice, di name “Alice!”</p>
