<h2><a id="chap10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br/> Di Lobster Quadrille</h2>
<p>Di Mock Turtle sigh deeply, an draw di back a one flapper across him eyes. Im look pan Alice, an try fi taak, but fi a minute or two sobs choke im voice. “Same as if him did have a bone inna him throat,” seh di Gryphon: an it set to work shaking him an punch him inna di back. At last di Mock Turtle recover him voice, an, wid tears a run dung him cheeks, him go on again:—</p>
<p>“Yuh mait neva live much anda di sea—” (“Mi neva,” seh Alice)—“an maita yuh neva even introjuus tu a lobster—” (Alice staat se “Mi did ties wan taim—” bot shi chek harself hastily, an se “No, neva”) “—so yuh kyaahn av no aidiya weh a delightful ting a Lobster Quadrille!”</p>
<p>“No, indeed,” seh Alice. “Weh sort a dance it is?”</p>
<p>“Why,” seh di Gryphon, “yuh first form inna a line along di sea-shore—”</p>
<p>“Two lines!” di Mock Turtle did a baal out. “Siil, tortl, salmon, an soch; den, wen yu don klier aal a di jeli-fish outa di wie—”</p>
<p>“ <i>Dat</i> generally tek some time,” di Gryphon interrupted.</p>
<p>“—yuh advance twice—”</p>
<p>“Each wid a lobster as a partner!” di Gryphon did a baal out.</p>
<p>“Af course,” di Mock Turtle seh: “advance twice, set to partners—”</p>
<p>“—change lobsters, an retire inna di same order,” di Gryphon continued.</p>
<p>“Den, yuh know,” di Mock Turtle go on, “yuh throw di—”</p>
<p>“Di lobsters dem!” shout di Gryphon, wid a bound inna di air.</p>
<p>“—as far out to sea as yuh can—”</p>
<p>“Swim afta dem!” di Gryphon baal out.</p>
<p>“Turn a somersault inna di sea!” di Mock Turtle baal out, a capering wildly bout.</p>
<p>“Change lobsters again!” di Gryphon baal out pan di tap a it vais.</p>
<p>“Back to lan again, an dat a all di first figure,” seh di Mock Turtle, suddenly drop him voice; an di two creatures, weh did a jump bout like mad tings all dis time, sidong agen very sad an quiet, an look pon Alice.</p>
<p>“It mus be a very pretty dance,” seh Alice timidly.</p>
<p>“Yuh woulda like fi see a likkle a it?” di Mock Turtle seh.</p>
<p>“Very much indeed,” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“Kom, mek wi chrai di fos figa!” di Mock Turtle seh to di Gryphon. “Wi can do widout lobsters, yuh know. Which shall sing?”</p>
<p>“Oh, <i>yuh</i> sing,” di Gryphon seh. “Mi forget di words dem.”</p>
<p>So dem staat dance solemnly round an round Alice, every now an den a tread pan har toes wen dem pass too close, an a wave dem forepaws fi mark di time, while di Mock Turtle did a sing dis, very slow an sadly:—</p>
<p class="poem">“Yuh ago walk likkle faster?” seh a whiting to a snail.<br/> “A wan porpoise deh close behind wi, an him a tread pan mi tail.<br/> Si how eagerly di lobsters an di turtles dem all advance!<br/> Dem a wait pan di shingle—yuh wi come an jain di dance?<br/> Yuh ago, yuh naa go, yuh a go, yuh naa go, yuh ago jain di dance?<br/> Yuh ago, yuh naa go, yuh a go, yuh naa go, yuh naa go jain di dance?<br/><br/> “Yuh can really have no notion how delightful it ago be<br/> Wen dem tek wi op an fling wi, wid di lobsta dem, out a sii!”<br/> But di snail ansa seh “Too far, too far!” an gi a look askance—<br/> Said him tank di whiting kindly, but him neva waan join di dance.<br/> Wouldn't, couldn't, wouldn't, couldn't, wouldn't join di dance.<br/> Wouldn't, couldn't, wouldn't, couldn't, couldn't join di dance.<br/><br/> “Weh matta it how far wi go?” him scaly fren ansa.<br/> “A wan neda shore deh, yuh know, pan di ada side.<br/> Di further off fram England di nearer is to France—<br/> Den turn not pale, beloved snail, but come an join di dance.<br/> Yuh ago, yuh naa go, yuh a go, yuh naa go, yuh ago jain di dance?<br/> Yuh, yuh naa go, yuh, yuh naa go, yuh naa go jain di dance?”</p>
<p>“Tank yuh, a one very interesting dance fi watch,” seh Alice, feeling very glad seh it did ova at last: “an mi do so like dat deh curious song bout di whiting!”</p>
<p>“Oh, as to di whiting,” seh di Mock Turtle, “dem—yuh see dem, a course?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” seh Alice, “mi often si dem a dinn—” she check harself hastily.</p>
<p>“Mi nuh know weh Dinn maita deh,” di Mock Turtle seh, “but if yuh si dem so often, a course yuh know how dem look.”</p>
<p>“Mi believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “Dem av dem tiel iina dem mout — an dem ful op a krombl.”</p>
<p>“Yuh wrong bout di crumbs,” seh di Mock Turtle: “crumbs woulda all wash off inna di sea. But dem <i>have</i> dem tail inna dem mout; an di reason is—” yahso di Mock Turtle yawn an shet him eyes.—“Tell har bout di reason an all dat,” him seh to di Gryphon.</p>
<p>“Di riizn is,” seh di Gryphon, “seh dem <i>woulda</i> go wid di lobster dem to di dance. So dem get throw out to sea. So dem haffi fall a long way. So dem get dem tails fast inna dem mout. So dem couldn't get dem out again. A dat all.”</p>
<p>“Tank yuh,” Alice seh, “it very interesting. Mi neva know so much bout a whiting before.”</p>
<p>“Mi can tell yuh more dan dat, if yuh like,” di Gryphon seh. “Yuh know why dem call it a whiting?”</p>
<p>“Mi neva tink bout it,” Alice seh. "Wah mek?"</p>
<p>“ <i>It do di boots an shoes</i> ,” di Gryphon ansa very solemnly.</p>
<p>Alice did fully puzzled. “Du di boots an shoes dem!” she repeated inna a wondering tone.</p>
<p>“Why, weh <i>yuh</i> shoes dem done wid?” di Gryphon seh. “Mi mean, weh mek dem so shiny?”</p>
<p>Alice look dung pan dem, an consider likkle before she gi har ansa. “Dem don wid blak, mi biliiv.”</p>
<p>“Boots an shoes unda di sea,” di Gryphon seh inna a deep voice, “don wid a whiting. Now yuh know.”</p>
<p>“An weh dem mek outa?” Alice aks inna a tone a great curiosity.</p>
<p>“Soles an eels, a course,” di Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp coulda did tell yuh dat.”</p>
<p>“If mi did a di whiting,” seh Alice, whose thoughts did still a run pan di song, “mi woulda seh to di porpoise, 'Keep back, please: wi nuh waan <i>yuh</i> wid wi!'”</p>
<p>“Dem did oblige fi have him wid dem,” di Mock Turtle seh: “no wise fish woulda go noweh widout a porpoise.”</p>
<p>“It wudn really?” seh Alice inna a tone a great surprise.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” seh di Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish come to <i>mi</i> , an tell mi seh him a go a journey, mi shuda seh 'Wid weh porpoise?'”</p>
<p>“Yuh nuh mean 'purpose'?” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“Mi mean weh mi seh,” di Mock Turtle ansa inna wan ofended tone. An di Gryphon added “Come, mek wi hear some a <i>yuh</i> adventures.”</p>
<p>“Mi coulda tell yuh mi adventures—beginning fram dis morning,” seh Alice a likkle timidly: “but it no use fi go back to yesterday, cause mi was a different person den.”</p>
<p>“Explain all dat,” di Mock Turtle seh.</p>
<p>“No, no! Di adventures fos,” di Gryphon seh inna wan impatient tone: “explanations tek such a dreadful time.”</p>
<p>So Alice staat tel dem har adventures fram di time wen she fos si di White Rabbit. Shi did a likkle nervous bout it jus at first, di two creature dem get so close to har, one pan each side, an open dem eyes an mout so <i>very</i> wide, but she gain courage as she did a go on. Har listeners dem did perfectly quiet til she get to di part bout har repeating “ <i>Yuh old, Fada William</i> ,” to di Caterpillar, an di words dem all a come different, an den di Mock Turtle draw a long breath, an seh “Dat's very curious.”</p>
<p>“It's all bout as curious as it can be,” seh di Gryphon.</p>
<p>“It all come different!” di Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “Mi shuda like fi hear har try an repeat someting now. Tell har fi staat.” Im look pon di Gryphon as if im did tink it did have some kinda authority ova Alice.</p>
<p>“Stand up an repeat '' <i>Tis di voice a di sluggard</i> ,'” di Gryphon seh.</p>
<p>“How di creatures dem order one bout, an mek one repeat lessons!” Alice did tink; “Mi might as well deh a school at once.” However, she get up, an staat repeat it, but har head did so full a di Lobster Quadrille, dat she hardly know weh she did a seh, an di words dem did come very queer indeed:—</p>
<p class="poem">“'A di voice a di Lobster; mi hear him a seh,<br/> “Yuh bake mi too brown, mi haffi sugar mi hair.”<br/> As a duck wid it eyelids, so him wid him nose<br/> Trim him belt an him buttons, an turn out him toes.”<br/><br/> [later editions continue as follows<br/> Wen di sands all dry, him gay as a lark,<br/> An ago talk inna contemptuous tones a di Shark,<br/> But, wen di tide rise an sharks deh roun,<br/> Him voice have a timid an tremulous sound.]</p>
<p>“Dat difrent fram wa <i>mi</i> yuus tu se wen mi a pikni,” di Gryphon se.</p>
<p>“Well, mi neva hear it before,” seh di Mock Turtle; “but it sound uncommon nonsense.”</p>
<p>Alice neva seh notn; shi did sidong wid har face inna har han dem, a wanda if anyting woulda <i>eva</i> happen inna a natural way again.</p>
<p>“Mi shuda like fi get it explain,” di Mock Turtle seh.</p>
<p>“She cyaan explain it,” di Gryphon seh hastily. “Go on wid di next verse.”</p>
<p>“But bout him toes?” di Mock Turtle persist. “How him <i>coulda</i> turn dem out wid him nose, yuh know?”</p>
<p>“A di fos position inna dancing.” Alice seh; but did dreadfully puzzled by di whole ting, an did long fi change di subject.</p>
<p>“Go on wid di next verse,” di Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it staat ' <i>Mi pass by him garden</i> .'”</p>
<p>Alice neva dare fi disobey, though she did feel sure it woulda come wrong, an she go on inna a trembling voice:—</p>
<p class="poem">“Mi pass by him garden, an mark, wid one eye,<br/> How di Owl an di Panther did a share a pie—”<br/><br/> [later editions continue as follows<br/> Di Panther tek pie-crust, an gravy, an meat,<br/> While di Owl did have di dish as its share a di treat.<br/> Wen di pie did don, di Owl, as a boon,<br/> Dem did kindly permit fi pocket di spoon:<br/> While di Panther get knife an fork wid a growl,<br/> An don di banquet—]</p>
<p>“ <i>Weh</i> di use a repeating all dat deh stuff,” di Mock Turtle interrupted, “if yuh nuh explain it as yuh go on? A by far di most confusing ting <i>mi</i> eva hear!”</p>
<p>“Yes, mi tink yuh beta lef off,” di Gryphon seh: an Alice did only too glad fi do so.</p>
<p>“Wi fi try anodda figure a di Lobster Quadrille?” di Gryphon go on. “Ar yuh woulda like di Mock Turtle fi sing yuh a song?”</p>
<p>“Oh, a song, please, if di Mock Turtle woulda be so kind,” Alice replied, so eagerly dat di Gryphon seh, inna a rather offended tone, “Hm! No accounting fi tastes! Sing har ' <i>Turtle Soup</i> ,' yuh will, old fellow?”</p>
<p>Di Mock Turtle sigh deeply, an staat, inna a voice weh sometimes choked wid sobs, fi sing dis:—</p>
<p class="poem">“Beautiful Soup, so rich an green,<br/> Waiting inna a hot tureen!<br/> Who fi such dainties wouldn't stoop?<br/> Soup a di evening, beautiful Soup!<br/> Soup a di evening, beautiful Soup!<br/> Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!<br/> Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!<br/> Soo—oop a di e—e—evening,<br/> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!<br/><br/> “Beautiful Soup!Who care fi fish,<br/> Game, or any ada dish?<br/> Who wouldn't give all else fi two p<br/> ennyworth only a beautiful Soup?<br/> Pennyworth only a beautiful Soup?<br/> Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!<br/> Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!<br/> Soo—oop a di e—e—evening,<br/> Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”</p>
<p>“Chorus again!” di Gryphon baal out, an di Mock Turtle did jus staat repeat it, wen a cry a “Di trial's beginning!” did hear inna di distance.</p>
<p>"Cum aan!" di Gryphon baal out, an, tek Alice bai di han, it ron we, widout wiet fi di en a di sang.</p>
<p>“Weh trial it is?” Alice panted as she run; but di Gryphon only ansa “Come on!” an run di faster, while more an more faintly come, carrying on di breeze weh did a follow dem, di melancholy words:—</p>
<p class="poem">“Soo—oop a di e—e—evening,<br/> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”</p>
