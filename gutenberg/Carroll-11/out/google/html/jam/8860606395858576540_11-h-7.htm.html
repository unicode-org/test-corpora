<h2><a id="chap07"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br/> A Mad Tea-Party</h2>
<p>Deh did have a table set out unda a tree in front a di house, an di March Hare an di Hatter did a drink tea at it: a Dormouse did a sidong between dem, fast asleep, an di ada two did a use it as a cushion, a res dem elbows pan it, an a talk ova it head. “Very uncomfortable fi di Dormouse,” Alice did tink; “only, as it a sleep, mi suppose it nuh mind.”</p>
<p>Di tiebl did big, bot di chrii a dem did kroud tugeda a wan kona a it: “No ruum! No ruum!” dem baal out wen dem si Alice a kom. “ <i>Plenty</i> a room deh!” seh Alice indignantly, an she sidong inna a big arm-chair at one end a di table.</p>
<p>“Have some wine,” di March Hare seh inna an encouraging tone.</p>
<p>Alice look all roun di table, but nutten neva deh pan it but tea. “Mi nuh see no wine,” she remarked.</p>
<p>“Nobadi nuh deh deh,” di March Hare seh.</p>
<p>“Den it neva very civil a yuh fi offer it,” seh Alice angryly.</p>
<p>“It neva very civil a yuh fi sit dung widout being invited,” seh di March Hare.</p>
<p>“Mi neva know seh a <i>yuh</i> table,” seh Alice; “it laid fi a great many more dan three.”</p>
<p>“Yuh hair waan cut,” di Hatter seh. Im did a look pon Alice fi some time wid great curiosity, an dis was im first speech.</p>
<p>“Yuh shuda laan fi no mek no personal remarks,” Alice seh wid some severity; “it very rude.”</p>
<p>Di Hatter open him eyes very wide wen him hear dis; but all him <i>seh</i> was, “Why a raven is like a writing-desk?”</p>
<p>“Kom, wi a go have some fun now!” Alice did tink. “Mi glad dem staat ask riddles.—Mi believe mi can guess dat,” she added loud.</p>
<p>“Yuh mean seh yuh tink yuh can find out di ansa to it?” seh di March Hare.</p>
<p>“Exactly so,” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“Den yuh shuda seh weh yuh mean,” di March Hare goh on.</p>
<p>“Mi do,” Alice hastily ansa; “at least—at least mi mean weh mi seh—dat a di same ting, yuh know.”</p>
<p>“Not di same ting a bit!” di Hatter seh. “Yu maita jos se dat ‘Mi si wa mi iit’ a di siem ting laik ‘Mi iit wa mi si’!”</p>
<p>“Yuh might jus as well seh,” added di March Hare, “dat 'Mi like weh mi get' a di same ting as 'Mi get weh mi like'!”</p>
<p>“Yuh might jus as well seh,” added di Dormouse, who did look like him did a talk inna him sleep, “dat 'Mi breathe wen mi sleep' a di same ting as 'Mi sleep wen mi breathe'!”</p>
<p>“ <i>A</i> di same ting wid yuh,” di Hatter seh, an yahso di kanvasieshan drop, an di paati sidong kwaiyat fi a minit, wail Alice did a tingk uova aal we shi kuda memba bout raven an raitin-desk, weh neva nof.</p>
<p>Di Hatter was di first fi break di silence. “Weh day a di month?” him seh, turning to Alice: him did tek him watch outa him pocket, an did a look pan it uneasily, a shake it every now an den, an a hold it to him ear.</p>
<p>Alice tink bout a likkle, an den seh “Di fourth.”</p>
<p>“Two days wrong!” di Hatter baal out. “Mi tell yuh butter wouldn't suit di works!” him added looking angryly pon di March Hare.</p>
<p>“A did <i>di bes</i> butter,” di March Hare meekly replied.</p>
<p>“Yes, but some crumbs mus did get in as well,” di Hatter grumbled: “yuh shudn't put it in wid di bread-knife.”</p>
<p>Di March Hare tek di watch an look pon it gloomily: den him dip it inna him cup a tea, an look pon it again: but him coulda tink a nutten beta fi seh dan him first remark, “It was di <i>bes</i> butter, yuh know.”</p>
<p>Alice did a look ova him shoulda wid some curiosity. “Weh a funny watch!” she remarked. “It tel wi di die a di mont, an no tel wi a wa aklak it a!”</p>
<p>“Wa mek it fi?” di Hatter mutter. “ <i>Yuh</i> watch tell yuh weh year it is?”</p>
<p>“A no,” Alice ansa very readily: “but dat a because it stay di same year fi such a long time tugeda.”</p>
<p>“Weh a jus di case wid <i>mine</i> ,” seh di Hatter.</p>
<p>Alice did feel dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter's remark did look like it neva have no sort a meaning inna it, an yet it was certainly English. “Mi nuh quite andastan yuh,” she seh, as politely as she coulda.</p>
<p>“Di Dormouse a sleep again,” di Hatter seh, an him pour a likkle hot tea pan it nose.</p>
<p>Di Dormouse shake him head impatiently, an seh, widout opening him eyes, “Of course, of course; jus weh mi did a go remark miself.”</p>
<p>“Yuh don guess di riddle yet?” di Hatter seh, turning to Alice again.</p>
<p>“No, mi give it up,” Alice ansa: “weh di ansa?”</p>
<p>“Mi no have di slightest idea,” di Hatter seh.</p>
<p>“Nor mi,” di March Hare seh.</p>
<p>Alice sigh wearily. “Mi tink yuh might do someting betta wid di time,” she seh, “dan waste it inna ask riddles weh nuh have no ansa.”</p>
<p>“If yuh did know Time as well as mi,” seh di Hatter, “yuh wouldn't talk bout wasting <i>it</i> . <i>A him</i> .”</p>
<p>“Mi nuh know weh yuh mean,” Alice seh.</p>
<p>“Af kour yu no nuo!” di Hatter seh, a tossing him head contemptuously. “Mi dare seh yuh neva even talk to Time!”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but mi know mi haffi beat time wen mi learn music.”</p>
<p>“Ah! dat account fi it,” seh di Hatter. “Im naa go stan fi beat. Now, if yuh ongl kip aan gud terms wid im, im wuda du almost eniting yuh laik wid di clock. Fi egzampl, suppose it was nine o'clock inna di maanin, jos taim fi staat lesn: yuh woulda ongl haffi whisper a hint tu Time, an round go di clock inna a twinkling-half-past wan taim fi dina!”</p>
<p>(“Mi only wish it was,” di March Hare seh to itself inna a whisper.)</p>
<p>“Dat woulda be grand, certainly,” seh Alice thoughtfully: “but den—mi shudn't be hungry fi it, yuh know.”</p>
<p>“Not at first, perhaps,” seh di Hatter: “but yuh coulda keep it to half-past one as long as yuh did like.”</p>
<p>“A so <i>yuh</i> manage?” Alice ask.</p>
<p>Di Hatter shake him head mournfully. “Not mi!” him ansa. “We did a quarreled last March—jus before <i>him</i> did go mad, yuh know—” (pointing wid him tea spoon at di March Hare,) “—it was at di great concert weh di Queen of Hearts did gi, an mi did haffi sing</p>
<p class="poem">'Twinkle, twinkle, likkle bat!<br/> How mi wonder weh yuh deh at!'</p>
<p class="noindent">Yuh know di song, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“Mi hear someting like it,” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“It go on, yuh know,” di Hatter continued, “in dis way:—</p>
<p class="poem">'Up above di worl yuh fly,<br/> Like a tea-tray inna di sky.<br/> Twinkle, twinkle—'”</p>
<p>Yahso di Dormouse shiek itself, an staat sing inna it sliip “ <i>Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle</i> —” an go aan so lang dat dem did afi pinch it fi mek it stap.</p>
<p>“Well, mi did hardly finish di first verse,” seh di Hatter, “wen di Queen jump up an bawl out, 'Im a murder di time! Off wid him head!'”</p>
<p>“How dreadfully savage!” Alice baal out.</p>
<p>“An since dat,” di Hatter seh inna a mournful tone, “im naa go do a ting weh mi ask! A always six o'clock now.”</p>
<p>A bright idea come inna Alice head. “A dat mek so much tea-tings dem put out yah?” she ask.</p>
<p>“Yes, a dat,” di Hatter seh wid a sigh: “it always tea-time, an wi no have no time fi wash di tings between whiles.”</p>
<p>“Den yuh keep moving round, mi suppose?” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“Exactly so,” seh di Hatter: “as di tings dem get used up.”</p>
<p>“But weh happen wen yuh come to di beginning again?” Alice venture fi ask.</p>
<p>“Suppose wi change di subject,” di March Hare interrupt, yawning. “Mi a get taiyad a dis. Mi vuot di yong gyal tel wi wan tuori.”</p>
<p>“Mi fraid mi nuh know one,” seh Alice, radda alarmed at di proposal.</p>
<p>“Den di Dormouse shall!” dem both did a cry. “Wake up, Dormouse!” An dem pinch it pan di tuu saida wan taim.</p>
<p>Di Dormouse slowly open him eyes. “Mi neva did a sleep,” him seh inna a hoarse, feeble voice: “Mi hear every word weh unu did a seh.”</p>
<p>“Tell wi a story!” seh di March Hare.</p>
<p>“Yes, please do!” Alice beg.</p>
<p>“An be quick bout it,” added di Hatter, “or yuh wi be asleep again before it don.”</p>
<p>“Once upon a time deh did have three likkle sista,” di Dormouse staat inna a great hurry; “an dem niem a did Elsie, Lacie, an Tillie; an dem did liv a di batam a wahn wel—”</p>
<p>“Weh dem did a live pan?” seh Alice, weh always tek a great interest inna questions bout eating an drinking.</p>
<p>“Dem did live pan treacle,” di Dormouse seh, afta im tink a minute or two.</p>
<p>“Dem couldn't have do dat, yuh know,” Alice gently remarked; “dem woulda did sick.”</p>
<p>“So dem did deh,” di Dormouse seh; “ <i>very</i> ill.”</p>
<p>Alice try fi fancy to harself how such a extraordinary way a living woulda be, but it puzzle har too much, so she goh on: “But why dem did live at di bottom a one well?”</p>
<p>“Tek some more tea,” di March Hare seh to Alice, very earnestly.</p>
<p>“Mi neva have nutten yet,” Alice ansa inna wan ofended tone, “so mi cyan tek more.”</p>
<p>“Yuh mean yuh cyaan tek <i>less</i> ,” seh di Hatter: “it very easy fi tek <i>more</i> dan notn.”</p>
<p>“Nobody neva ask <i>yuh</i> opinion,” seh Alice.</p>
<p>“A who a mek personal remarks now?” di Hatter ask triumphantly.</p>
<p>Alice neva quite know weh fi seh to dis: so she help harself wid some tea an bread-an-butter, an den ton to di Dormouse, an repeat har kweschan. “Why dem did live a di bottom a one well?”</p>
<p>Di Dormouse tek a minute or two fi tink bout it, an den seh, “It was a treacle-well.”</p>
<p>“No such ting nuh deh!” Alice did staat beks, but di Hatter an di March Hare seh “Sh! sh!” an di Dormouse sulkily remarked, “If yuh can't be civil, yuh woulda better finish di story fi yuhself.”</p>
<p>“No, please go on!” Alice seh very humbly; “Mi naa go interrupt again. Mi dare seh it may be <i>one</i> .”</p>
<p>“One, indeed!” di Dormouse seh indignantly. However, him did agree fi go on. “An so dem three likkle sista yah—dem did a laan fi draw, yuh know—”</p>
<p>“Weh dem did draw?” seh Alice, quite forget har promise.</p>
<p>“Treacle,” di Dormouse seh, widout considering at all dis time.</p>
<p>“Mi waan a clean cup,” di Hatter interrupt: “mek wi all move one place on.”</p>
<p>Im move on as im did a taak, an di Dormouse fala im: di March Hare move inna di Dormouse's place, an Alice rather unwillingly tek di place a di March Hare. Di Hatter was di only one weh get any advantage fram di change: an Alice was a good deal worse off dan before, as di March Hare did jus upset di milk-jug inna him plate.</p>
<p>Alice neva waan offen di Dormouse agen, so she staat very cautiously: “But mi nuh andastan. Weh dem did draw di treacle fram?”</p>
<p>“Yuh can draw wata outa a water-well,” seh di Hatter; “so mi shuda tink yuh coulda draw treacle outa a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”</p>
<p>“But dem did deh <i>inna</i> di well,” Alice seh to di Dormouse, an neva choose fi notice dis last remark.</p>
<p>“Af course dem did deh,” di Dormouse seh; “—well in.”</p>
<p>Dis ansa so confused poor Alice, dat she mek di Dormouse go on fi some time widout interrupting it.</p>
<p>“Dem did a laan fi draw,” di Dormouse seh, a yawn an a rub it yai dem, kaa it did a get very sleepy; “an dem draw all manner a tings—everyting weh staat wid a M—”</p>
<p>“Why wid an M?” seh Alice.</p>
<p>"Wah mek?" seh di March Hare.</p>
<p>Alice did silent.</p>
<p>Di Dormouse did close it eyes by dis time, an did a goh off inna a doze; but, wen di Hatter pinch it, it wake up again wid a likkle shriek, an goh on: “—dat staat wid an M, such as mouse-traps, an di moon, an memory, an muchness—yuh know yuh seh tings a “much a muchness”—did yuh eva see such a ting as a drawing of a muchness?”</p>
<p>“Really, now yuh ask mi,” seh Alice, very much confused, “mi nuh tink—”</p>
<p>“Den yuh shudn't talk,” di Hatter seh.</p>
<p>Dis piece a rudeness was more dan Alice coulda bear: she get up inna great disgust, an walk weh; di Dormouse fall asleep instantly, an non a di ada ones dem neva tek di least notice a har going, though she look back once or twice, half hoping seh dem woulda call afta har: di last time she see dem, dem did a try put di Dormouse inna di teapot.</p>
<p>“At any rate mi naa go eva go <i>deh</i> agen!” seh Alice as she pick har way thru di wood. “A di stupides tii-paati mi eva go ina aal mi laif!”</p>
<p>Jus as she did a seh dis, she notice seh one a di trees dem did have a door weh did a lead right inna it. “Dat very curious!” shi did tink. “But everyting curious today. Mi tink mi may as well go in at once.” An shi go iin.</p>
<p>Once more she find harself inna di long hall, an close to di likkle glass table. “Nou, mi wi manij beta dis taim,” shi se tu arself, an staat bai tek di likl guol kii, an uopm di duor we liid inna di gyaadn. Den shi go a work a nibbling pan di mushroom (shi did kip a piece a it inna har pocket) til shi did bout a foot high: den shi walk dung di likkle passage: an <i>den</i> —shi fain harself at last inna di beautiful garden, mongst di bright flower-beds an di cool fountains.</p>
