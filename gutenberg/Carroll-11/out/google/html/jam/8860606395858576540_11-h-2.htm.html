<h2><a id="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II.<br/> Di Pool a Tears</h2>
<p>“Curiouser an curiouser!” cried Alice (she did so much surprised, dat fi di moment she quite forget how fi speak good English); “now mi a open out like di largest telescope weh eva deh! Good-bye, feet!” (kaaz wen shi luk dong pan ar fut dem, dem did luk laik dem did aalmuos outa sait, dem did a get so faar aaf). “Oh, mi puor likl fut dem, mi wanda uu ago put aan yu schuuz an staakin fi yu nou, dier dem? Mi shuor se <i>mi</i> naa go kyahn! Mi ago de tuu faar fi chrobl miself bout yu: yu afi manij di bes wie yu kyan;—bot mi afi bi kain tu dem,” Alice tingk, “ar maita dem naa go waak di wie mi naa go: Lek mi gi mi! dem a new pair a boots every Christmas.”</p>
<p>An shi gwaan plan tu arself ou shi a go manij it. “Dem haffi go by di carrier,” she did tink; “an ou foni it a-go luk, fi sen prezent tu yu uona fut! An ou aad di dairekshan dem a-go luk!</p>
<div class="pgmonospaced"><i>Alice's Right Foot, Esq.,<br/> Hearthrug,<br/> near di Fender,</i> ( <i>wid Alice's love</i> ).<br/></div>
<p class="noindent">Oh dear, weh nonsense mi a talk!”</p>
<p>Jus den har head hit gens di roof a di hall: in fact she did now more dan nine feet high, an she at once tek up di likkle golden key an hurry off to di garden door.</p>
<p>Poor Alice! A did as much as she coulda do, lay dung pan one side, fi look thru inna di garden wid one eye; but fi get chruu was more hopeless dan eva: she sit dung an staat cry again.</p>
<p>“Yuh fi shame a yuhself,” seh Alice, “a great girl like yuh,” (she might well seh dis), “fi go on cry inna dis way! Stop dis moment, mi tell yuh!” But she did a gwaan all di same, shedding gallons a tears, until deh did have a big pool all roun har, bout four inches deep an reaching half dung di hall.</p>
<p>Afta a time she hear a likkle pattering a foot inna di distance, an she hastily dry har eyes fi see weh did a come. A did di White Rabbit weh did a come back, splendidly dressed, wid a pair a white kid gloves inna one han an a big fan inna di ada one: him come a trotting along inna a great hurry, a mutter to himself as him come, “Oh! di Duchess, di Duchess! Oh! she naa go be savage if mi did a keep har waiting!” Alice did feel so desperate dat she did ready fi ask help a any one; so, wen di Rabbit come near har, she staat, inna a low, timid voice, “If yuh please, sir—” Di Rabbit staat violently, drop di white kid gloves an di fan, an skurrie weh inna di darkness as hard as him coulda go.</p>
<p>Alice tek op di fan an di gloves dem, an, as di hall did very hot, shi kip aan a fan arself aal di taim shi did a gwaan taak: “Dear, dear! How queer everyting is to-day! An yesterday tings go on jus as usual. Mi wanda if mi did change inna di night? Mek mi tink: was mi di same wen mi get up dis morning? Mi can memba feel a likkle different. Mi no di same, di neks kweschan a, A <i>uu</i> inna di worl mi bi? An shi staat tingk uova aal a di pikni dem we shi nuo we a di siem iej laik arself, fi si ef shi kuda did chienj fi eni a dem.</p>
<p>“Mi sure mi a nuh Ada,” she seh, “cause har hair go inna such long ringlets, an mine nuh go inna ringlets at all; an mi sure mi cyan be Mabel, cause mi know all sorts a tings, an she, oh! she know such a very likkle! Besides, <i>she a</i> she, an mi a mi, an—oh how it is all mi try <i>fi know</i> ! tings mi use to know: four times five is twelve, an four times six is thirteen, an four times seven is—oh dear <i>!</i> Mi mus did change fi Mabel! Mi ago try an seh ' <i>How doth di likkle</i> —'” an she cross har han dem pan har lap as if she did a seh lessons, an staat repeat it, but har voice did sound hoarse an strange, an di words dem neva come di same as dem use to do:—</p>
<p class="poem">“How doth di likkle crocodile<br/> Improve him shining tail,<br/> An puor out di waata fram di Nail Riva<br/> Pan every golden scale!<br/><br/> “How cheerfully him look like him a grin,<br/> How neatly spread him claws,<br/> An welkom likl fish dem inna<br/> Wid gently smiling jaws!”</p>
<p>“Mi sure dem a nuh di right words,” seh poor Alice, an har eyes dem full a tears again as she goh on, “Mi mus be Mabel afta all, an mi shall haffi go an live inna dat deh poky likkle house, an have next to no toys fi play wid, an oh! ever so many lessons fi learn! No, mi don mek up mi mind bout it if mi deh dung Mabel; It naa go mek no sens dem put dong dem ed an se 'Kom op agen, dier!' Mi ago only look up an seh 'A who mi is den? Tell mi dat first, an den, if mi like being dat deh person, mi ago come up: if not, mi ago stay dung yah til mi a somebody else'—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, wid a sudden burst a tears, “Mi do wish dem <i>woulda</i> put dem head dung! Mi so <i>very</i> tired a deh all alone yah!”</p>
<p>Az shi se dis shi luk dong pan ar an dem, an shi did sopraiz fi si se shi did put aan wan a di Rabit likl wait pikni glov dem wail shi did a taak. “How mi <i>coulda</i> do dat?” shi did tink. “Mi mus be growing small again.” Shi get op an go a di tiebl fi meja arself bai it, an fain se, az nier az shi kuda ges, shi did nou bout tuu fut ai, an did a go aan a shrink rapid-rapid: shi suun fain out se di kaaz a dis a di fan we shi did a uol, an shi jrap it hasti, jos ina taim fi avoid shrink we aaltogeda.</p>
<p>“Dat <i>was</i> a narrow escape!” seh Alice, a good deal fraiten at di sudden change, but very glad fi find harself still inna existence; “an now fi di garden!” an she run wid all speed back to di likkle door: but, alas! di likl duor did shet agen, an di likl guol kii did a lidong pan di glaas tiebl laik bifuo, “an tingz wos dan eva,” di puor pikni tingk, “kaaz mi neva so likl laik dis bifuo, neva! An mi diklare se it tuu bad, dat it so!”</p>
<p>As she seh dem words deh har foot slip, an inna anodda moment, splash! shi did deh up to har chin inna salt water. Har first idea was dat she did somehow fall inna di sea, “an inna dat deh case mi can go back by railway,” she seh to harself. (Alice did go a di seaside once inna har life, an shi did come to di general conclusion, seh weh yuh go pan di English coast yuh find a nomba a bathing machine dem inna di sea, some pickney dem a dig inna di sand wid wooden spades, den a row a lodging houses, an behind dem a railway station.) However, she soon mek out seh she did a tears inna di pool wen she did a sept wen she did a cry. nine feet high.</p>
<p>“Mi wish mi neva baal so moch!” seh Alice, as she swim bout, a try find har way out. “Mi ago get ponish fi it now, mi suppose, by being drowned inna mi own tears! Dat <i>ago</i> be a queer ting, fi be sure! However, everyting queer to-day.”</p>
<p>Jus den she hear someting splash bout inna di pool a likkle way off, an she swim nearer fi mek out weh it was: at first she did tink it mosi a walrus or hipopotamus, but den she memba how small she was now, an she soon mek out seh a did only a mouse weh did slip in like harself.</p>
<p>“It woulda be a any use, now,” thought Alice, “fi speak to dis mouse? Everyting so out-of-the-way dung yah, dat mi shuda tink very likely it can talk: at any rate, nuh harm deh inna trying.” So she staat: “O Mouse, yuh know di way outa dis pool? Mi very tired a swim bout yah, O Mouse!” (Alice did tink dis mus be di right way fi speak to a mouse: she neva do such a ting before, but she memba seh she did see inna har bredda Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) Di Mouse look at har rada inquisitively, an it did look like she did a wink wid one a its eyes but notn neva seh.</p>
<p>“Maitbi it no andastan Ingglish,” Alice tingk; “Mi daresay a French mouse, come ova wid William di Conqueror.” (For, wid all har knowledge a history, Alice neva have no very clear notion how long ago anyting did happen.) So she staat again: “Où est ma chatte?” weh was di first sentence inna har French lesson-book. Di Mouse gi a sudden leap outa di wata, an did look like him did a quiver all ova wid fright. “Oh, mi beg yuh pardon!” cried Alice hastily, fraid seh she did hurt di poor animal feelings. “Mi quite forget yuh neva like cats.”</p>
<p>“Not like cats!” di Mouse baal out, inna a shrill, passionate voice. “ <i>Yuh</i> woulda like cats if yuh was mi?”</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps not,” seh Alice inna a soothing tone: “don't be angry bout it. An yet mi wish mi coulda show yuh wi cat Dinah: Mi tink yuh woulda tek a fancy to cats if yuh coulda only see har. Shi a such a dear quiet ting,” Alice goh on, half to harself, as she swim lazily bout inna di pool, “an shi pur, so sire by di fire licking har paws an wash har face—an she a such a nice soft ting fi nurse—an she a such a capital one fi catch mice—oh, mi beg yuh pardon!” cried Alice again, fi dis time di Mouse did a bristle all ova, an she did feel certain it mus be really offend. “Wi naa go talk bout har no more if yuh radda nuh.”</p>
<p>“Wi indeed!” di Mouse did a baal out, weh did a tremble dung to di end a him tail. “As if <i>mi</i> woulda talk pan such a subject! Wi family always <i>did hate</i> cats: nasty, low, vulgar tings! No mek mi hear di name again!”</p>
<p>“Mi naa go du dat fi chruu!” seh Alice, inna a great hurry fi change di subject a conversation. “Yuh—yuh lov—dog?” Di Mouse neva ansa, so Alice goh aan eagerly: “A such a nice likkle dog deh near wi yaad mi shuda like fi show yuh! A likkle bright-eyed terrier, yuh know, wid oh, such long curly brown hair! An it ago fetch tings wen yuh throw dem, an it ago sidong op an beg fi it dinner, an all sort a tings—mi cyan memba—an it halflong—an to a farmer, yuh know, an him seh it so useful, it worth a hundred pounds Him seh it kill all di rats an—oh dear!” Alice baal out inna a sorryful tone, “Mi fried mi ofend it agen!” For di Mouse did a swim weh fram har as hard as it coulda go, an a mek quite a commotion inna di pool as it did a go.</p>
<p>So shi kaal saaf afta it, “Mous dier! Du kom bak agen, an wi naa go taak bout pus ar daag niida, ef yu no laik dem!” Wen di Mouse hear dis, it turn roun an swim slowly back to har: it face did quite pale (wid passion, Alice did tink), an it seh inna a low trembling voice, “Mek wi get to di shore, an den mi ago tell yuh mi history, an yuh wi andastan why it is mi hate cats an dogs.”</p>
<p>A did high time fi go, cause di pool did a get quite crowded wid di birds an animals dem weh did fall inna it: deh did have a Duck an a Dodo, a Lory an a Eaglet, an several ada curious creatures. Alice did a lead di way, an di whole party swim to di shore.</p>
