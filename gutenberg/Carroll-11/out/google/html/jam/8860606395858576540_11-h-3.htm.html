<h2><a id="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III.<br/> A Caucus-Race an a Long Tale</h2>
<p>Dem was indeed a queer-looking party weh did a assemble pan di bank—di birds wid draggled feathers, di animals wid dem fur clinging close to dem, an all dripping wet, cross, an uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Di fos kweschan a course was, how fi get dry again: dem did have a consultation bout dis, an afta a few minutes it did look quite natural to Alice fi find harself a talk familiarly wid dem, as if she did know dem all har life. Indeed, she did have a long argument wid di Lory, who at last turn sulky, an woulda only seh, “Mi older dan yuh, an mus know betta;” an dis Alice wouldn't allow widout knowing how old it was, an, as di Lory positively refuse fi tell it age, deh neva have no more fi seh.</p>
<p>At laas di Muos, uu did luk laik im a wan man we av powa mongks dem, kaal out, “Sidong, aal a unu, an lisn tu mi! <i>Mi</i> suun mek unu jrai inof!” Dem all sidong at once, inna one big ring, wid di Mouse inna di middle. Alice kip har eyes anxiously fixed pan it, fi she did feel sure she woulda ketch a bad cold if she neva get dry very soon.</p>
<p>“Ahem!” di Mouse seh wid a important air, “unu all ready? Dis a di driest ting mi know. Silence all round, if yuh please! 'William di Conqueror, whose cause did favored by di pope, did soon submit to by di English, who did waan leaders, an did a late much accustomed to usurpation an conquest, and Morcarls, and Morcarls of North'”</p>
<p>“Ugh!” seh di Lory, wid a shiver.</p>
<p>“Mi a beg yuh pardon!” di Mouse seh, frown, but very politely: “Yuh did a taak?”</p>
<p>“Not mi!” seh di Lory hastily.</p>
<p>“Mi did tink yuh did,” di Mouse seh. “—Mi proceed. 'Edwin an Morcar, di earls a Mercia an Northumbria, did declare fi him: an even Stigand, di patriotic archbishop a Canterbury, did find it advisable—'”</p>
<p>“Yuh find <i>weh</i> ?” seh di Duck.</p>
<p>“Found <i>it</i> ,” di Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course yuh know weh 'it' mean.”</p>
<p>“Mi know weh 'it' mean well enough, wen <i>mi</i> find a ting,” seh di Duck: “it's generally a frog or a worm. Di kweschan is, weh di archbishop find?”</p>
<p>Di Mouse neva notice dis kweschan, but hurriedly go on, “'—found it advisable fi go wid Edgar Atheling fi meet William an offer him di crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But di insolence a him Normans—' How yuh a get on now, mi dear?” it continue, turning to Alice as it did a talk.</p>
<p>“As wet as ever,” seh Alice inna a melancholy tone: “it nuh look like it a dry mi at all.”</p>
<p>“Inna dat deh case,” di Dodo seh solemnly, rising to it foot, “mi move dat di meeting adjourn, fi di immediate adoption a more energetic remedies—”</p>
<p>“Speak English!” seh di Eaglet. “Mi nuh know di meaning a half a dem long word deh, an, weh more, mi nuh believe yuh know either!” An di Iiglet ben dong im ed fi aid im smadi: som a di ada bod dem did a tiit aadibl.</p>
<p>“Weh mi did a go seh,” di Dodo seh inna wan ofended tone, “was, dat di bes ting fi get wi dry woulda be a Caucus-race.”</p>
<p>“ <i>Weh</i> a Caucus-race?” seh Alice; not dat she did waan much fi know, but di Dodo did pause as if it did tink seh <i>somebody</i> shuda speak, an nobadi else did a look fi seh nutten.</p>
<p>“Why,” di Dodo seh, “di bes way fi explain it is fi do it.” (An, as yuh might like fi try di ting yuhself, some winta day, mi ago tell yuh how di Dodo manage it.)</p>
<p>Fos it mark out a race-course, inna a sort a circle, (“di exact shape nuh matta,” it seh,) an den all di party dem did put along di course, yah an deh. No “Wan, tuu, chrii, an we” neva de de, bot dem staat ron wen dem waahn, an lef aaf wen dem waahn, so it neva iizi fi nuo wen di ries don. However, wen dem did a run half an hour or so, an dem did quite dry again, di Dodo suddenly call out “Di race don!” an dem all crowd roun it, a pant, an a ask, “Bot who win?”</p>
<p>Dis kweschan di Dodo kudn ansa widout a big tingkin, an it sidong fi a lang taim wid wan finga pres pan im forehead (di pozishan we yu yuus tu si Shakespeare, ina di pikcha dem a im), wail di res a wiet ina sailens. At last di Dodo seh, “ <i>Everybody</i> win, an all haffi have prizes.”</p>
<p>“Bot a uu fi gi di praiz dem?” quite a chorus a voices ask.</p>
<p>“Why, <i>she</i> , a course,” seh di Dodo, pointing to Alice wid one finga; an di whole party at once crowd roun har, a call out inna a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”</p>
<p>Alice neva have no idea weh fi do, an inna despair she put har han inna har pocket, an pull out a box a comfits, (luckily di salt water neva get inna it), an gi dem round as prizes. A did exactly one a-piece, all round.</p>
<p>“Bot shi afi av wahn praiz arself, yu nuo,” di Mous se.</p>
<p>“Af course,” di Dodo ansa very gravely. “Weh else yuh have inna yuh pocket?” him goh on, turning to Alice.</p>
<p>“Only a thimble,” seh Alice sadly.</p>
<p>“Hand it ova yah,” di Dodo seh.</p>
<p>Den dem all crowd roun har once more, while di Dodo solemnly present di thimble, an seh “We beg yuh acceptance a dis elegant thimble;” an, wen it did don dis short speech, dem all cheer.</p>
<p>Alice did tink di whole ting very absurd, but dem all did look so grave dat she neva dare fi laugh; an, as she couldn't tink a nutten fi seh, she simply bow, an tek di thimble, looking as solemn as she could.</p>
<p>Di neks ting was fi eat di comfits: dis did cause some noise an confusion, as di big birds dem did a complain seh dem couldn't taste dem own, an di likkle ones dem did a choke an dem did haffi get pat pan di back. However, it did ova at last, an dem did sidong again inna a ring, an beg di Mouse fi tell dem someting more.</p>
<p>“Yuh did promise fi tell mi yuh history, yuh know,” seh Alice, “an why it is yuh hate—C an D,” she added inna a whisper, half fraid seh it woulda be offended again.</p>
<p>“Mine a one long an a sad tale!” di Mouse seh, turning to Alice, an sigh.</p>
<p>“ <i>A</i> one long tail, certainly,” seh Alice, looking dung wid wonder at di Mouse's tail; “but why yuh call it sad?” An shi kip aan a puzzle bout it wail di Mouse did a taak, so dat har idea a di tale was someting like dis:—</p>
<div class="pgmonospaced">“Fury seh to a<br/> mouse, Dat him<br/> meet inna di<br/> owse,<br/> 'Mek wi<br/> both go to<br/> law: <i>Mi</i> will<br/> prosecute<br/> <i>yuh</i> .—Come,<br/> Mi naa go tek no<br/> denial; Wi<br/> mus have a<br/> trial: Fi<br/> really dis<br/> maanin mi have<br/> nutn<br/> fi do.'<br/> Di<br/> mouse to di<br/> cur, 'Such<br/> a trial,<br/> Dear Sah,<br/> Wid<br/> no jury<br/> or judge,<br/> woulda be<br/> wasting<br/> fi wi<br/> bret.'<br/> 'Mi ago be<br/> judge, mi ago<br/> be jury,'<br/> Say<br/> tricky tricky<br/> old Fury:<br/> 'Sick<br/> try di<br/> hola<br/> cuz,<br/> an<br/> condemn<br/> yuh<br/> tuh<br/> det.'"<br/></div>
<p>“Yuh naa go!” di Mouse seh to Alice severely. “Weh yuh a tink bout?”</p>
<p>“Mi beg yuh pardon,” seh Alice very humbly: “yuh did get to di fifth bend, mi tink?”</p>
<p>“Mi <i>neva!</i> ” di Mouse baal out, shaap an wel beks.</p>
<p>“A knot!” seh Alice, always ready fi mek harself useful, an a look anxiously bout har. “Oh, do mek mi help fi undo it!”</p>
<p>“Mi naa go do nutten a di sort,” di Mouse seh, get up an walk weh. “Yuh insult mi by talking such nonsense!”</p>
<p>“Mi neva mean it!” puor Alice beg. “Bot yu so iizi fi get beks, yu nuo!”</p>
<p>Di Mouse only growled in reply.</p>
<p>“Please come back an finish yuh story!” Alice call afta it; an di ada ones dem all join inna chorus, “Yes, please do!” but di Mouse only shake him head impatiently, an walk a likkle quicker.</p>
<p>“Wat a pity it wouldn't stay!” di Lory sigh, as soon as it did quite out of sight; an wan uol Krab tek di chaans fi se tu ar daata “Ah, mi dier! Mek dis bi wahn lesn tu yu fi neva luuz <i>yu</i> tempa!” “Hold yuh tongue, Ma!” di young Crab seh, a likkle snappishly. “Yuh inof fi try di patience a one oyster!”</p>
<p>“Mi wish mi did have wi Dinah yah, mi know mi do!” seh Alice loud, an neva did a address nobody in particular. “She woulda soon fetch it back!”</p>
<p>“An who is Dinah, if mi might venture fi ask di kweschan?” di Lory seh.</p>
<p>Alice reply eagerly, for she did always ready fi talk bout har pet: “Dinah a fi wi cat. An she a such a capital one fi ketch mice yuh cyaan tink! An oh, mi wish yuh coulda see har afta di birds! Why, she ago eat a likkle bird as soon as look pon it!”</p>
<p>Dis speech cause a remarkable sensation mongst di party. Som a di bod dem hurried off at once: one ole Magpie staat wrap up himself very carefully, remarking, “Mi really must be getting home; di night-air nuh suit mi throat!” an wan Kyanieri kaal out iina wan vais a chrimbl tu im pikni dem, “Kom we, mi bwai pikni dem, a taim nou aal a unu go iina bed!” Pan various pretexts dem all move off, an Alice did soon lef alone.</p>
<p>“Mi wish mi neva mention Dinah!” she seh to harself inna a melancholy tone. “Nobody look like har, dung yah, an mi sure she a di bes cat inna di worl! Oh, mi dear Dinah! Mi wonder if mi shall eva see yuh no more!” An yahso poor Alice staat cry again, cause she did feel very lonely an low-spirited. Inna a likkle while, however, she again hear a likkle pattering a footsteps inna di distance, an she look up eagerly, half hoping seh di Mouse did change him mind, an did a come back fi finish him story.</p>
