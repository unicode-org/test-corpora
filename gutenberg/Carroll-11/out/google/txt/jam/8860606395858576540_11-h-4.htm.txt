CHAPTER IV. Di Rabbit sen iin a likl bil

A did di White Rabbit, a did a trot slow back again, an a look anxiously bout as it did a go, as if it did lost someting; an shi hear it a mutter to itself “Di Duchess! Di Duchess! Oh mi dear paws! Oh mi fur an whiskers! She ago get mi executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Weh mi can did drop dem, mi wonder?” Alice guess inna a moment seh it did a look fi di fan an di pair a white kid gloves, an she very good-naturedly staat hunt bout fi dem, but dem neva deh noweh fi be seen—everyting did look like it did change since she swim inna di pool, an di great hall, wid di glass table an di likkle door, did vanish completely.

Very soon di Rabbit notice Alice, as she did a go hunt bout, an call out to har inna an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, weh yuh a duh out yah? Run home dis moment, an fetch mi a pair a gloves an a fan! Quick, now!” An Alice did so fraid dat she run weh at once inna di direction weh it did a point to, widout trying fi explain di mistake it did mek.

“Im tek mi fi im housemaid,” shi se tu arself az shi ron. “Im a-go shak wen im fain out uu mi bi, bot mi beta tek im fan an im glov dem — dat miin se, ef mi kyan fain dem.” As she did a seh dis, she come upon a neat likkle house, pan di door a weh did have a bright brass plate wid di name “W. RABBIT,” engrave pan it. Shi go in widout knock, an hurry upstairs, inna great fear less she woulda meet di real Mary Ann, an get turn out a di house before she did find di fan an gloves.

“How queer it look,” Alice seh to harself, “fi be going messages fi a rabbit! Mi suppose Dinah'll be send mi on messages next!” An shi staat fansi di sortn ting we wuda apm: “'Mis Alice! Kom ya dairek, an get redi fi yu waak!' 'Coming in a minute, nurse! But mi haffi see seh di mouse nuh get out.' Ongl mi no tink,” Alice go aan, “dat dem wuda mek Dinah stap inna di ous if it staat aada piipl bout laik dat!”

By dis time she did find har way inna a tidy likkle room wid a table inna di window, an pan it (as she did a hope) a fan an two or three pairs a tiny white kid gloves: she tek up di fan an a pair a di gloves, an did jus a go lef di room, wen har eye fall pan a likkle bottle weh did a stan up near di looking-glass. No label neva deh deh dis time wid di words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncork it an put it to har lips. “Mi nuo se sitn inchrestin shuor fi apm,” shi se tu arself.

It did so indeed, an much sooner dan she did expect: before she did drink half di bottle, she find har head press against di ceiling, an had to stoop fi save har neck fram get broken. Shi put dong di bottle hastily, an seh to harself “Dat a quite enough—mi hope mi naa go grow no more—As it is, mi cyan get out a di door—mi do wish mi neva did drunk quite so much!”

Alas! it did too late fi wish dat! Shi did a gwaan grow, an grow, an very soon shi did haffi kneel dung pan di floor: inna anodda minute deh neva even room fi dis, an shi did a try di effect a lying dung wid one elbow against di door, an di ada arm curl roun har head. Stil shi gwaan gruo, an, az a laas risorch, shi put wan arm outa di winda, an wan fut op di chimini, an se tu arself “Nou mi kyaahn du no muor, weda apm. Weh ago apm tu mi?”

Luckily fi Alice, di likkle magic bottle did have it full effect now, an she neva grow no larger: still it did very uncomfortable, an, as it did look like no sort a chance neva deh fi har eva get outa di room again, no wonder she did feel unhappy.

“It did more pleaser at home,” did tink poor Alice, “wen one neva always did a grow larger an smaller, an being ordered bout by mice an rabbits. Mi almost wish mi neva did go dung deh rabbit-hole—an yet—an yet—it's rather curious, yuh know, dis sort a life! Mi do wonder weh coulda happen to mi used to read fairy, fairyles! fancied dat kain a ting neva happen, an now yah mi deh inna di middle a one! Deh shuda have a book write bout mi, dat deh ought! An wen mi grow up, mi ago write one—but mi grow up now,” she added inna a sorrowful tone; “at least no room nuh deh fi grow up no more yah .”

“Bot den,” Alice tingk, “mi neva get no uol dan mi nou? Dat wi bi wahn komfort, wan wie—neva fi bi wahn uol uman—bot den—aalwiez fi av lesn fi laan! Oh, mi shudn laik dat! ”

“Oh, yuh foolish Alice!” she ansa harself. “How yuh fi laan lessons inna yah? Why, a hardly room nuh deh fi yuh , an no room at all fi no lesson-books!”

An so shi go aan, tek fos wan saida an den di neks wan, an mek a gud kanvasieshan bout it aaltogeda; but afta a few minutes she hear a voice outside, an stop fi listen.

“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” di voice seh. “Fetch mi gloves dis moment!” Den a likkle pattering a foot pan di stairs kom. Alice did know seh a di Rabbit did a come fi look fi har, an shi did a tremble til shi did a shake di house, quite forgetting seh she did bout a thousand times as big as di Rabbit, an she neva have no reason fi be afraid a it.

Presently di Rabbit come up to di door, an try fi open it; but, as di door did open inwards, an Alice's elbow did press hard against it, dat deh attempt prove a failure. Alice hear it seh to itself “Den mi ago go round an get inna di window.”

“ Dat yuh naa go!” Alice did tink, an, afta shi did a wait til shi did a fansi se shi did ier di Rabbit jos anda di winda, shi suddenli spread out har han, an mek a snatch inna di ier. Shi neva get hold a nutten, but shi hear a likkle shriek an a fall, an a crash a broken glass, fram weh shi conclude seh it was jus possible it did fall inna a cucumber-frame, or someting a di sort.

Next come an angry voice—di Rabbit's—“Pat! Pat! Weh yuh deh?” An den a voice she neva hear before, “Sure den mi deh yah! Dig fi apples, yer honour!”

“Digging fi apples, indeed!” di Rabbit seh beks. “Yah! Come an help mi outa dis! ” (Sounds a more broken glass.)

“Nou tel mi, Pat, we de ina di winda?”

“Sure, a one arm, yer honour!” (Im pronounce it “arrum.”)

“An arm, yuh goose! Who eva si one dat deh size? Why, it full di whole window!”

“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm fi all dat.”

“Well, it no have no business deh, at any rate: go tek it weh!”

A did a long silence afta dis, an Alice coulda only hear whispers now an den; such as, “Sure, mi nuh like it, yer honour, at all, at all!” “Du weh mi tell yuh, yuh coward!” an at last she spread out har han again, an mek anodda snatch inna di air. Dis time deh did have two likkle shrieks, an more sound a broken glass. “Weh a numba a cucumber-frames deh mosi deh!” Alice did tink. “Mi wanda wa dem a-go du neks! Az fi pul mi outa di winda, mi onggl wish dem kuda! Mi shuor se mi no waahn tan iin ya no langga!”

Shi wiet fi likl wail widout ier notn muor: laas kom a rumbling a likl cartwheels, an di soun a wan gud uol iip a vais aal a dem a taak tugeda: shi mek out di wod dem: “We di ada ladder de?—Why, mi neva haffi bring bot wan; Bill get di neks wan—Bill! fetch it ya, put it op ya! 'em tugeda fos—dem no reach half high enough yet—Oh! dem ago do well enough—Yah, Bill! (a loud crash)—“Now, who did do dat?—A did Bill, mi fancy—Who a go dung di chimney?—Nay, mi shan't! Yuh do it!— Dat mi naa go, den!—Bill a go dung—Here, Bill! di master seh yuh a go dung di chimney!”

“Oh! So Bill haffi come dung di chimney, noh?” seh Alice to harself. “Shy, dem seem fi put everyting pon Bill! Mi wouldn't be inna Bill place fi a good deal: dis fireplace narrow, fi be sure; but mi tink mi can kick a likkle!”

Shi draw har foot as far dung di chimney as she coulda, an wait til shi hear a likkle animal (shi couldn't guess a weh sort it was) a scratch an scrambling bout inna di chimney close above har: den, saying to harself “Dis a Bill,” she gi one sharp kick, an wait fi si weh woulda happen next.

Di fos ting she hear was a general chorus a “There goes Bill!” den di Rabit vais lang—“Kech im, yu bai di hed!” den silence, an den anodda confusion a voices—“Hold up him head—Brandy now—Don't choke him—How it was, old fellow? Weh happen to yuh? Tell wi all bout it!”

Last come a likkle feeble, squeaking voice, (“Dat a Bill,” tink Alice,) “Well, mi hardly know—No more, tank yuh; mi better now—but mi a deal too flustered fi tell yuh—all mi know is, someting come at mi like a Jack-in-the-box, an up mi go like a sky-rocket!”

“So yuh did, old fellow!” se di ada wan dem.

“Wi afi bon dong di ous!” di Rabbit voice seh; an Alice call out as loud as she could, “If yuh do, mi ago set Dinah at yuh!”

A did a dead silence instantly, an Alice did a tink to harself, “Mi wanda weh dem ago do next! If dem did have any sense, dem woulda tek di roof off.” Afta a minute or two, dem staat move bout again, an Alice hear di Rabbit seh, “A barrowful will do, fi staat wid.”

“A barrowful a weh? ” Alice did tink; but she neva have long fi doubt, fi di neks moment a shower a likkle pebbles come rattling inna di window, an some a dem hit har inna har face. “Mi wi put wan en tu dis,” shi se tu arself, an baal out, “Yu beta no du dat agen!” weh did produce anodda dead silence.

Alice notice wid some surprise seh di pebbles dem did a turn inna likkle cakes as dem did a lay pan di floor, an a bright idea come inna har head. “Ef mi iit wan a dem kiek ya,” shi tingk, “it shuor fi mek som chienj ina mi saiz, an az it kyaahn mek mi biga, it afi mek mi smaala, mi tingk.”

So she swallow one a di cakes, an did glad fi find out seh she staat shrink directly. Az suun az shi did likl inof fi get chuu di duor, shi ron outa di ous, an fain nof kroud a likl animal an bod a wiet outsaid. Di poor likkle Lizard, Bill, did deh inna di middle, a get hold up by two guinea-pigs, weh did a gi it someting outa a bottle. Dem all mek a rush at Alice di moment she appear; but she run weh as hard as she could, an soon find harself safe inna a thick wood.

“Di fos ting mi afi du,” Alis se tu arself, az shi waak bout iina di bush, “a fi gruo tu mi rait saiz agen, an di sekan ting a fi fain mi wie iina da nais gyaadn de. Mi tingk dat a di bes plan.”

It sound an excellent plan, no doubt, an very neatly an simply arranged; di ongl difficulty was, dat she neva have di smallest idea how fi set bout it; an while she did a peering bout anxiously among di trees, a likkle sharp bark jus ova har head mek har look up inna a great hurry.

Wan big puppy did a look dung pan har wid big round eyes, an feebly stretch out one paw, a try touch har. “Poor likkle ting!” seh Alice, inna a coaxing tone, an she try haad fi whistle to it; but she did terribly frightened all di time at di thought seh it might be hungry, in which case it woulda be very likely fi eat har up in spite a all har coaxing.

Hardly knowing weh she did do, she pick up a likkle bit a stick, an hold it out to di puppy; wen di puppy jump inna di air off all a him foot dem at once, wid a yelp a delight, an rush at di stick, an mek him believe seh him a worry; den Alice dodge behind a great thistle, fi keep harself fram get run ova; an di moment she appear pan di ada side, di puppy mek anodda rush at di stick, an tumble head ova heels inna it hurry fi get hold a it; den Alice, tinking it was very like having a game of play wid a cart-horse, an expecting every moment fi be trampled unda it feet, run round di thistle again; den di puppy staat a series a short charges pan di stick, a run a very likkle way forwards each time an a long way back, an a bark hoarsely all di while, til at last it sit dung a good way off, a panting, wid it tongue a hang outa it mout, an it great eyes half shut.

Dis did look like a good opportunity fi mek har escape; so she set off at once, an run til she did quite tired an out a breath, an til di puppy's bark sound quite faint inna di distance.

“An yet weh a dear likkle puppy it was!” seh Alice, as she lean gens a buttercup fi rest harself, an fan harself wid one a di leaves dem: “Mi shuda did like fi teach it tricks very much, if—if mi did only be di right size fi do it! Oh dear! Mi did nearly forget seh mi haffi grow up again! Mek mi see—how it is fi manage? Mi suppose or eat or drink someting; great kweschan is, weh?”

Di great kweschan certainly was, weh? Alice look all roun har at di flowers an di blades a grass, but she neva see nutten weh look like di right ting fi eat or drink unda di circumstances. A did a big mushroom did a grow near har, bout di same height as harself; an wen she did look unda it, an pan di two sides a it, an behind it, it come to har seh she coulda as well look an see weh did deh pan di top a it.

Shi stretch harself op pan tiptoe, an peep ova di edge a di mushroom, an har yai dem immediately meet dem a wan big blue caterpillar, weh did a sidong pan di tap wid it arm dem fold, quietly a smok a lang hookah, an a tek no likl nuotis a har ar a notn els.
