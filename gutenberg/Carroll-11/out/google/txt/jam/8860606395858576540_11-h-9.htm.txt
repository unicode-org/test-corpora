CHAPTER IX. Di Mock Turtle's Story

“Yu kyaahn tingk ou glad mi glad fi si yu agen, yu dier uol ting!” seh di Duchess, as she tuck har arm affectionately inna Alice's, an dem walk off tugeda.

Alice did very glad fi find har inna such a pleasant temper, an did tink to harself seh perhaps a did only di pepper weh did mek har so savage wen dem did meet inna di kitchen.

“Wen mi a Duchess,” shi seh to harself, (not inna a very hopeful tone though), “Mi naa go have no pepper inna mi kitchen at all . Soup do very well widout—Maybe it's always pepper weh mek people hot-tempered,” she goh on, very much pleased at having find out a new kind a rule, “an vine sugar—an dat mek dem camile sour bita—an—an baali-shuga an soch tingz we mek pikni swiit-swiit mi ongl wish piipl did nuo dat : den dem wudn so stingy bout it, yu nuo—”

Shi did don forget di Duchess by dis time, an shi did a likkle startled wen shi hear har voice close to har ear. “Yuh a tink bout someting, mi dear, an dat mek yuh forget fi talk. Mi cyan tell yuh jus now weh di moral a dat is, but mi ago memba it inna a bit.”

“Perhaps it nuh have one,” Alice ventured fi remark.

“Tut, tut, pikni!” seh di Duchess. “Everyting have a moral, if only yuh can find it.” An she squeeze harself up closer to Alice's side as she did a talk.

Alice neva like fi kip so close to har: fos, cause di Duchess did very ugly; an secantly, cause she did exactly di right height fi rest har chin pan Alice shoulda, an it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she neva like fi be rude, so she bear it as well as she coulda.

“Di game a gwaan rada beta now,” shi seh, bai wie a kip op di kanvasieshan likl.

“'A so,” di Duchess seh: “an di moral a dat a—'Oh, 'tis lov, 'tis lov, dat mek di worl go roun!'”

“Sombadi se,” Alice wispa, “dat it du bai evribadi a main dem uona bizniz!”

“Ah, well! It mean much di same ting,” seh di Duchess, digging har sharp likkle chin inna Alice shoulda as she added, “an di moral a dat is—'Take care a di sense, an di sounds dem ago tek care a demself.'”

“How fond she is fi find morals inna tings!” Alice did tink to harself.

“Mi dare seh yuh a wanda why mi nuh put mi arm roun yuh waist,” di Duchess seh afta a pause: “di reason is, dat mi doubtful bout di temper a yuh flamingo. Shall mi try di experiment?”

“Im might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious fi have di experiment tryed.

“Very true,” seh di Duchess: “flamingoes an mustard both bite. An di moral a dat is—'Birds of a feather flock together.'”

“Only mustard a nuh bird,” Alice remarked.

“Right, as usual,” seh di Duchess: “weh a clear way yuh have fi put tings!”

“A wan mineral, mi tink ,” Alice seh.

“Af course it is,” seh di Duchess, weh did look ready fi agree to everyting weh Alice seh; “a one big mustard-mine deh near yah. An di moral a dat is—'Di more deh deh a mine, di less deh deh a yuh.'”

“Oh, mi know!” exclaimed Alice, who neva attend to dis last remark, “it's a vegetable. It nuh look like one, but it is.”

“Mi quite agree wid yuh,” seh di Duchess; “an di moral a dat is—'Be weh yuh woulda seem fi be'—or if yuh woulda like it put it more simply—'Neva imagine yuhself fi not be otherwise dan weh it might appear to others dat weh yuh was or might be been was not otherwise dan weh yuh woulda been woulda appear to dem to be otherwise.'”

“Mi tink mi shuda andastan dat beta,” Alice seh very politely, “if mi did have it write dung: but mi cyan quite follow it as yuh seh it.”

“Dat a nuh nutten to weh mi coulda seh if mi did choose,” di Duchess ansa, inna a pleased tone.

“Pray noh trouble yuhself fi seh it no longer dan dat,” seh Alice.

“Oh, no taak bout chrobl!” seh di Duchess. “Mi mek yuh a present a everyting mi seh as yet.”

“A cheap sort a present!” Alice did tink. “Mi glad dem no gi bortdie gif laik dat!” But she neva venture fi seh it out loud.

“Yuh a tink agen?” di Duchess ask, wid anodda dig a har shaap likkle chin.

“Mi have a right fi tink,” seh Alice sharply, cause she did a staat feel a likkle worried.

“Just bout as much right,” seh di Duchess, “as pigs haffi fly; an di m—”

But yahso, to Alice's great surprise, di Duchess's voice dead weh, even inna di middle a har favorite word 'moral,' an di arm weh did link inna har own staat fi tremble. Alice look up, an deh deh di Queen did a stan up inna front a dem, wid har arms dem fold, a frown like a thunderstorm.

“A fine day, yuh Majesty!” di Duchess staat inna a low, weak voice.

“Now, mi gi yuh fair warning,” di Queen shout, stamp pan di grong as she did a taak; “either yuh or yuh head haffi be off, an dat inna bout half no time! Tek yuh choice!”

Di Duchess tek har choice, an did gaan inna a moment.

“Mek wi gwaan wid di game,” di Queen seh to Alice; an Alice did too much fraid fi seh a word, but slowly follow har back to di croquet-ground.

Di ada guest dem did tek advantage a di Queen's absence, an did a rest inna di shade: however, di moment dem si har, dem hurry back to di game, di Queen merely remarking seh a moment's delay woulda cost dem life.

Aal di taim dem did a plie di Kwiin neva lef aaf a kwaaril wid di ada plieya dem, an a baal out “Off wid im ed!” or “Off wid har head!” Dem deh whom she sentence did tek into custody by di soldiers, who of course did haffi lef off being arches fi do dis, so dat by di end a half an hour or so deh neva have no arches lef, an all di players, except di King, di Queen, an Alice, did inna custody an unda sentence a execution.

Den di Queen lef off, quite outa breath, an seh to Alice, “Yuh si di Mock Turtle yet?”

“No,” seh Alice. “Mi nuh even know weh a Mock Turtle is.”

“A di ting Mock Turtle Soup mek outa,” di Kwiin se.

“Mi neva si one, or hear bout one,” seh Alice.

“Come on, den,” seh di Queen, “an him ago tell yuh him history.”

As dem did a walk off tugeda, Alice hear di King seh inna a low voice, to di company generally, “You all pardoned.” “Kom, dat a wan gud ting!” she seh to harself, cause she did feel quite unhappy at di numba a executions di Queen did order.

Dem very soon come on a Gryphon, weh did a lay fast asleep inna di sun. (If yuh nuh know weh a Gryphon is, look pan di picture.) “Op, lazy ting!” di Queen seh, “an tek dis young lady fi si di Mock Turtle, an fi hear him history. Mi haffi go back an si afta some executions weh mi order;” an shi walk weh, lef Alice alone wid di Gryphon. Alice neva quite like di look a di creature, but pan di whole she did tink it woulda be quite as safe fi stay wid it as fi go afta dat deh savage Queen: so she wait.

Di Gryphon sidong op an rub it yai dem: den it wach di Kwiin til shi did outa sait: den it chuckle. “Weh fun!” di Gryphon seh, half to himself, half to Alice.

“ Weh di fun?” seh Alice.

“Why, she ,” seh di Gryphon. “A all har fancy, dat: dem neva execute nobody, yuh know. Come on!”

“Everybody seh 'come on!' yah,” Alice did tink, as she did a go slow afta it: “Mi neva did so order bout inna all mi life, neva!”

Dem neva go far before dem si di Mock Turtle inna di distance, a sidong sad an lonely pan a likkle ledge a rock, an, as dem did a come nearer, Alice coulda hear him a sigh as if him heart woulda break. Shi did sari fi im bad bad. “Weh him sorry?” she ask di Gryphon, an di Gryphon ansa, very nearly inna di same words as before, “A all him fancy, dat: him nuh have no sorrow, yuh know. Come on!”

So dem go op tu di Mok Tortl, uu luk pan dem wid big yai ful a tier, bot no se notn.

“Dis yah young lady,” seh di Gryphon, “she waan fi know yuh history, she do.”

“Mi ago tell it har,” di Mock Turtle seh inna a deep, hollow tone: “sit dung, both a unu, an nuh speak a word til mi don.”

So dem sidong, an nobadi neva taak fi kopl minit. Alice tink to harself, “Mi nuh see how him can eva finish, if him nuh staat.” But she wait patiently.

“Once,” di Mock Turtle seh at last, wid a deep sigh, “Mi was a real Turtle.”

Dem words deh did a follow by a very long silence, weh did break only by a occasional exclamation a “Hjckrrh!” fram di Gryphon, an di constant heavy sobbing a di Mock Turtle. Alice did very nearly get up an seh, “Tank yuh, sir, fi yuh interesting story,” but she couldn't help tink seh more was fi come, so she did a sit still an neva seh nutten.

“Wen wi did likkle,” di Mock Turtle goh on at last, more calmly, though still a sobbing a likkle now an den, “wi did go a school inna di sea. Di master was an ole Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”

“Why yuh call him Tortoise, if him neva one?” Alice ask.

“Wi call him Tortoise cause him did teach wi,” di Mock Turtle seh angryly: “really yuh very dull!”

“Yuh shuda be shame a yuhself fi ask such a simple kweschan,” added di Gryphon; an den dem both sidong silent an look pon poor Alice, weh did feel ready fi sink inna di earth. At last di Gryphon seh to di Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Noh be all day bout it!” an him continue inna dem words yah:

“Yes, wi did go a skuul inna di sii, duo yu mait no biliiv it—”

“Mi neva seh mi neva!” Alice interrupt.

“Yuh did,” di Mock Turtle seh.

“Hold yuh tongue!” added di Gryphon, before Alice coulda speak again. Di Mock Turtle go on.

“Wi did have di bes a educations—in fact, wi did go a school every day—”

“ Mi go a day-school, too,” seh Alice; “yuh no need fi be so proud as all dat.”

“Wid extras?” di Mock Turtle ask likkle anxiously.

“Yes,” seh Alice, “we laan French an music.”

“An washing?” di Mock Turtle seh.

“Certainly not!” seh Alice indignantly.

“Ah! den yuh school neva really good,” di Mock Turtle seh inna a tone a great relief. “Now at ours dem did have at di end a di bill, 'French, music, an washing —extra.'”

“Yuh couldn't have waan it much,” seh Alice; “living at di bottom a di sea.”

“Mi couldn't afford fi learn it.” di Mock Turtle seh wid a sigh. “Mi only tek di regular course.”

“Weh dat was?” Alice aks.

“Reeling an Writhing, a course, fi staat wid,” di Mock Turtle ansa; “an den di different branch dem a Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, an Derision.”

“Mi neva hear bout 'Uglification,'” Alice ventured fi seh. “Weh it is?”

Di Gryphon lift up both a him paws inna surprise. “Weh! Neva hear bout uglifying!” it exclaimed. “Yuh know weh fi beautify is, mi suppose?”

“Yes,” seh Alice doubtfully: “it mean—fi—mek—anyting—prettier.”

“Well, den,” di Gryphon seh, “if yuh nuh know weh fi uglify is, yuh a simpleton.”

Alice neva feel encouraged fi ask no more questions bout it, so she turn to di Mock Turtle, an seh “Weh else yuh did have fi learn?”

“Well, deh did have Mystery,” di Mock Turtle replied, counting off di subjects pan him flappers, “—Mystery, ancient an modern, wid Seaography: den Drawling—di Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, weh used to come once a week: him teach wi Drawling, Stretching, an Fainting in Coils.”

“Weh dat did like?” seh Alice.

“Wel, mi kyaahn shuo yu miself,” di Mok Tortl se. “Mi tuu stiif. An di Griifan neva laan it.”

“Hadn't time,” seh di Gryphon: “Mi goh to di Classics master, though. Him was an ole crab, him was.”

“Mi neva go to him,” di Mock Turtle seh wid a sigh: “im did teach Laughing an Grief, dem use to seh.”

“So him did, so him did,” di Gryphon seh, a sigh inna him turn; an di two creatures dem did a hide dem face inna dem paws.

“An how many hours a day yuh did a do lessons?” seh Alice, inna a hurry fi change di subject.

“Ten hours di first day,” seh di Mock Turtle: “nine di next, an so on.”

“Weh a curious plan!” Alice baal out.

“A dat mek dem call dem lessons,” di Gryphon remarked: “cause dem lessen fram day to day.”

Dis was a quite new idea to Alice, an she did tink it ova likkle before she mek har next remark. “Den di eleventh day mosi did a holiday?”

“Af course it was,” di Mock Turtle seh.

“An how yuh manage pan di twelfth?” Alice goh on eagerly.

“Dat's enough bout lessons,” di Gryphon interrupt inna a very decided tone: “tel har someting bout di games now.”
