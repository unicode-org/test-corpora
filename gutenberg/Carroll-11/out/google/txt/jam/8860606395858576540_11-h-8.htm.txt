CHAPTER VIII. Di Queen's Croquet-Ground

A big rose-tree did deh near di entrance a di garden: di rose dem weh did a grow pan it did white, but a did three gardeners at it, busy a paint dem red. Alice did tink dis a one very curious ting, an she go nearer fi watch dem, an jus as she did a come up to dem she hear one a dem seh, “Look out now, Five! No go splash paint ova mi like dat!”

“Mi couldn't help it,” seh Five, inna a sulky tone; “Seven jogged mi elbow.”

Pan we Sebm luk op an se, “A so it go, Five! Aalwiez put di blem pan ada piipl!”

“ Yuh beta nuh talk!” Five seh. “Mi ier di Kwiin se ongl yeside yu dizorv fi get kot aaf yu ed!”

“Weh fi?” seh di one weh did a taak fos.

“Dat a nuh yuh business, Two!” Seven seh.

“Yes, a fi him business!” seh Five, “an mi ago tell him—a did fi bring di cook tulip-roots instead a onions.”

Seven fling dung him brush, an did jus staat “Well, a all di unjust tings—” wen him eye chance fi fall pan Alice, as she did a stan up a watch dem, an him check himself suddenly: di ada ones did look roun too, an all a dem bow low.

“Yuh woulda tell mi,” seh Alice, a likkle timidly, “why yuh a paint dem deh roses deh?”

Five an Seven neva seh nutten, but look pon Two. Two staat inna a low voice, “Why di fact is, yuh see, Miss, dis yah shuda did a red rose-tree, an we put a white one inna by mistake; an if di Queen did fi find it out, wi shuda all have wi head cut off, yuh know. So yuh see, Miss, wi a do wi bes, before she comes”— Five, five did a look fi anxious. kraas di gyaadn, kaal out “Di Kwiin! Di Kwiin!” an di three gardeners dem fling demself flat pan dem face dem instantly. Dem did a sound a plenty footsteps, an Alice look roun, eager fi si di Queen.

Fos ten soldiers did a carry clubs; dem deh did all shape like di three gardeners, oblong an flat, wid dem han an feet dem at di corner: next di ten courtiers; dem did ornament all ova wid diamonds, an dem did a walk two an two, as di soldiers dem did do. Afta dem deh come di royal pickney dem; deh did have ten a dem, an di likkle dears dem come a jump merrily along han inna han, inna couples: dem did all ornamented wid hearts. Next come di guests, mostly Kings an Queens, an mongst dem Alice recognize di White Rabbit: it did a talk inna a hurried nervous manner, smile at everyting weh dem did a seh, an go by widout noticing har. Den di Knave a Hearts did a carry di King's crown pan a crimson velvet cushion; an, last a all dis grand procession, come DI KING AN QUEEN A HEARTS.

Alice did rada doubtful weda she shudn't lie dung pan har face like di three gardeners, but she couldn't memba eva hear bout such a rule at processsions; “an besides, weh woulda be di use a procession,” did tink she, “ef people did have all fi lie dung pan dem face, so dat dem couldn't see it?” So shi tan op stil we shi did de, an wiet.

Wen di procession come opposite to Alice, dem all stop an look pon har, an di Queen seh severely “Who is dis?” Shi seh it to di Knave of Hearts, who only bow an smile in reply.

"Eediat!" seh di Queen, tossing har head impatiently; an, turning to Alice, she go on, “Weh yuh name, pickney?”

“Mi name Alice, so please yuh Majesty,” seh Alice very politely; but she added, to harself, “Why, dem a only a pack a cards, afta all. Mi nuh need fi fraid a dem!”

“An uu dem ya? ” di Kwiin se, a paint tu di chrii gyaadna dem we did a lidong roun di ruuz-chrii; fi, yuh si, az dem did a lidong pan dem fies, an di pattern pan dem bak did a di siem laik di res a di pack, shi kudn tel weda dem a did gyaadna, ar suoja, ar kuotier, ar chrii a ar uona pikni dem.

“How mi fi know?” seh Alice, surprised at har own courage. “A nuh business a mi .”

Di Queen ton crimson wid fury, an, afta shi glare at har fi a moment like a wild beast, shi scream “Off wid har head! Off—”

“Nonsense!” seh Alice, very loud an decidedly, an di Queen did silent.

Di King put him han pan har arm, an timidly seh “Consider, mi dear: she a only a pikni!”

Di Queen turn weh fram him wid bex, an seh to di Knave “Turn dem ova!”

Di Knave did do so, very carefully, wid one foot.

"Tan up!" di Queen seh, inna a shrill, loud voice, an di three gardeners dem jump up instantly, an staat bow to di King, di Queen, di royal pickney dem, an everybody else.

“Lef aaf dat!” di Queen baal out. “Yuh mek mi giddy.” An den, ton tu di rose-tree, shi seh, “Weh yuh a duh yah?”

“Mek it please yuh Majesty,” seh Two, inna a very humble tone, going dung pan one knee as him did a talk, “we did a try—”

" Mi si!" seh di Queen, weh did a examine di roses dem. “Off wid dem head!” an di procession move on, three a di soldiers dem did lef behind fi execute di unfortunate gardeners, weh did run to Alice fi protection.

“Yuh shan't get behead!” seh Alice, an shi put dem inna a big flowa-pot weh did deh near. Di three soldiers dem wander bout fi a minute or two, a look fi dem, an den quietly march off afta di ada ones dem.

“Dem head off?” di Queen shout.

“Dem head dem gaan, if it please yuh Majesty!” di soldiers dem shout in reply.

“A so it go!” di Queen shout. “Yuh can play croquet?”

Di soldiers dem did silent, an look pon Alice, as di question did evidently mean fi har.

"Yea!" Alice baal out.

“Come on, den!” roar di Queen, an Alice jain di procession, a wanda very much weh woulda happen next.

“A—a wan very fine day!” seh a timid voice at har side. Shi did a walk by di White Rabbit, weh did a peep anxiously inna har face.

“Very,” seh Alice: “—weh di Duchess deh?”

“Hush! Hush!” di Rabbit seh inna a low, hurried tone. Im look anxiously ova im shoulda as im did a taak, an den im raise imself pan tiptoe, put im mout close to har ear, an whisper “She deh unda sentence a execution.”

“Weh fi?” seh Alice.

“Yuh seh 'What a pity!'?” di Rabbit ask.

“No, mi neva,” Alice seh. “Mi nuh tink it's at all a pity. Mi seh 'Weh fi?'”

“Shi baks di Kwiin iez dem—” di Rabit staat. Alice gi a likkle scream a laughter. “Oh, hush!” di Rabbit whisper inna a frightened tone. “Di Kwiin wi ier yu, yu si, shi kom likl liet, an di Kwiin se—”

“Get to yuh places!” di Queen shout inna a thunder voice, an people staat run roun inna all directions, a tumbling up against each other; however, dem get settle dung inna a minute or two, an di game staat. Alice did tink she neva si such a curious croquet-ground inna har life; it was all ridges an furrows; di balls dem was live hedgehogs, di mallets dem did live flamingoes, an di soldiers dem did haffi double demself up an fi stan op pan dem han an fut dem, fi mek di arches dem.

Di chief difficulty weh Alice did find at first was inna managing har flamingo: she succeeded fi get it body tuck weh, comfortably enough, unda har arm, wid it legs hanging dung, but generally, jus as she did get it neck nicely straighten out, an did a go gi di hedgehog a blow wid it head, it woulda twist itself an look up inna har face, wid such a puzzle expression dat she couldn't help bursting out laughing: an wen she did get it head dung, an did a go staat again, it did very provoking fi find out seh di hedgehog did unroll itself, an did inna di act a crawl weh: besides all dis, deh did have a ridge or furrow inna di way weh she did waan send di hedgehog to, an, as di double soldiers dem did always get up an off fi walk up ada parts a di ground, Alice soon come to di conclusion seh a did a very difficult game indeed.

Di players dem all play at once widout wait fi turn, quarreling all di while, an fight fi di hedgehogs; an inna a very short time di Queen did inna a furious passion, an go stamp bout, an shout “Off wid him head!” or “Off wid har head!” bout once inna a minute.

Alice staat feel very uneasy: fi be sure, she neva as yet have no dispute wid di Queen, but she did know seh it might happen any minute, “an den,” shi did tink, “weh woulda happen a mi? Dem dreadfully fond a beheading people yah; di great wonder is, dat deh deh any one left alive!”

Shi did a look bout fi some way fi get weh, an a wanda if shi kuda get weh widout piipl si ar, wen shi notice a curious appearance inna di air: it puzzle har very much at first, but, afta she watch it a minute or two, she mek it out fi be a grin, an she seh to harself “A di Cheshire Cat: now mi shall have somebody fi talk to.”

“How yuh a get on?” seh di Cat, as soon as it have mout enough fi it talk wid.

Alice wait til di eyes dem appear, an den nod. “It nuh use fi talk to it,” she did tink, “til it ears come, or at least one a dem.” Inna anodda minute di whole head appear, an den Alice put dung har flamingo, an staat an account a di game, feeling very glad she did have somebody fi listen to har. Di Pus did look like it did tink seh a did enough a it now inna di sight, an no more a it did a appear.

“Mi no tink dem play at all fairly,” Alice staat, inna rather a complaining tone, “an dem all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak—an dem nuh look like dem have no rules in particular; at least, if dem have, nobody attend to dem—an yuh no know how confusing it is all di tings dem weh deh deh deh inna di arch's alive; go chruu next walking bout at di ada end a di ground—an mi shuda did croquet di Queen's hedgehog jus now, only it run weh wen it si mine a come!”

“How yuh like di Queen?” di Pus seh inna a low voice.

“Not at all,” seh Alice: “shi so extremely—” Jus den shi notice seh di Queen did deh close behind har, a lisn: so shi goh aan, “—likely fi win, dat it hardly worth wile shi a finish di game.”

Di Kwiin smail an paas aan.

“A who yuh a talk to?” se di King, a go op tu Alice, an a luk pan di Pus ed wid nof kyariositi.

“A one a mi fren dem—a Cheshire Cat,” seh Alice: “allow mi fi introduce it.”

“Mi no like di look a it at all,” di King seh: “however, it may kiss mi han if it like.”

“Mi woulda radda nuh,” di Cat seh.

“No bada be impertinent,” di King seh, “an no look pon mi so!” Him get behind Alice as him did a talk.

“A cat may look pon a king,” seh Alice. “Mi read dat inna some book, but mi nuh memba weh.”

“Well, it haffi get tek weh,” di King seh very decidedly, an him call di Queen, weh did a pass at di moment, “Mi dear! Mi wish yuh woulda have dis cat tek weh!”

Di Queen did have only one way fi settle all difficulties, great or small. “Off wid him head!” shi seh, widout even look roun.

“Mi ago fetch di executioner miself,” di King seh eagerly, an him hurry weh.

Alice did tink she might as well go back, an see how di game did a gwaan, as she hear di Queen's voice inna di distance, a scream wid passion. Shi did already hear har sentence three a di players dem fi get execute fi have miss dem turn, an she neva like di look a tings at all, as di game did inna such confusion dat she neva know weda a did har turn or not. So shi goh fi look fi har hedgehog.

Di hedgehog did a fight wid anodda hedgehog, weh did look like Alice a one excellent opportunity fi croquet one a dem wid di ada one: di only difficulty was, dat har flamingo did gaan across to di ada side a di garden, weh Alice coulda see it a try inna a helpless sort a way fi fly up inna a tree.

By di time she did kech di flamingo an bring it back, di fight did don, an di two hedgehog dem did out a sight: “but it nuh matta much,” Alice did tink, “as all di arches dem did gaan fram dis side a di ground.” So shi tek it weh anda har arm, so it kudn escape agen, an go bak fi a likl muor kanvasieshan wid har fren.

Wen shi get bak a di Cheshire Cat, shi did sopraiz fi fain out se a nof big kroud did a gyada op roun it: a did wan dispute a gwaan bitwiin di executioner, di King, an di Queen, uu did a taak at once, wail aal a di res did quite silent, an did luk very uncomfortable.

Di moment Alice appear, she get appeal to by all three fi settle di question, an dem repeat dem arguments to har, though, as dem all did a talk at once, she find it very hard indeed fi mek out exactly weh dem seh.

Di executioner's argument was, dat yuh couldn't cut off a head unless yuh have a body fi cut it off fram: dat him neva haffi do such a ting before, an him neva did a go staat at him time a life.

Di King argument was, dat anyting weh have a head coulda be headed, an dat yuh nuh fi talk nonsense.

Di Queen's argument was, dat if someting neva done bout it inna less dan no time she woulda have everybody executed, all round. (A did dis laas remark weh did mek di whole party look so grave an anxious.)

Alice couldn't tink a nutten else fi seh but “It belong to di Duchess: yuh better ask har bout it.”

“Shi iina prizn,” di Kwiin se tu di egzekiushana: “Kyari ar ya.” An di executioner go weh like a arrow.

Di Cat head staat fide weh di moment him did gaan, an, by di time him did come back wid di Duchess, it did entirely disappear; so di King an di executioner run wildly up an dung a look fi it, while di rest a di party go back to di game.
