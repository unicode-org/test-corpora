CHAPTER I. Down di Rabbit-Hole

Alice did a staat get very tired a sidong wid har sista pan di bank, an a no av notn fi du: wan ar tuu taim shi did a luk inna di buk weh har sista did a riid, bot it neva av no pikcha ar kanvasieshan iina it, “an wa a di yuus a wan buk,” Alice did tingk “widout pikcha ar kanvasieshan?”

So shi did a consider inna har own mind (as well as she coulda, fi di hot day mek har feel very sleepy an stupid), weda di pleasure a mek a daisy-chain woulda be worth di trouble a get up an pick di daisies, wen suddenly a White Rabbit wid pink eyes run close by har.

Notn neva deh so very remarkable inna dat; nor did Alice tink it so very much out a di way fi hear di Rabbit seh to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! Mi shall be late!” (wen shi did tink bout it aftawards, it come to har seh shi shuda did a wanda bout dis, but at di time it all did look quite natural); but wen di Rabbit actually tek a watch outa it waistcoat-pocket , an look pon it, an den hurried on, Alice staat up har foot dem, cause it flash across har mind seh she neva before see a rabbit wid either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch fi tek outa it, an a burn wid curiosity, she did a run across di field, fi in time fi see it pop dung a big rabbit-hole unda di hedge.

Inna anodda moment dung go Alice afta it, neva once considering how inna di worl she did fi get out again.

Di rabbit-hole go straight on like a tunnel fi some way, an den dip suddenly dung, so suddenly dat Alice neva have a moment fi tink bout stop harself before she find harself a fall dung a very deep well.

Either di well did very deep, or she did fall very slow, cause she did have plenty a time as she did a go dung fi look bout har an fi wanda weh did a go happen next. Fos, shi chrai fi luk dong an mek out we shi did a kom tu, bot it did tuu daak fi si notn; den she look pon di sides a di well, an notice seh dem did full a cupboards an book-shelves; yah an deh she si maps an picture dem weh did a hang pan pegs. Shi tek dong a jar fram one a di shelf dem as shi did a pass; it did have di label “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to har great disappointment it did empty: she neva like fi drop di jar fi fear fi kill somebody unda it, so she manage fi put it inna one a di cupboards as she did a fall past it.

"Well!" Alice did tink to harself, “afta such a fall as dis, mi naa go tink notn bout tumbling dung stairs! How brave dem all a go tink mi at home! Why, mi wouldn't seh nutten bout it, even if mi did fall off di top a di house!” (Weh was very likely true.)

Down, dung, dung. Di fall woulda neva come to an end? “Mi wanda how many miles mi fall by dis time?” she seh loud. “Mi mosi a get somwe nier di migl a di ort. Mek mi si: dat wuda bi fuo touzn mail dong, mi tingk—” (kaaz, yu si, Alice did laan nof tingz a dis ya sortn inna ar lesn dem ina di skuulruum, an duo dis neva did a gud chaans fi shuo aaf ar nalij, az nobadi neva de de fi lisn tu ar, it did stil gud fi praktis bout se, “—yes) di right distance—but den mi wanda weh Latitude or Longitude mi have to?” (Alice neva have no idea weh Latitude was, or Longitude either, but shi did tink dem was nice grand words fi seh.)

Presently she staat again. “Mi wanda if mi ago fall right chruu di earth! How funny it ago look fi come out mongst di people dem weh walk wid dem head dung! Di Antipathies, mi tink—” (she did rather glad seh nobadi neva did a lisn, dis time, as it neva sound at all di right word) “—but mi ago haffi ask dem weh di name a di country is, yuh know, New Maam, Pase. Zealand or Australia?” (an she try fi curtsey as she did a taak—fancy curtseying as yuh a fall thru di air! Yuh tink yuh coulda manage it?) “An weh an ignorant likkle girl she ago tink mi fi ask! No, it naa go eva do fi ask: perhaps mi ago see it write up somweh.”

Down, dung, dung. Notn els neva deh fi do, so Alice suun staat taak agen. “Dinah ago miss mi very much to-night, mi shuda tink!” (Dinah was di cat.) “Mi hope dem wi memba har saucer a milk at tea-time. Dinah mi dear! Mi wish yuh did deh dung yah wid mi! No mice nuh deh inna di air, mi fraid, but yuh might ketch a bat, an dat very like a mouse, yuh know. But do cats eat bats, mi wonder?” An yaso Alice staat fi get rada sliip, an shi go aan se tu arself, ina wahn dreamy sortn wie, “Puot iit bat? Pus iit bat?” an sometimes, “Bats eat cats?” fi, yuh si, az shi kudn ansa no kweschan, it neva mata wich wie shi put it. Shi did feel seh shi did a doze off, an did jus staat dream seh shi did a walk hand inna han wid Dinah, an a seh to har very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell mi di truth: yuh eva eat a bat?” wen suddenly, thump! thump! dong shi come pan a heap a sticks an dry leaves, an di fall did ova.

Alice neva get no bit hurt, an she jump up pan har foot dem inna a moment: she look up, but it did all dark ovahead; before har was anodda long passage, an di White Rabbit did still deh inna di sight, a hurry dung it. No moment neva deh fi be lost: away go Alice like di wind, an was jus in time fi hear it seh, as it turn a corner, “Oh mi ears an whiskers, how late it's getting!” Shi did deh close behind it wen she turn di corner, but di Rabbit neva deh deh no more: she find harself inna a long, low hall, weh did lait up by a row a lamps weh did a hang fram di roof.

Dem did have doors all roun di hall, but dem did lock; an wen Alice did deh all di way dung one side an up di ada, a try every door, she walk sadly dung di middle, a wanda how she did eva get out again.

Suddenly she come upon a likkle three-legged table, all mek outa solid glass; notn neva deh pan it except a likkle golden key, an Alice's first thought was dat it might belong to one a di doors a di hall; but, alas! either di locks dem did too big, or di key did too small, but at any rate it wouldn't open non a dem. However, pan di secan time round, she come upon a low curtain weh she neva notice before, an behind it was a likkle door bout fifteen inches high: she try di likkle golden key inna di lock, an to har great delight it fit!

Alice open di door an find out seh it did a lead inna a likkle passage, not much larger dan a rat-hole: she kneel dung an look along di passage inna di loveliest garden yuh eva si. How she did a long fi get outa dat deh dark hall, an wander bout mongst dem beds a bright flowers an dem cool fountains, but she couldn't even get har head thru di doorway; “an even if mi head woulda go through,” tink poor Alice, “it woulda be a very likkle use widout mi shoulders. Oh, how mi wish mi coulda shut up like a telescope! Mi tink mi coulda, if mi only know how fi staat.” For, yuh see, so much out-of-the-way tings did happen lately, dat Alice did staat tink seh very few tings indeed did really impossible.

It did luk laik se it neva mek no yuus fi wiet bai di likl duor, so shi go bak a di tiebl, haaf a uop se shi kuda fain wan neda kii pan it, ar at eni riet a buk a ruul fi shet op piipl laik teliskop: dis taim shi fain wan likl botel pan it, (“we siem wie neva de ya bifuo,” se Alice,) an roun di nek a di botel did av wan label wid di wod dem “IN KDR,” beautifully printed pan it inna big letters.

It was all very well fi seh “Drink mi,” but di wise likkle Alice neva did a go do dat inna a hurry. “No, mi ago look fos,” she seh, “an si if it mark ' poison ' or not”; fi she did read several nice likkle histories bout children weh did get burn, an eat up by wild beast an other unpleasant tings, all because dem would n't memba di simple rules dem fren dem did teach dem: such as, dat a red-hot poker woulda burn yuh if yuh hold it too long; an dat if yuh cut yuh finga very deep wid a knife, it usually bleed; an she neva forget seh, if yuh drink much fram a bottle weh mark “poison,” it almost certain fi disagree wid yuh, sooner or later.

However, dis bottle neva did mark “poison,” so Alice did a venture fi taste it, an fi find it very nice, (it did have, in fact, a sort a mixed flavor a cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, an hot buttered toast,) she very soon finish it off.

“Weh a curious feeling!” seh Alice; “Mi mus a shut up like a telescope.”

An so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, an har face brighten up at di thought seh she was now di right size fi go thru di likkle door inna dat deh lovely garden. Fos, however, she wait fi a few minutes fi see if she did a go shrink any furda: she did feel a likkle nervous bout dis; “kaaz it maita don, yu nuo,” Alice se tu arself, “ina mi go out aaltogeda, laik a kyandl. Mi wanda ou mi shuda bi den?” An shi chrai fi fansi ou di faiya a wahn kyandl tan afta di kyandl bluo out, kaa shi kudn memba eva si soch a ting.

Afta a wail, wen shi fain out se notn neva apm muor, shi disaid fi go inna di gyaadn wans; but, alas fi poor Alice! wen shi reach di door, shi fain se shi did figet di likl guol kii, an wen shi go bak a di tiebl fi it, shi fain out se shi kudn riich it: shi kuda si it gud gud chuu di glaas, an shi chrai ar bes fi klaim op wan a di fut dem a di tiebl, bot it did tuu sliip; an wen shi did taiyad out a chrai, di puor likl ting sidong an baal.

“Kom, no yuus fi baal so!” seh Alice to harself, rather sharply; “Mi advise yuh fi lef off dis minute!” Shi generally gi harself very good advice, (though she very seldom follow it), an sometimes she scold harself so severely as to bring tears inna har eyes; an once she memba try fi box har own ears fi have cheat harself inna a game a croquet she did a play against harself, fi dis curious pickney did very fond a pretend fi be two people. “Bot it naa no yuus nou,” puor Alis tingk, “fi gwaan laik se yu a tuu smadi!

Soon har eye fall pan a likkle glass box weh did a lay unda di table: she open it, an find inna it a very likkle cake, pan which di words “EAT MI” did beautifully marked inna currants. “Wel, mi wi iit it,” Alis se, “an ef it mek mi gruo biga, mi kyan reach di kii; an ef it mek mi gruo smaala, mi kyan kriip anda di duor; so eniwie mi wi get inna di gyaadn, an mi no kier wich wan apm!”

Shi nyam likl bit, an se anxiousli tu arself, “Wich wie? Wich wie?”, a uol ar an pan di tap a ar ed fi fiil wich wie it did a gruo, an shi did wel sopraiz fi fain out se shi did tan di siem saiz: fi bi shuor, dis jinarali apn wen smadi iit kiek, bot Alice did get so moch ina di wie fi ekspek notn out-of-the-way, it luk laik it did apn quite dull an stupid fi life go on inna di common way.

So shi set fi work, an very soon shi finish off di cake.
