<h2>Mi</h2>
<p>Inna mi younger an more vulnerable years mi fadda gi mi some advice weh mi a turn ova inna mi mind ever since.</p>
<p>“Enitaim yuh feel like yuh a criticize anybody,” him tell mi, “jus memba seh all di people dem inna dis ya worl neva have di advantages dem weh yuh did have.”</p>
<p>Him neva seh notn more, but wi always been unusually communicative inna a reserved way, an mi andastan seh him mean a great deal more dan dat. In consequence, mi inclined fi reserve all judgements, a habit weh open up plenty curious natures to mi an also mek mi di victim a not a few veteran bores. Di abnormal mind quick fi detect an attach itself to dis quality wen it appear inna a normal person, an so it come bout dat inna college mi did unjustly accuse a being a politician, cause mi did privy to di secret griefs a wild, unknown man. Most a di confidence dem neva did a look fi—frequently mi did a feign sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity wen mi realize by some unmistakable sign seh an intimate revelation did a quiver pan di horizon; fi di intimate revelations a young man, or at least di terms in which dem express dem, are usually plagiaristic an marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. Mi still a likkle fraid fi miss someting if mi forget seh, as mi fadda snobbishly suggest, an mi snobbishly repeat, a sense a di fundamental decencies dem parcel out unequally at birth.</p>
<p>An, afta mi boast dis way a mi tolerance, mi come to di admission seh it have a limit. Conduct maita be found pan di hard rock or di wet marshes, but afta a certain point mi nuh care weh it found pan. Wen mi come back fram di East last autumn mi did feel seh mi did waan di worl fi deh inna uniform an at a sort a moral attention fi eva; Mi neva waan no more riotous excursions wid privileged glimpses inna di human heart. Only Gatsby, di man weh gi him name to dis book, did exempt fram mi reaction—Gatsby, weh did represent everyting weh mi have an unaffected scorn fi. If personality a one unbroken series a successful gestures, den deh did have someting gorgeous bout him, some heightened sensitivity to di promises a life, as if him did relate to one a dem intricate machines deh weh register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. Dis responsiveness neva have nutten fi duh wid dat deh flabby impressionability weh dignified unda di name a di “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift fi hope, a romantic readiness such as mi neva find inna no ada person an weh it is not likely mi shall eva find again. No—Gatsby turn out all right at di end; a weh preyed pan Gatsby, weh foul dust float inna di wake a him dreams weh temporarily close out mi interest inna di abortive sorrows an short-winded elations a man.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Mi family a prominent, well-to-do people inna dis Middle Western city fi three generations. Di Carraways dem a someting a clan, an wi have a tradition seh wi a descended fram di Dukes of Buccleuch, but di actual founder a mi line was mi granfadda bredda, weh did come yah inna fifty-one, sen a substitute to di Civil War, an staat di wholesale hardware business weh mi fadda carry on today.</p>
<p>Mi neva si dis great-uncle, but mi suppose to look like him—wid special reference to di rather hard-boiled painting weh hang inna mi fadda office. Mi graduate fram New Haven inna 1915, jus a quarter a century afta mi fadda, an a likkle later mi tek paat inna dat deh delayed Teutonic migration weh dem call di Great War. Mi did enjoy di counter-raid so thoroughly dat mi come back restless. Insted a be di warm center a di worl, di Middle West now did look like di ragged edge a di universe—so mi decide fi go East an laan di bond business. Everybody mi know did inna di bond business, so mi did tink it coulda support one more single man. All mi aunts an uncles dem did a talk it ova as if dem did a choose a prep school fi mi, an finally seh, “Why—ye-es,” wid very grave, hesitant faces. Faada agree fi finance mi fi a year, an afta various delays mi come East, permanently, mi did tink, inna di spring a twenty-two.</p>
<p>Di practical ting was fi find rooms inna di city, but it was a warm season, an mi did jus lef a country wid wide lawns an friendly trees, so wen a young man at di office suggest seh wi tek a house together inna a commuting town, it sound like a great idea. Im find di house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at di last minute di firm order him to Washington, an mi go out to di country alone. Mi did have a dog—at least mi did have him fi a few days until him run weh—an a ole Dodge an a Finnish woman, weh mek mi bed an cook breakfast an mutter Finnish wisdom to harself ova di electric stove.</p>
<p>It did lonely fi a day or so until one morning some man, weh did come more recently dan mi, stop mi pan di road.</p>
<p>“How yuh get to West Egg village?” him ask helplessly.</p>
<p>Mi tell him. An as mi did a walk on mi did lonely no more. Mi was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. Im did casually confer pan mi di freedom a di neighbourhood.</p>
<p>An so wid di sunshine an di great bursts a leaves weh did a grow pan di trees, jus like how tings grow inna fast movies, mi did have dat deh familiar conviction seh life did a staat ova again wid di summer.</p>
<p>So much did deh fi read, fi one ting, an so much fine health fi pull dung outa di young breath-giving air. Mi buy a dozen volumes pan banking an credit an investment securities, an dem did a stan up pan mi shelf inna red an gold like new money fram di mint, a promise fi unfold di shining secrets dem weh only Midas an Morgan an Maecenas did know. An mi did have di high intention fi read plenty ada books besides. Mi did rada literary inna college—one year mi write a series a very solemn an obvious editorials fi di Yale News—an now mi did a go bring back all dem ting deh inna mi life an become again dat most limited a all specialists, di “well-rounded man.” Dis a nuh jus an epigram—life is much more successfully looking at from a single window, afta all.</p>
<p>A did a matter a chance dat mi shuda did rent a house inna one a di strangest communities inna North America. A did pan dat deh slender riotous island weh extend itself due east a New York—an weh deh deh, mongx ada natural curiosities, two unusual formations a lan. Twenty miles fram di city a pair a enormous eggs, identical inna contour an separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out inna di most domesticated body a salt water inna di Western hemisphere, di great wet barnyard a Long Island Sound. Dem a nuh perfect ovals—like di egg inna di Columbus story, dem both crushed flat at di contact end—but dem physical resemblance mus be a source a perpetual wonder to di gulls dem weh fly ovahead. To di wingless a more interesting phenomenon is dem disimilarity in every particular except shape an size.</p>
<p>Mi did live a West Egg, di—well, di less fashionable a di two, though dis a one most superficial tag fi express di bizarre an not a likkle sinister contrast between dem. Mi house did deh a di very tip a di egg, only fifty yards fram di Sound, an squeeze between two huge places weh rent fi twelve or fifteen thousand a season. Di one pan mi right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation a some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, wid a tower pan one side, spanking new unda a thin beard a raw ivy, an a marble swimming pool, an more dan forty acres a lawn an garden. A did Gatsby's mansion. Or, rather, as mi neva know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of dat deh name. Mi own house was an eyesore, but it was a likkle eyesore, an it did get overlook, so mi did have a view a di wata, a partial view a mi neighbour's lawn, an di consoling proximity a millionaires—all fi eighty dollars a month.</p>
<p>Across di courtesy bay di white palaces a fashionable East Egg glitter along di wata, an di history a di summer really staat pan di evening mi drive ova deh fi have dinner wid di Tom Buchanans. Daisy was mi secan cousin once removed, an mi did know Tom inna college. An jus afta di war mi spen two days wid dem inna Chicago.</p>
<p>Har husband, mongx various physical accomplishments, did a one a di most powerful ends weh eva play football a New Haven—a national figure in a way, one a dem man deh weh reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one dat everyting aftaward savors a anticlimax. Him family did enormously rich—even inna college him freedom wid money was a matter fi reproach—but now him did lef Chicago an come East inna a fashion weh radda tek yuh breath weh: fi example, him did bring dung a string a polo ponies fram Lake Forest. It did haad fi realize seh a man inna mi own generation did rich inof fi do dat.</p>
<p>Wa mek dem kom Iis mi no nuo. Dem did spen a year in France fi no particular reason, an den drift yah an deh unrestfully weh people did play polo an did rich tugeda. Dis was a permanent move, seh Daisy ova di telephone, but mi neva believe it—mi neva have no sight inna Daisy heart, but mi did feel seh Tom woulda drift on forever seeking, a likkle wistfully, fi di dramatic turbulence a some irrecoverable football game.</p>
<p>An so it happen dat pan a warm windy evening mi drive ova to East Egg fi see two old fren dem weh mi scarcely know at all. Dem yaad did even more elaborate dan mi did expect, a cheerful red-an-white Georgian Colonial mansion, weh did a look pan di bay. Di lawn staat a di beach an run towards di front door fi a quarter a mile, jump ova sundials an brick walks an burning gardens—finally wen it reach di house drifting up di side inna bright vines as if fram di momentum a it run. Di front did brok by a line a French windows, glowing now wid reflected gold an wide open to di warm windy aftanuun, an Tom Buchanan inna riding clothes did a stan up wid him legs apart pan di front porch.</p>
<p>Im did change since im New Haven years. Now him was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, wid a rather hard mout an a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes did establish dominance ova him face an gi him di appearance a always leaning aggressively forward. Not even di effeminate swank a him riding clothes coulda hide di enormous power a dat deh body—im did look like him did a fill dem glistening boots deh until him strain di top lacing, an yuh coulda see a great pack a muscle shifting wen him shoulda move unda him thin coat. A did a body capable a enormous leverage—a cruel body.</p>
<p>Him speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, did add to di impression a fractiousness weh him did a convey. It did have a touch a paternal contempt inna it, even toward people weh him did like—an deh did have man dem at New Haven weh did hate him guts.</p>
<p>“Now, no tink seh mi opinion pan dem ting deh a final,” him did a seh, “jus cause mi stronger an more a man dan yuh.” Wi did deh inna di same senior society, an while wi neva intimate mi always did have di impression seh him did approve a mi an did waan mi fi like him wid some harsh, defiant wistfulness a him own.</p>
<p>Wi talk fi a few minutes pan di sunny porch.</p>
<p>“Mi have a nice place yah,” him seh, him eyes dem a flash bout restlessly.</p>
<p>Turning mi roun by one arm, him move a broad flat han along di front vista, including inna it sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre a deep, pungent roses, an a snub-nosed motorboat weh bump di tide offshore.</p>
<p>“It belong to Demaine, di oil man.” Him turn mi roun again, politely an abruptly. “Wi a go inside.”</p>
<p>Wi walk chruu a high hallway inna a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound inna di house by French windows at either end. Di windows dem did ajar an gleaming white against di fresh grass outside weh did look like it did a grow likkle way inna di house. A breeze did a bluo chruu di room, did a bluo curtains inna one end an outa di neda one like pale flags, twisting dem up toward di frosted wedding-cake a di ceiling, an den ripple ova di wine-coloured rug, mek a shadow pan it as wind do pan di sea.</p>
<p>Di ongl completely stationary object inna di room was a enormous couch pan which two young women did a buoyed up as if upon an anchored balloon. Dem did inna wait, an dem dres did a ripple an a flatter as if dem did jus get blow back in afta a short flight roun di house. Mi mus did stan up fi a few moments a lisn to di whip an snap a di curtains an di groan a one picture pan di wall. Den deh did have a boom as Tom Buchanan shut di rear windows an di caught wind dead out bout di room, an di curtains an di rugs an di two young women dem balloon slowly to di floor.</p>
<p>Di younger a di two a did a stranger to mi. Shi did extend full length at har end a di divan, completely motionless, an wid har chin raise likkle, as if she did a balance someting pan it weh did quite likely fi fall. If she did si mi outa di corner a har eyes she did gi no hint a it—indeed, mi did almost surprised fi murmure an apology fi having disturb har by coming in.</p>
<p>Di ada gyal, Daisy, mek a attempt fi rise—shi lean likl bit forward wid a conscientious expression—den shi laugh, a absurd, charming likkle laugh, an mi laugh tu an come forward inna di room.</p>
<p>“Mi p-paralyzed wid happiness.”</p>
<p>Shi laaf agen, laik se shi se sopm we did wel witty, an shi uol mi an fi a moment, a luk op ina mi fies, a pramis se nobadi neva de ina di worl we shi so moch waahn si. Dat was a way she did have. Shi hint inna a murmur seh di surname a di balancing girl was Baker. (Mi hear it seh dat Daisy's murmur was only fi mek people lean toward har; an irrelevant criticism weh mek it no less charming.)</p>
<p>At any rate, Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nod at mi almost imperceptibly, an den quickly tip har head back again—di object she did a balance did obviously totter a likkle an gi har someting a fright. Again a sort a apology did a come to mi lips. Almost any exhibition a complete self-sufficiency draw a stunned tribute fram mi.</p>
<p>Mi look back pan mi cousin, weh staat ask mi kweschan inna har low, thrilling voice. A did di kain a voice weh di ear did a follow up an dung, as if each speech a one arrangement a notes weh nah go eva play again. Har face did sad an lovely wid bright tings inna it, bright eyes an a bright passionate mout, but deh did have a excitement inna har voice weh man dem weh did care fi har did find difficult fi forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise seh she did do gay, exciting tings jus a while since an dat deh did have gay tings, exciting houring inna di next hover.</p>
<p>Mi tell har how mi did stop off inna Chicago fi a day pan mi way East, an how a dozen people did sen dem love chruu mi.</p>
<p>“Dem miss mi?” she cry ecstatical.</p>
<p>“Di whole town desolate. All di cars have di left rear wheel paint black as a mourning wreath, an a persistent wail all night along di north shore.”</p>
<p>“How gorgeous! Mek wi go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Den she added irrelevantly: “Yuh shuda si di baby.”</p>
<p>“Mi woulda like fi.”</p>
<p>“Shi a sliip, shi a chrii ier uol, yu neva si ar yet?”</p>
<p>"Neva."</p>
<p>“Wel, yu shuda si ar. Shi a—”</p>
<p>Tom Buchanan, who did a hover restlessly bout di room, stop an rest him han pan mi shoulda.</p>
<p>“Weh yuh a duh, Nick?”</p>
<p>“Mi a one bond man.”</p>
<p>“A who wid?”</p>
<p>Mi tell him.</p>
<p>“Neva hear bout dem,” him remarked decisively.</p>
<p>Dis mek mi beks.</p>
<p>“Yuh wi,” mi ansa shortly. “Yuh wi if yuh stay inna di East.”</p>
<p>“Oh, mi ago stay inna di East, no bada worry,” him seh, glancing at Daisy an den back at mi, as if him did alert fi someting more. “Mi woulda be a God damned fool fi live anyweh else.”</p>
<p>At dis point Miss Baker seh: “Absolutely!” wid such suddenness dat mi staat—a did di first word she did seh since mi come inna di room. Evidently it surprise har as much as it did mi, fi she yawn an wid a series a rapid, deft movements stan up inna di room.</p>
<p>“Mi stiif,” shi komplien, “Mi a lidong pan da sofa de fi az lang az mi kyan memba.”</p>
<p>“No luk pan mi,” Daisy ansa bak, “mi a chrai get yu a Nyuu Yaak aal aftanuun.”</p>
<p>“No, tanks,” Mis Baker se tu di fuor koktel dem we did jos kom fram di panchri. “Mi absolutely inna training.”</p>
<p>Har host look pan har incredulously.</p>
<p>"Yuh a!" Im tek dong im drink as if it was a drop inna di bottom a one glass. “How yuh eva get anyting done is beyond mi.”</p>
<p>Mi look pan Miss Baker, a wanda weh it was she “get done.” Mi did enjoy look pan har. Shi was a slender, small-breasted girl, wid a erect carriage, weh she accentuate by throwing har body backward at di shoulders like a young cadet. Har grey sun-strained eyes look back at mi wid polite reciprocal curiosity outa a wan, charming, discontented face. It come to mi now seh mi did si har, or a picture a har, somwe before.</p>
<p>“Yuh live inna West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “Mi know somebody deh.”</p>
<p>“Mi nuh know a single—”</p>
<p>“Yuh haffi know Gatsby.”</p>
<p>“Gatsby?” Daisy demand. “Weh Gatsby?”</p>
<p>Bifuo mi coulda reply seh him a mi neighbor dinner did announce; wedging him tense arm imperatively unda mine, Tom Buchanan compel mi fram di room as if him did a move a checker to anodda square.</p>
<p>Slenderly, languidly, dem hands set lightly pan dem hips, di two young women dem precede wi out pan a rosy-coloured porch, open toward di sunset, weh four candles did a flicker pan di table inna di diminished wind.</p>
<p>“Why <i>candles</i> ?” Daisy object, frowning. Shi snap dem out wid har finga dem. “Inna two weeks it ago be di longest day inna di year.” Shi look pon wi all radiantly. “Yuh always watch fi di longest day a di year an den miss it? Mi always watch fi di longest day inna di year an den miss it.”</p>
<p>“Wi shuda plan somting,” Mis Baker yawn, a sidong a di tiebl laik se shi did a get inna bed.</p>
<p>“Aal rait,” Daisy seh. “Weh wi a go plan?” Shi ton to mi helplessly: “Weh people plan?”</p>
<p>Bifuo mi coulda ansa har eyes dem fasten wid a awed expression pan har likkle finga.</p>
<p>"Luk!" she complain; “Mi hurt it.”</p>
<p>Wi all look—di knuckle did black an blue.</p>
<p>“Yuh did do it, Tom,” she seh accusingly. “Mi know yuh neva mean fi, but yuh <i>did</i> do it. A dat mi get fi married a brute a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen a a—”</p>
<p>“Mi hate dat deh word 'hulking,' ” Tom objected crossly, “even inna kidding.”</p>
<p>“Hulking,” Daisy insist.</p>
<p>Somtaim shi an Mis Baker taak at once, unobtrusively an wid a bantering inconsequence weh neva quite chatter, weh did as cool as dem white dresses an dem impersonal eyes inna di absence a all desire. Dem did deh yah, an dem did accept Tom an mi, mek only a polite pleasant effort fi entertain or fi get entertain. Dem did know seh presently dinner woulda be ova an a likkle later di evening too woulda be ova an casually put weh. It was sharply different fram di West, weh an evening did a hurried fram phase to phase towards it close, inna a continually disappointed anticipation or else inna sheer nervous dread a di moment itself.</p>
<p>“Yuh mek mi feel uncivilized, Daisy,” mi confess pan mi secan glass a corky but rather impressive claret. “Yuh cyan talk bout crops or someting?”</p>
<p>Mi neva mean notn in particular by dis remark, but it did tek up inna an unexpected way.</p>
<p>“Civilization a go to pieces,” Tom break out violently. “Mi get fi be a terrible pessimist bout tings. Yuh read <i>The Rise of the Colored Empires</i> by dis man Goddard?”</p>
<p>“Why, no,” mi ansa, rada surprised by him tone.</p>
<p>“Well, a one fine book, an everybody fi read it. Di idea is if we nuh look out di white race ago be—will be utterly submerged. A all scientific stuff; it been proved.”</p>
<p>“Tom a get very profound,” seh Daisy, wid a expression a unthoughtful sadness. “Im read deep books wid long words inna dem. Weh was dat deh word we—”</p>
<p>“Well, dem book yah all scientific,” insist Tom, glancing at har impatiently. “Da man ya wok out di uol ting. A wi, uu a di muos impuotant piipl, fi wach out ar dem ada piipl ya a-go av kanchuol a tingz.”</p>
<p>“Wi haffi beat dem dung,” Daisy whisper, a wink ferociously toward di fervent sun.</p>
<p>“Yuh shuda live inna California—” staat Miss Baker, but Tom interrupt har by shifting heavily inna him chair.</p>
<p>“Dis idea is dat wi a Nordics. Mi a, an yuh a, an yuh a, an—” Afta a infinitesimal hesitation him include Daisy wid a slight nod, an she wink at mi again. “—An wi don produce all di tings dem weh go fi mek civilization—oh, science an art, an all dat. Yuh see?”</p>
<p>Somting pathetic did deh inna him concentration, as if him complacency, more acute dan of old, neva enough fi him no more. Wen, almost immediately, di telephone ring inside an di butler lef di porch Daisy seize upon di momentary interruption an lean towards mi.</p>
<p>“Mi ago tell yuh a family secret,” she whisper enthusiastically. “A bout di butla nuoz. Yu waahn ier bout di butla nuoz?”</p>
<p>“A dat mek mi kom uova tide nait.”</p>
<p>“Well, him neva always a butler; him use to be di silver polisher fi some people inna New York weh did have a silver service fi two hundred people. Him did haffi polish it fram morning til night, until finally it staat affect him nose—”</p>
<p>“Tings did go fram bad to worse,” Miss Baker suggest.</p>
<p>“Yes. Tings did a go fram bad to worse, til finally him did haffi gi up him position.”</p>
<p>Fi a moment di laas sunshine did a fall wid romantic affection pan har glowing face; har voice compel mi forward breathlessly as mi listen—den di glow fade, each light deserting har wid lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.</p>
<p>Di butler come back an murmured someting close to Tom's ear, whereupon Tom frown, push back him chair, an widout a word go inside. As if him absence quicken someting widin har, Daisy lean forward again, har voice glowing an singing.</p>
<p>“Mi love fi si yuh a mi table, Nick. Yuh remind mi a—a one rose, an absolute rose. Noh him?” Shi ton tu Mis Baker fi kanfamieshan: “An absolute rose?”</p>
<p>Dis neva true. Mi no even faintly like a rose. Shi did only a extemporizing, but a stirring warmth did a flow fram har, as if har heart did a try come out to yuh concealed inna one a dem breathless, thrilling words deh. Den suddenly shi fling har napkin pan di table an excuse harself an go inna di house.</p>
<p>Mis Baker an mi exchange a shaat glance consciously devoid a meaning. Mi did bout fi taak wen shi sidong op alert an se “ <i>Sh!</i> ” inna a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur did audible inna di room beyond, an Miss Baker did a lean forward unashamed, a try fi hear. Di murmur tremble pan di verge a coherence, sank dung, mount excitedly, an den cease altogether.</p>
<p>“Dis ya Mr. Gatsby weh yuh did a taak bout a mi neighbour—” mi staat.</p>
<p>“No bada taak, mi waahn ier wa apm.”</p>
<p>“Somting a gwaan?” Mi aks innocently.</p>
<p>“Yu miin fi se yu no nuo?” seh Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “Mi did tink everybody did know.”</p>
<p>"Mi nuh."</p>
<p>“Why—” she seh hesitantly. “Tom have some woman inna New York.”</p>
<p>“Yuh have some woman?” Mi repeat blankly.</p>
<p>Miss Baker nod.</p>
<p>“She might have di decency fi nuh telephone him at dinner time. Yuh nuh tink?”</p>
<p>Almost before mi did grab har meaning deh did have di flutter a one dress an di crunch a leather boots, an Tom an Daisy did deh back a di table.</p>
<p>“It couldn't be help!” Daisy baal out wid tense gaiety.</p>
<p>Shi sidong, glance searchingly at Miss Baker an den at mi, an continue: “Mi look outdoors fi a minute, an it very romantic outdoors. Deh deh a bird pan di lawn weh mi tink mosi a nightingale come ova pan di Cunard or White Star Line. Him a sing weh—” Har voice sing: “It's romantic, it's Tomn?”</p>
<p>“Very romantic,” him seh, an den miserably to mi: “If it light enough afta dinner, mi waan tek yuh dung to di stables.”</p>
<p>Di telephone ring inside, startlingly, an as Daisy shook har head decisively at Tom di subject a di stables, in fact all subjects, vanish inna air. Among di broken fragments dem a di laas five minutes at table mi memba di candles dem did a lait agen, pointlessly, an mi did conscious a wanting fi look squarely at everybody, an yet fi avoid all eyes. Mi couldn't guess weh Daisy an Tom did a tink, but mi doubt if even Miss Baker, weh did look like shi did master a certain hardy scepticism, did able utterly fi put dis fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency outa mind. Tu a certain temperament di situation mighta did look intriguing—mi own instinct was fi telephone immediately fi di police.</p>
<p>Di horses dem, needless fi seh, dem neva mention again. Tom an Miss Baker, wid several feet a twilight between dem, stroll back inna di library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying fi look pleasantly interested an a likkle deaf, mi did a follow Daisy roun a chain a connecting verandas to di porch in front. Inna it deep gloom wi did sidong side by side pan a wicker settee.</p>
<p>Daisy tek har face inna har han dem as if she did a feel it lovely shape, an har eyes dem move gradually out inna di velvet dusk. Mi si seh turbulent emotions possess har, so mi ask weh mi tink woulda be some sedative questions bout har likkle gyal.</p>
<p>“Wi nuh know each ada very well, Nick,” she seh suddenly. “Iivn duo wi a kozn. Yu neva kom a mi wedn.”</p>
<p>“Mi neva come back fram di war.”</p>
<p>“A chruu dat.” Shi did a hesitate. “Well, mi have a very bad time, Nick, an mi pretty cynical bout everyting.”</p>
<p>Evidently she did have reason fi be. Mi wait but she neva seh notn more, an afta a moment mi return rather feebly to di subject a har daughta.</p>
<p>“Mi suppose she talk, an—eat, an everyting.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes.” Shi look pan mi absently. “Lisn, Nick; mek mi tel yu wa mi se wen shi baan. Yu wuda laik fi ier?”</p>
<p>“Very much.”</p>
<p>“It ago shuo yuh how mi get fi feel bout—tings. Well, shi did less dan wan owa uol an Tom did deh God knows weh. Mi wake up outa di ether wid a utterly abandoned feeling, an ask di nurse right away if a did a bwoy or a gyal. Shi tell mi seh a did a gyal, an so mi ton mi head weh an we apt'All'rait, mi se glam. a gyal. An mi hope she ago be a fool—dat a di bes ting a gyal can be inna dis ya worl, a beautiful likkle fool.'</p>
<p>“Yuh see mi tink everyting terrible anyhow,” she goh on inna a convinced way. “Everybody tink so—di most advanced people. An mi <i>know</i> . Mi been everyweh an see everyting an done everyting.” Har eyes dem flash roun har inna a defiant way, radda like Tom's, an she laugh wid thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, mi sophisticated!”</p>
<p>Di instant har voice break off, ceasing fi compel mi attention, mi belief, mi feel di basic insincerity a weh she did seh. It mek mi uneasy, as if di whole evening was a trick a some sort fi exact a contributory emotion fram mi. Mi wait, an sure enough, inna a moment she look pon mi wid an absolute smirk pan har lovely face, as if she did assert har membership inna a rather distinguished secret society weh she an Tom belong to.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Inside, di crimson room did a bloom wid light. Tom an Miss Baker did sidong a either end a di lang couch an shi did a read loud to him fram di <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> —di wod dem, murmurous an uninflected, a run tugeda inna a soothing tune. Di lamplight, bright pan him boots an dull pan di autumn-leaf yellow a har hair, glinted along di paper as she turn a page wid a flutter a slender muscles inna har arms.</p>
<p>Wen wi come in she hold wi silent fi a moment wid a lifted han.</p>
<p>“Fi be continued,” she seh, tossing di magazine pan di table, “inna wi very next issue.”</p>
<p>Har body asserted itself wid a restless movement a har knee, an she stan up.</p>
<p>“Ten o'clock,” she remarked, apparently find di time pan di ceiling. “A time fi dis good girl go a bed.”</p>
<p>“Jordan a go play inna di tournament tomorrow,” Daisy explain, “ova a Westchester.”</p>
<p>“Oh—yuh a <i>Jor</i> dan Baker.”</p>
<p>Mi did know now why har face did familiar—it pleasing contemptuous expression did look out at mi fram plenty rotogravure pictures a di sporting life at Asheville an Hot Springs an Palm Beach. Mi did hear some story bout har too, a critical, unpleasant story, but weh it was mi did forget long ago.</p>
<p>“Gud night,” she seh softly. “Wake mi at eight, yuh noh.”</p>
<p>“If yuh get up.”</p>
<p>“Mi wi. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See yuh anon.”</p>
<p>“Af course yuh wi,” Daisy confirmed. “In fact mi tink mi ago arrange a marriage. Come ova often, Nick, an mi ago sort a—oh—fling yuh tugeda. Yuh know—lock yuh up accidentally inna linen closets an push yuh out to sea inna a boat, an all dat deh sort a ting—”</p>
<p>“Gud nait,” Mis Baker kaal fram di stier. “Mi neva hear a word.”</p>
<p>“Shi a nais gyal,” Tamas se afta a likl wail. “Dem shudn't fi mek har run roun di country dis way.”</p>
<p>“A who shudn't?” Daisy aks coldly.</p>
<p>“Har family.”</p>
<p>“Har family a one aunt bout a thousand years old. Besides, Nick a go look afta har, noh true, Nick? She a go spen lots a weekends out yah dis summer. Mi tink di home influence ago be very good fi har.”</p>
<p>Daisy an Tom look pan each ada fi a moment inna silence.</p>
<p>“She come fram New York?” Mi ask quickly.</p>
<p>“From Louisville. Our white girlhood did pass tugeda deh. Our beautiful white—”</p>
<p>“Yuh did gi Nick a likkle heart to heart talk pan di veranda?” Tom demand suddenly.</p>
<p>“Mi did?” Shi look pon mi. “Mi cyan seem fi memba, but mi tink we did a talk bout di Nordic race. Yes, mi sure wi did. It sort a crept up pan wi an first ting yuh know—”</p>
<p>“No biliiv evriting yu ier, Nick,” im advaiz mi.</p>
<p>Mi seh lightly seh mi neva hear notn at all, an a few minutes later mi get up fi go home. Dem come to di door wid mi an stan up side by side inna a cheerful square a light. As mi staat mi motor Daisy peremptorily call: “Wait!</p>
<p>“Mi figet fi aks yu sopm, an it impuotant. Wi ier se yu did ingiej tu wahn gyal outa Wes.”</p>
<p>“A so it go,” Tom corroborated kindly. “Wi hear seh yuh did engaged.”</p>
<p>“A wan libel. Mi tuu puor.”</p>
<p>“But wi hear it,” insist Daisy, surprising mi by opening up again inna a flower-like way. “Wi hear it fram three people, so it mosi be true.”</p>
<p>Aal av a sudden mi did know weh dem did a refer to, but mi neva even vaguely engaged. Di fact dat gossip did publish di banns was one a di reasons mi did come East. Yuh cyaan stop go wid a old fren pan account a rumors, an pan di ada han mi neva have no intention fi get rumors inna marriage.</p>
<p>Dem interest rather touch mi an mek dem less rich—nevertheless, mi did confused an a likkle disgusted as mi did a drive weh. It did look like di ting fi Daisy do was fi rush outa di house, pikni inna arms—but apparently deh neva have no such intentions inna har head. As fi Tom, di fact dat him “had some woman inna New York” was really less surprising dan dat him did get depressed by a book. Somting did a mek him nibble at di edge a stale ideas as if him sturdy physical egotism neva nourish him peremptory heart no more.</p>
<p>Alredy it was deep summer pan roadhouse roofs an inna front a wayside garages, weh new red petrol-pumps did a sidong out inna pools a light, an wen mi reach mi estate at West Egg mi run di car unda it shed an sidong fi a while pan a abandoned grass roller inna di yard. Di wind did blow off, lef a loud, bright night, wid wings a beat inna di trees an a persistent organ sound as di full bellows a di earth did a blow di frogs full a life. Di silhouette a one moving cat did a waver across di moonlight, an, wen mi did a turn mi head fi watch it, mi si seh mi neva deh alone—fifty feet weh a figure did a come outa di shadow a mi neighbour's mansion an did a stan op wid him han dem inna him pocket regarding di silver pepper a di stars. Somting inna him leisurely movements an di secure position a him foot dem pan di lawn suggest seh a Mr. Gatsby himself, come out fi determine weh share him did have a wi local heavens.</p>
<p>Mi decide fi call him. Miss Baker did mention him at dinner, an dat woulda do fi an introduction. But mi neva call to him, cause him did a gi mi a sudden intimation seh him did content fi deh alone—im stretch out him arms toward di dark wata inna a curious way, an, far as mi did deh fram him, mi coulda sworn seh him did a tremble. Involuntarily mi glance seaward—an distinguish notn except a single green light, minute an far away, dat mighta did a di end a one dock. Wen mi look once more fi Gatsby him did vanish, an mi did deh alone again inna di unquiet darkness.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<p>Bout halfway between West Egg an New York di motor road hastily join di railroad an run beside it fi a quarter a mile, so as fi shrink weh fram a certain desolate area a lan. Dis a one valley a ashes—a fantastic farm weh ashes grow like wheat into ridges an hills an grotesque gardens; weh ashes tek di forms a house an chimney an rising smoke an, finally, wid a transcendent effort, a ash-grey man, weh move dimly an already a crumbling chruu di powdery air. Wan taim wan lain a griin kyaar kraal pan wan invisibl chrak, gi out wan ghastly kriik, an kom fi res, an siem taim di ash-griin man dem swarm op wid liidn spaid an stir op wan impenetrable klaud, we skriin dem obskyuor opreshan fram yu siit.</p>
<p>But above di grey lan an di spasms a bleak dust weh drift endlessly ova it, yuh perceive, afta a moment, di eyes a Doctor TJ Eckleburg. Di eyes a Doctor TJ Eckleburg blue an gigantic—dem retinas a one yard high. Dem look out a no face, but, instead, fram a pair a enormous yellow spectacles weh pass ova a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag a one oculist set dem deh fi fatten him practice inna di borough a Queens, an den sink dung himself inna eternal blindness, or forget dem an move weh. But him eyes, dimmed a likkle by many paintless days, unda sun an rain, brood on ova di solemn dumping ground.</p>
<p>Di valley a ashes is bounded pan one side by a likkle foul river, an, wen di drawbridge deh up fi let barges through, di passengers pan waiting trains can stare at di dismal scene fi as long as half an hour. It always have a halt deh fi at least a minute, an a because a dis mek mi first meet Tom Buchanan's mistress.</p>
<p>Di fact dat him did have one did a insist pan weh him did know. Him acquaintances did resent di fact dat him did turn up inna popular cafés wid har an, lef har at a table, sauntered bout, a chat wid whomsoever him did know. Though mi did curious fi si har, mi neva have no desire fi meet har—but mi did. Mi go op a New York wid Tom pan di train one aftanuun, an wen wi stap bai di ash-heaps im jomp op pan im fut dem an, tek hold a mi elbow, literally fuos mi outa di kyaar.</p>
<p>“Wi a get aaf,” im insis. “Mi waan yuh fi meet mi girl.”</p>
<p>Mi tink him did tank up a good deal at luncheon, an him determination fi have mi company bordered pan violence. Di supercilious assumption was dat pan Sunday aftanuun mi neva have nutten beta fi do.</p>
<p>Mi follow him ova a low whitewashed railroad fence, an wi walk back a hundred yards along di road unda Doctor Eckleburg's persistent stare. Di ongl building inna di sight was a likkle block a yellow brick weh did a sidong pan di edge a di waste lan, a sort a compact Main Street weh did a minister to it, an contiguous to absolutely nutten. One a di three shops dem weh it did have was fi rent an anodda one was a all-night restaurant, approached by a trail a ashes; di third one was a garage— <i>Repairs.</i> <b>George B. Wilson.</b> <i>Cars buy an sell.</i> —an mi fala Tom inside.</p>
<p>Di interior did unprosperous an bare; di ongl car weh wi did si was di dust-covered wreck a one Ford weh did a crouch inna a dim corner. It did come to mi seh dis shadow a garage mus be a blind, an dat sumptuous an romantic apartments did a conceal ovahead, wen di proprietor himself appear inna di door a one office, a wipe him han dem pan a piece a waste. Im was a blond, spiritless man, anemic, an faintly handsome. Wen him si wi a damp gleam a hope sprang inna him light blue eyes.</p>
<p>“Hello, Wilson, old man,” seh Tom, slap him jovially pan di shoulda. “How's business?”</p>
<p>“Mi cyan complain,” Wilson ansa unconvincingly. “Wen yuh a go sell mi dat deh car?”</p>
<p>“Next week; mi have mi man a work pan it now.”</p>
<p>“Im work pretty slow, noh true?”</p>
<p>“No, him nuh,” Tom seh coldly. “An if yuh feel dat way bout it, maybe mi woulda better sell it somwe else afta all.”</p>
<p>“Mi nuh mean dat,” Wilson explain quickly. “Mi jus mean—”</p>
<p>Him voice fade off an Tom glance impatiently roun di garage. Den mi hear footsteps pan a stairs, an inna a moment di thickish figure a one woman block out di light fram di office door. Shi did inna di middle thirties, an faintly stout, but shi did a carry har flesh sensuously as some women can. Har face, above a spotted dress a dark blue crêpe-de-chine, neva have no facet or gleam a beauty, but it did have an immediately perceptible vitality bout har as if di nerves a har body did a continually smouldering. Shi smile slowly an, walk chruu har husband as if him a did a ghost, shiek han wid Tom, looking him flush inna di eye. Den she wet har lips, an widout turn roun shi taak to har husband inna a soft, coarse voice:</p>
<p>“Get some chairs, why yuh nuh, so somebody can sit dung.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure,” Wilson agree hurriedly, an go toward di likkle office, a mix immediately wid di cement color a di walls. A white ashen dust veil him dark suit an him pale hair as it veil everyting inna di vicinity—except him wife, weh did move close to Tom.</p>
<p>“Mi waan see yuh,” Tom seh intently. “Get pan di next train.”</p>
<p>"Arite."</p>
<p>“Mi wi meet yuh by di newsstan pan di lower level.”</p>
<p>Shi nod an move weh fram him jus as George Wilson come out wid two chairs fram him office door.</p>
<p>Wi wait fi har dung di road an out a sight. A did a few days before di Fourth a July, an a grey, scrawny Italian pikni did a set torpedoes inna a row along di railroad track.</p>
<p>“Terrible place, noh true,” seh Tom, exchange a frown wid Doctor Eckleburg.</p>
<p>"Awful."</p>
<p>“It do har good fi get weh.”</p>
<p>“Ar husband nuh object?”</p>
<p>"Wilson? Him tink she goh see har sista a New York. Him so dumb him nuh know seh him alive."</p>
<p>So Tom Buchanan an him gyal an mi go op tugeda a New York—or not quite tugeda, fi Mrs. Wilson did sidong discreetly inna wan neda car. Tom defer dat much to di sensibilities a dem East Eggers weh might be pan di train.</p>
<p>Shi did change har dress to a brown figured muslin, weh did stretch tight ova har rather wide hips as Tom did a help har to di platform inna New York. At di newsstan she buy a copy a <i>Town Tattle</i> an a moving-picture magazine, an inna di station drugstore some cold cream an a likkle flask a perfume. Upstairs, inna di solemn echoing drive she mek four taxicabs drive weh before she pick a new one, lavender-coloured wid gray upholstery, an inna dis we slid out fram di mass a di station inna di glowing sunshine. But immediately she turn sharply fram di window an, leaning forward, tap pan di front glass.</p>
<p>“Mi waan get one a dem dog deh,” she seh earnestly. “Mi waahn get wan fi di apaatment. Dem nais fi av—a daag.”</p>
<p>Wi back up to a gray old man weh did a bear an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. Inna a basket swing fram him neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies a one indeterminate breed.</p>
<p>“Weh kain dem?” aks Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as him come to di taxi-window.</p>
<p>“All kinds. Weh kain yuh waan, lady?”</p>
<p>“Mi wuda laik fi get wan a dem poliis daag de; mi no tingk yu get da kain de?”</p>
<p>Di man peer doubtfully inna di basket, plunge inna him han an draw one up, wriggling, by di back a di neck.</p>
<p>“A no poliis daag dat,” Tom se.</p>
<p>“Nuo, a no egzakli poliis daag,” di man se wid disappointment ina im vais. “A muor a wan Airedale.” Im pass im han ova di brown washrag a one back. “Luk pan da kuot de. Som kuot. Dat a wan daag we naa go eva bada yu wid kech kuol.”</p>
<p>“Mi tink it cute,” seh Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much it is?”</p>
<p>“Da dog deh?” Im look pon it admiringly. “Da dog deh ago cost yuh ten dollars.”</p>
<p>Di Airedale—undoubtedly deh did have an Airedale concerned inna it somweh, though it foot dem did startlingly white—change han an settle dung inna Mrs. Wilson lap, weh she fondle di weatherproof coat wid rapture.</p>
<p>“A bwai ar gyal?” she ask delicately.</p>
<p>“Da daag de? Dat de daag a wan bwaai pikni.”</p>
<p>“A bitch,” Tom seh decisively. “Si yu moni ya, go bai ten muor daag wid it.”</p>
<p>Wi drive ova to Fifth Avenue, warm an soft, almost pastoral, pan di summer Sunday aftanuun. Mi wudn sopraiz fi si wahn big gruup a wait shiip ton di kaana.</p>
<p>“Hold on,” mi seh, “mi haffi lef yuh yah.”</p>
<p>“No yuh nuh,” Tom interposed quickly. “Myrtle ago get hurt if yuh nuh come up to di apartment. Yuh naa go, Myrtle?”</p>
<p>“Come on,” she urge. “Mi a go telephone mi sista Catherine. Dem seh shi very beautiful by people weh shuda know.”</p>
<p>“Well, mi woulda like fi, but—”</p>
<p>Wi go on, cutting back again ova di Park toward di West Hundreds. At 158th Street di cab stop at one slice inna a long white cake a apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance roun di neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gather up har dog an har other purchases, an go haughtily in.</p>
<p>“Mi a go mek di McKees dem come up,” she announce as wi rise inna di elevator. “An, a chuu, mi got fi call up mi sista, too.”</p>
<p>Di apartment did deh pan di top floor—a likkle living-room, a likkle dining-room, a likkle bedroom, an a bath. Di living-room did crowd to di doors wid a set a tapestried furniture entirely too large fi it, so dat fi move bout was fi stumble continually ova scenes a ladies swinging inna di gardens a Versailles. Di ongl picture was a over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting pan a blurred rock. Wen yuh look pan it fram a distance, however, di hen resolve itself inna a bonnet, an di countenance a one stout old lady beam dung inna di room. Several old copies a <i>Town Tattle</i> did deh pan di table tugeda wid a copy a <i>Simon Called Peter</i> , an some a di likkle scandal magazines dem a Broadway. Mrs. Wilson did fos concern wid di dog. A reluctant elevator bwoy go fi a box full a straw an some milk, to which him add pan him own initiative a tin a big, hard dog biscuits—one a weh did decompose apathetical inna di saucer a milk all aftanuun. Meanwhile Tom bring out a bottle a whiskey fram a locked bureau door.</p>
<p>Mi don jringk jos tuu taim inna mi laif, an di sekan taim a dat de aftanuun; so everyting weh happen have a dim, hazy cast ova it, although until afta eight o'clock di apartment did full a cheerful sun. Sidong pan Tom lap Mrs. Wilson call up several people pan di telephone; den no sigaret neva de de, an mi go out fi bai som a di jrog ous pan di kaana. Wen mi come back dem did disappear, so mi sidong discreetly inna di living-room an read a chapter a <i>Simon Called Peter</i> —either it was terrible stuff or di whiskey distorted tings, cause it neva mek no sense to mi.</p>
<p>Jus as Tom an Myrtle (afta di first drink Mrs. Wilson an mi did call each ada by wi first names) reappear, company staat fi arrive a di apartment door.</p>
<p>Di sista, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of thirty, wid a solid, sticky bob a red hair, an a complexion powdered milky white. Har eyebrows dem did pluck an den draw on again at a more rakish angle, but di efforts a nature toward di restoration a di old alignment gi har a blurred air to har face. Wen she move bout deh did a click incessant as innumerable pottery bracelets did a jingle up an dung pan har arms. Shi come in wid such a proprietary haste, an look roun so possessively at di furniture dat mi did a wanda if she did live yah. But wen mi ask har she laugh immoderately, repeat mi kweschan loud, an tell mi seh she live wid a girl fren a one hotel.</p>
<p>Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man fram di flat below. Im did jus shave, cause a did a white spot a lather pan im cheekbone, an im did most respectful inna im greeting to everybody inna di room. Im tell mi seh im did deh inna di “artistic game,” an mi gather later seh im a one photographer an im did mek di dim enlargement a Mrs. Wilson mada weh did a hover like an ectoplasm pan di wall. Him wife did shrill, languid, handsome, an horrible. Shi tell mi wid pride seh har husband did tek har picture a hundred an twenty-seven times since dem did married.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson did change har costume some time before, an did now attired inna one elaborate afternoon dress a cream-coloured chiffon, weh did a gi out a continual rustle as she swept bout di room. Wid di influence a di dress har personality did also undergo a change. Di intense vitality weh did so remarkable inna di garage did convert inna impressive hauteur. Har laughter, har gestures, har assertions dem did a get more violently affected moment by moment, an as she expand di room did a grow smaller roun har, until she did a look like shi did a revolve pan a noisy, creaking pivot chruu di smoky air.</p>
<p>“Mi dear,” she tell har sista inna a high, mincing shout, “most a dem fellas yah ago cheat yuh every time. All dem tink bout a money. Mi did have a woman up yah last week fi look pon mi feet, an wen she gi mi di bill yuh woulda tink she did have mi appendicitis out.”</p>
<p>“Weh di woman did name?” Mrs. McKee aks.</p>
<p>“Misis Eberhardt. Shi go roun a luk pan piipl fut inna dem uona yaad.”</p>
<p>“Mi like yuh dress,” Mrs. McKee seh, “mi tink it adorable.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson did reject di compliment by rasing har eyebrow inna disdain.</p>
<p>“A jus a crazy ole ting,” she seh. “Mi jus slip it on sometimes wen mi nuh care how mi look.”</p>
<p>“But it look wonderful pan yuh, if yuh know weh mi mean,” Mrs. McKee pursued. “If Chester coulda only get yuh inna dat deh pose mi tink him coulda mek someting a it.”</p>
<p>Wi all look inna silence pan Mrs. Wilson, weh tek weh a strand a hair fram ova har eyes an look back pan wi wid a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee look har intently wid him head pan one side, an den move him han back an forth slowly inna front a him face.</p>
<p>“Mi shuda change di light,” him seh afta a moment. “Mi woulda like fi bring out di modeling a di features. An mi woulda try fi get hold a all di back hair.”</p>
<p>“Mi wudn tingk bout chienj di lait,” Misis McKee baal out. “Mi tink it's—”</p>
<p>Har husband seh “ <i>Sh!</i> ” an wi all look pon di subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly an get up him foot dem.</p>
<p>“Unu McKees have someting fi drink,” him seh. “Get some more ice an mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody go to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Mi tell dat deh bwoy bout di ice.” Myrtle raise har eyebrows inna despair at di shiftlessness a di lower orders. “Dem piipl ya! Unu afi kip aan a fala dem aal di taim.”</p>
<p>Shi look pan mi an laugh pointlessly. Den she flounced ova to di dog, kiss it wid ecstasy, an sweep inna di kitchen, imply seh a dozen chefs did a wait har orders deh.</p>
<p>“Mi don do some nice tings out pan Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.</p>
<p>Tom look pan him blankly.</p>
<p>“Two a dem we have frame dungstairs.”</p>
<p>“Two weh?” Tom demand.</p>
<p>“Two studies. One a dem mi call <i>Montauk Point—The Gulls</i> , an di ada one mi call <i>Montauk Point—Di Sea</i> .”</p>
<p>Di sista Catherine did sidong saida mi pan di sofa.</p>
<p>“Yuh live dung pan Long Island, too?” shi aks.</p>
<p>“Mi live a West Egg.”</p>
<p>“Really? Mi did deh dung deh a one party bout a month ago. A one man name Gatsby's. Yuh know him?”</p>
<p>“Mi live next to him.”</p>
<p>“Wel, dem se im a nieba ar kozn a Kaiser Wilhelm. A de so aal a im moni kom fram.”</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Shi nod.</p>
<p>“Mi fried a im. Mi wuda iet fi im get notn pan mi.”</p>
<p>Dis absorbing information bout mi neighbor was interrupted by Mrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:</p>
<p>“Chester, mi tink yuh coulda do someting wid <i>har</i> ,” she break out, but Mr. McKee only nod inna a bored way, an turn him attention to Tom.</p>
<p>“Mi woulda like fi do more work pan Long Island, if mi coulda get di entry. All mi a ask is dat dem fi gi mi a start.”</p>
<p>“Ask Myrtle,” Tom seh, an a break inna a shaat shout a laughter as Mrs. Wilson did a go iin wid a tray. “She ago gi yuh a letta a introduction, noh true, Myrtle?”</p>
<p>“Du weh?” she ask, startled.</p>
<p>“Yuh ago gi McKee a letta a introduction to yuh husband, so him can do some studies a him.” Him lips dem move silently fi a moment as him invent, “ 'George B. Wilson at di Gasoline Pump,' or someting like dat.”</p>
<p>Catherine lean close to mi an whisper inna mi ear:</p>
<p>“None a dem cyaan stan di person dem married to.”</p>
<p>“Dem cyan?”</p>
<p>“Chan't <i>stan</i> dem.” Shi look pan Myrtle an den pan Tom. “Wa mi a se a dat, wa mek unu fi a liv wid dem ef dem kyaahn stan dem? Ef mi a did dem mi wuda get divors an get marid tu unu wan aneda rait ya so.”</p>
<p>“She nuh like Wilson either?”</p>
<p>Di ansa to dis was unexpected. It come fram Myrtle, who did hear di kweschan, an it did violent an obscene.</p>
<p>“Yuh si,” Catherine baal out triumphantly. Shi lower har voice again. “A fi im waif riili a kip dem wan aneda. Shi a Kyaklik, an dem no biliiv iina divors.”</p>
<p>Daisy neva a Catholic, an mi did a likkle shock at di elaborateness a di lie.</p>
<p>“Wen dem do get married,” Catherine continued, “dem a go West fi live fi a while until it blow ova.”</p>
<p>“It woulda be more discreet fi go a Europe.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yuh like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “Mi jus come back fram Monte Carlo.”</p>
<p>"Really."</p>
<p>“Jos laas ier. Mi go uova de wid wan neda gyal.”</p>
<p>“Stay lang?”</p>
<p>“No, wi jus go a Monte Carlo an back. Wi go by way a Marseilles. Wi did have ova twelve hundred dollars wen wi staat, but wi get gyped outa it all inna two days inna di private rooms. Wi did have a owful time a get back, mi can tell yuh. God, how mi did hate dat deh town!”</p>
<p>Di late aftanuun sky bloom inna di window fi a moment like di blue honey a di Mediterranean—den di shrill voice a Mrs. McKee call mi back inna di room.</p>
<p>“Mi almost mek a mistake, too,” she declare vigorously. “Mi almost married a likkle kike weh did a look afta mi fi years. Mi did know seh him did deh unda mi. Everybody did a keep seh to mi: 'Lucille, dat deh man deh way unda yuh!' But if mi neva meet Chester, him woulda get mi sure.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but lisn,” Myrtle Wilson seh, a nod har head up an dung, “at least yuh neva married him.”</p>
<p>“Mi know mi neva.”</p>
<p>“Well, mi married him,” seh Myrtle, ambiguously. “An dat a di difference between yuh case an mine.”</p>
<p>“Why yuh did, Myrtle?” Catherine demand. “Nobody neva force yuh fi do.”</p>
<p>Myrtle did consider.</p>
<p>“Mi married him cause mi did tink him a one gentleman,” she seh finally. “Mi did tink him did know someting bout breeding, but him neva fit fi lick mi shoe.”</p>
<p>“Yuh did crazy bout him fi a while,” seh Catherine.</p>
<p>“Crazy bout him!” Myrtle baal out incredulously. “A who seh mi did crazy bout him? Mi neva did crazy bout him more dan mi did bout da man deh deh.”</p>
<p>Shi point suddenly at mi, an everybody look pan mi accusingly. Mi try fi show by mi expression seh mi neva expect no affection.</p>
<p>“Di ongl <i>crazy</i> mi did a wen mi married him. Mi did know right away seh mi did mek a mistake. Him did borrow somebody's bes suit fi get married inna, an neva even tell mi bout it, an di man come afta it one day wen him did out: 'Oh, a dat yuh suit?' Mi seh. 'Dis a di first time mi eva hear bout it.' But mi gi'im it an den mi lidong an baal fi biit di band aal aftanuun.”</p>
<p>“She really shuda get weh fram him,” Catherine resume to mi. “Dem a liv uova dat de gyaabij fi ilevn ier. An Tom a di fos swiiti shi eva av.”</p>
<p>Di bottle a whisky—a secan one—was now inna constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who “felt jus as good pan nutten at all.” Tom ring fi di janitor an sen him fi some celebrated sandwiches, weh was a complete supper inna demself. Mi did waan get out an walk eastward toward di park thru di soft twilight, but every time mi try fi go mi did get entangled inna some wild, strident argument weh did pull mi back, as if wid ropes, inna mi chair. Yet high ova di city wi line a yellow windows mus did contribute dem share a human secrecy to di casual watcher inna di darkening streets, an mi si him too, a look up an a wanda. Mi did deh widin an widout, simultaneously enchanted an repelled by di inexhaustible variety a life.</p>
<p>Myrtle pull har chair close to mine, an suddenly har warm breath pour ova mi di story a har first meeting wid Tom.</p>
<p>“A did pan di two likkle seats dem weh did a face each ada weh aalwiez a di laas wan dem weh lef pan di train. Mi did a go op a New York fi si mi sista an spen di nait. Im did av aan a dress suit an patent leather shoes, an mi kudn kip mi yai dem aaf a im, bot evritaim im luk pan mi mi did afi priten se mi a luk pan di advertisement uova im ed. mi, an him white shirtfront press against mi arm, an so mi tell him seh mi woulda haffi call a policeman, but him did know seh mi did a lie mi did so excited dat wen mi get inna a taxi wid him mi neva hardly know seh mi neva did a get inna a subway train, all mi did a tink bout, ova an ova, was 'yuh can't live forever. ”</p>
<p>Shi ton to Mrs. McKee an di room ring full a har artificial laughter.</p>
<p>“Mi dier,” shi baal out, “Mi a go gi yu dis ya jres ya az suun az mi don wid it. Mi afi get wan neks wan tumaro. Mi a go mek wan lis a aal a di sitn dem we mi afi get. Wan maasaaj an wan wiev, an wan kaala fi di daag, an wan a dem kiet likl aashchri we yu toch wan spring, wan blak sier griev wid wan sista griev fi mada bwai dat ago last all summer. mi haffi write dung a list so mi naa go forget all di tings weh mi haffi do.”</p>
<p>A did nine o'clock—almost immediately aftaward mi look pan mi watch an find out seh a did ten. Mr. McKee did a sleep pan a chair wid him fist dem clenched inna him lap, like a photograph a one man a action. Tek out mi handkerchief an wipe fram him cheek di spot a dry lather weh did a worry mi all di aftanuun.</p>
<p>Di likl daag did a sidong pan di tiebl a luk wid blain yai chuu di sumuok, an fram taim tu taim a gruon likl. People disappear, reappear, mek plans fi go somewhere, an den lost each other, search fi each other, find each other a few feet weh. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan an Mrs. Wilson did a stan up face to face a discuss, inna impassioned voices, weda Mrs. Wilson did have any right fi mention Daisy's name.</p>
<p>“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” Mrs. Wilson shout. “Mi wi se it enitaim mi waahn! Daisy! Dai—”</p>
<p>Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan break har nose wid him open han.</p>
<p>Den deh did have bloody towels pan di bathroom floor, an women's voices a scold, an high ova di confusion a long broken wail a pain. Mr. McKee wake up fram him doze an staat inna a daze toward di door. Wen him did go halfway him ton roun an stare pan di scene—im wife an Catherine a scold an a console as dem stumble yah an deh mongst di crowded furniture wid articles a aid, an di despairing figure pan di couch, a blee fluently, an a try spread a copy a <i>Town Tattle</i> ova di tapestry scenes a Versailles scenes. Den Mr. McKee turn an continue on out di door. Mi tek mi hat fram di chandelier, an fala.</p>
<p>“Come to lunch some day,” him suggest, as we groan dung inna di elevator.</p>
<p>"Weh?"</p>
<p>“Eniwe.”</p>
<p>“Keep yuh han dem off di lever,” di elevator bwoy snapped.</p>
<p>“Mi beg yuh pardon,” seh Mr. McKee wid dignity, “mi neva know seh mi did a touch it.”</p>
<p>“Aal rait,” mi grii, “mi wi glad fi.”</p>
<p>… Mi did a stan op saida im bed an im did a sidong op bitwiin di shiit dem, jres op ina im andawear, wid wahn big puochret ina im an dem.</p>
<p>“Beauty an di Beast… Loneliness… Old Grocery Horse… Brook’n Bridge…”</p>
<p>Den mi did a lay half asleep inna di cold lower level a di Pennsylvania Station, a stare at di morning <i>Tribune</i> , an a wait fi di four o'clock train.</p>
