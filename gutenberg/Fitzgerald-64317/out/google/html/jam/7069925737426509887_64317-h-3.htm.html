<h2>VII</h2>
<p>A did wen curiosity bout Gatsby did deh at it highest dat di lights inna him house did fail fi go on one Saturday night—an, as obscurely as it did staat, him career as Trimalchio did don. Only gradually did mi become aware seh di automobiles dem weh did turn expectantly inna him drive did stay fi jus a minute an den drive sulkily weh. Mi did a wanda if him did sick mi go ova fi find out—an butler weh mi neva know wid a villainous face did a squint at mi suspiciously fram di door.</p>
<p>“Mista Gatsby sik?”</p>
<p>"Nat at all." Afta a pause him add “sir” inna a dilatory, grudging way.</p>
<p>“Mi neva si him roun, an mi did rada worry. Tell him Mr. Carraway did come ova.”</p>
<p>"Who?" him demand rudely.</p>
<p>“Carraway.”</p>
<p>“Karaway. Aal rait, mi wi tel im.”</p>
<p>Abruptly him slam di door.</p>
<p>Mi Finn tell mi seh Gatsby did dismiss every servant inna him house a week ago an replace dem wid half a dozen others, who neva go inna West Egg village fi get bribe by di tradesmen, but order moderate supplies ova di telephone. Di grocery bwoy report seh di kitchen look like a pigsty, an di general opinion inna di village was seh di new people dem neva servant at all.</p>
<p>Neks die Gatsby kaal mi pan di fuon.</p>
<p>“Yuh a go weh?” Mi aks.</p>
<p>“No, old sport.”</p>
<p>“Mi hear seh yuh did fire all a yuh servants.”</p>
<p>“Mi did waahn sumadi we naa gosip. Daisy kom uova nof taim—ina di aftanuun dem.”</p>
<p>So di whole caravansary did fall in like a card house at di disapproval inna har eyes.</p>
<p>“Dem a some people Wolfshiem did waan do someting fi. Dem a all bredda an sista. Dem use to run a likkle hotel.”</p>
<p>"Mi si."</p>
<p>Im did a call up pan Daisy's request—mi woulda come lunch a har yaad tomorrow? Miss Baker woulda deh deh. Half an hour later Daisy harself telephone an shi did look relieved fi find out seh mi did a come. Somting did up. An yet mi couldn't believe seh dem woulda choose dis occasion fi a scene—especially fi di rather harrowing scene weh Gatsby did outline inna di garden.</p>
<p>Di neks die did a broiling, almost di laas, certainly di warmest, a di summer. As mi train did a come outa di tunnel inna sunlight, only di hot whistles a di National Biscuit Company did a break di simmering hush at noon. Di straw seats a di car did a hover pan di edge a combustion; di woman next to mi perspired delicately fi a while inna har white shirtwaist, an den, as har newspaper dampened unda har fingers, lapsed despairingly inna deep heat wid a desolate cry. Har pocketbook slap to di floor.</p>
<p>“Oh, mi!” shi gasp.</p>
<p>Mi pick it up wid a weary bend an gi it back to har, holding it at arm's length an by di extreme tip a di corners fi indicate seh mi neva have no designs pan it—but everybody near by, including di woman, did suspect mi jus di same.</p>
<p>"Hat!" di conductor seh to familiar faces. “Some weather!... Hot!... Hot!... Hot!... Is it hot enough fi yuh? Is it hot? Is it... ?”</p>
<p>Mi commutation ticket come back to mi wid a dark stain fram him han. Dat anybody shuda care inna dis heat whose flushed lips him kiss, whose head mek damp di pajama pocket ova him heart!</p>
<p>… Thru di hall a di Buchanans's house did a blow a faint wind, carrying di sound a di telephone bell out to Gatsby an mi as wi did a wait at di door.</p>
<p>“Di maasta body?” di butler roar inna di mouthpiece. “Mi sari, mada, bot wi kyaahn furnish it—it tuu hat fi toch dis nait!”</p>
<p>Weh him really seh was: “Yes… Yes… mi wi si.”</p>
<p>Im set dung di receiver an come toward wi, glistening slightly, fi tek wi stiff straw hats.</p>
<p>“Madame expect yuh inna di salon!” him cry, needlessly indicating di direction. Inna dis heat every extra gesture was an affront to di common store a life.</p>
<p>Di room, shadowed well wid awnings, did dark an cool. Daisy an Jordan did a lay pan a enormous couch, like silver idols weigh dung dem own white dresses against di singing breeze a di fans.</p>
<p>“Wi kyaahn muuv,” dem se tugeda.</p>
<p>Jordan's fingers, powdered white ova dem tan, rest fi a moment inna mine.</p>
<p>“An Mr. Thomas Buchanan, di athlete?” Mi aks.</p>
<p>Siem taim mi ier im vais, gruff, muffled, husky, a di hall telephone.</p>
<p>Gatsby did a stan op inna di middle a di crimson carpet an did a look roun wid fascinated eyes. Daisy watch him an laugh, har sweet, exciting laugh; a likkle gust a powder rise fram har bosom inna di air.</p>
<p>“Di rumor is,” Jordan whispered, “dat dat a Tom's girl pan di telephone.”</p>
<p>Wi did silent. Di voice inna di hall rise high wid annoyance: “Very well, den, mi naa go sell yuh di car at all… Mi nuh unda no obligations to yuh at all… an as fi yuh bother mi bout it at lunch time, mi naa go stan dat at all!”</p>
<p>“Holding dung di receiver,” seh Daisy cynically.</p>
<p>“No, him nuh deh,” mi assure har. “A bona-fide deal. Mi happen fi know bout it.”</p>
<p>Tom fling open di door, block out it space fi a moment wid him thick body, an hurry inna di room.</p>
<p>“Mr. Gatsby!” Im put out im broad, flat han wid well-concealed dislike. “Mi glad fi si yuh, sa… Nick…”</p>
<p>“Mek wi a cold drink,” Daisy baal out.</p>
<p>As him lef di room again she get up an go ova to Gatsby an pull him face dung, kiss him pan di mout.</p>
<p>“Yuh know mi love yuh,” she murmured.</p>
<p>“Yuh forget seh a one lady deh deh,” seh Jordan.</p>
<p>Daisy look roun doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Yuh kiss Nick too.”</p>
<p>“Weh a low, vulgar girl!”</p>
<p>“Mi nuh care!” Daisy baal out, an staat clog pan di brick fireplace. Den shi memba di heat an sidong guilty pan di couch jos az a freshly laundered nurse weh did a lead a likkle gyal did a come inna di room.</p>
<p>“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out har arms. “Kom tu yuh own mada weh lov yuh.”</p>
<p>Di pikni, weh di nurse did lef, rush across di room an root shyly inna har mada dress.</p>
<p>“Di bles-sed pre-cious! Did mada get powder pan yuh ole yellowy hair? Stan up now, an seh—How-de-do.”</p>
<p>Gatsby an mi in turn lean dung an tek di likkle reluctant han. Aftawod im kip aan a luk pan di pikni wid sopraiz. Mi no tink him did eva really believe inna it existence before.</p>
<p>“Mi get dress before luncheon,” di pikni seh, an turn eagerly to Daisy.</p>
<p>“A chruu yu mada did waahn shuo yu aaf.” Har face ben inna di single wrinkle a di likkle white neck. “Yuh dream, yuh. Yuh absolute likkle dream.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” di pikni admit calmly. “Anti Jordan get aan wait jres tu.”</p>
<p>“How yuh like mada fren dem?” Daisy turn har roun so dat she face Gatsby. “Yuh tink dem priti?”</p>
<p>“Weh Daddy deh?”</p>
<p>“She nuh look like har fadda,” Daisy explain. “She look like mi. Shi have mi hair an shape a di face.”</p>
<p>Daisy sidong bak pan di sofa. Di nurse tek a step forward an hold out har han.</p>
<p>“Come, Pammy.”</p>
<p>“Goodbye, sweetheart!”</p>
<p>Wid a reluctant backward glance di well-disciplined pikni hold to har nurse's han an dem pull out di door, jus as Tom come back, preceding four gin rickeys weh click full a ice.</p>
<p>Gatsby tek up him drink.</p>
<p>“Dem certainly look cool,” him seh, wid visible tension.</p>
<p>Wi did a drink inna long, greedy swallows.</p>
<p>“Mi read somwe seh di sun a get hotter every year,” Tom seh genially. “It look like seh pretty soon di earth a go fall inna di sun—or wait a minute—a jus di opposite—di sun a get colder every year.</p>
<p>“Kom outsaid,” im se tu Gatsby, “mi wuda laik yu fi tek a luk pan di plies.”</p>
<p>Mi go wid dem out to di veranda. Pan di green Sound, stagnant inna di heat, one likkle sail crawl slowly toward di fresher sea. Gatsby's eyes did a follow it momentarily; him raise him han an point across di bay.</p>
<p>“Mi deh right across fram yuh.”</p>
<p>“So yuh deh.”</p>
<p>Wi eyes lift ova di rose-beds an di hot lawn an di weedy refuse a di dog-days alongshore. Slowly di white wings a di boat move against di blue cool limit a di sky. Ahead did deh di scalloped ocean an di abunding blessed isles.</p>
<p>“Sport deh fi yuh,” Tom seh, a nod. “Mi woulda like fi deh out deh wid him fi bout an hour.”</p>
<p>Wi did have luncheon inna di dining-room, darkened too against di heat, an drink dung nervous gaiety wid di cold ale.</p>
<p>“Weh wi ago do wid wiself dis aftanuun?” Daisy baal out, “an di die afta dat, an di neks toti ier?”</p>
<p>“No bada morbid,” Jordan seh. “Life staat all ova again wen it get crisp inna di fall.”</p>
<p>“Bot it so hat,” Daisy insis, pan di ej a baal, “an evriting so kanfyuuz. Mek wi aal go a toun!”</p>
<p>Har voice struggle on thru di heat, beating against it, molding it senselessness into forms.</p>
<p>“Mi eva ier se dem a mek a gyaabij outa a stabl,” Tom did a se tu Gatsby, “bot mi a di fos man we eva mek a stabl outa a gyaabij.”</p>
<p>“A who waan go a town?” Daisy demand insistently. Gatsby's eyes did a float toward har. “Ah,” she baal out, “yuh look so cool.”</p>
<p>Dem yai dem miit, an dem luk tugeda pan dem wan aneda, dem wan ina di spies. Wid an effort she glance dung pan di table.</p>
<p>“Yuh always look so cool,” she repeated.</p>
<p>Shi did tell him seh she love him, an Tom Buchanan did si. Im did shak. Him mout open likkle, an him look pan Gatsby, an den back pan Daisy as if him did jus recognize har as somebody him did know a long time ago.</p>
<p>“Yuh resemble di advertisement a di man,” she goh on innocently. “Yuh know di advertisement a di man—”</p>
<p>“Aal rait,” Tamas brok iin kwik-kwik, “Mi perfek wilin fi go a toun. Kom aan—wi aal a go a toun.”</p>
<p>Im get op, im yai dem stil a flash bitwiin Gatsby an im waif. Nobadi neva move.</p>
<p>"Cum aan!" Him temper crack likkle. “A wa di mata, eniou?Ef wi a go a toun, mek wi staat.”</p>
<p>Him han, weh did a tremble wid him effort fi self-control, did a bore to him lips di last a him glass a ale. Daisy vais mek wi tan op an out pan di blazing gravel drive.</p>
<p>“Wi jus a goh?” she object. “Laik dis? Wi naa go mek nobadi smok a sigaret fos?”</p>
<p>“Everybody smoke all through lunch.”</p>
<p>“Oh, mek wi have fun,” she beg him. “It too hot fi fuss.”</p>
<p>Im no ansa.</p>
<p>“Have it yuh own way,” she seh. “Come on, Jordan.”</p>
<p>Dem go opstairs fi get redi wail wi chrii man dem tan op de a shub di hat piis a piis wid wi fut dem. A silver curve a di moon did a hover already inna di western sky. Gatsby staat taak, change him mind, but not before Tom wheel an face him expectantly.</p>
<p>“Yuh have yuh stables yah?” aks Gatsby wid an effort.</p>
<p>“Bout a quarter a mile dung di road.”</p>
<p>"Awo."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>“Mi nuh see di idea fi go a town,” break out Tom savagely. “Women get dem notions inna dem head—”</p>
<p>“Wi fi tek anyting fi drink?” Daisy call fram one upper window.</p>
<p>“Mi wi get som wiska,” Tamas ansa. Im go inside.</p>
<p>Gatsby turn to mi rigidly:</p>
<p>“Mi cyan se nutten inna him yaad, uol spot.”</p>
<p>“She have a indiscreet voice,” mi remarked. “It full a—” Mi did a hesitate.</p>
<p>“Har voice full a money,” him seh suddenly.</p>
<p>Dat was it. Mi neva did andastan before. It did full a money—dat was di inexhaustible charm weh did a rose an fall inna it, di jingle a it, di cymbals dem song a it... High inna a white palace di king daughta, di golden girl...</p>
<p>Tom come outa di house a wrap a quart bottle inna a towel, an Daisy an Jordan a wear likkle tight hat a metallic cloth an a carry light capes ova dem arms.</p>
<p>“Wi fi go inna mi car?” Gatsby suggest. Im did feel di hot, green leather a di seat. “Mi shuda did lef it inna di shade.”</p>
<p>“A standard shift?” Tom demand.</p>
<p>"Yea."</p>
<p>“Well, yuh tek mi coupé an mek mi drive yuh car to town.”</p>
<p>Di suggestion did distasteful to Gatsby.</p>
<p>“Mi no tink seh nuff gas deh deh,” him object.</p>
<p>“Plenty a gas,” Tom seh boisterously. Im look pan di gauge. “An if it run out mi can stop a drugstore. Yuh can buy anyting a drugstore nowadays.”</p>
<p>A pause did a follow dis apparently pointless remark. Daisy look pon Tom frowning, an an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar an vaguely recognizable, as if mi did only hear it described in words, pass ova Gatsby's face.</p>
<p>“Come on, Daisy,” seh Tom, pressing har wid him han toward Gatsby's car. “Mi ago tek yuh inna dis circus wagon.”</p>
<p>Im open di door, but she move out fram di circle a im arm.</p>
<p>“Yuh tek Nick an Jordan. Wi ago fala yuh inna di coupé.”</p>
<p>Shi walk close to Gatsby, a touch him coat wid har han. Jordan an Tom an mi get inna di front seat a Gatsby's car, Tom push di unfamiliar gears dem tentatively, an wi shot off inna di oppressive heat, lef dem outa sight behind.</p>
<p>“Yuh si dat?” Tom demand.</p>
<p>“Yuh si weh?”</p>
<p>Im look pon mi keenly, an realize seh Jordan an mi mosi did know all along.</p>
<p>“Yu tingk mi priti dom, iihn?” him suggest. “Maitbi mi de, bot mi av a—aalmuos a sekan sait, somtaim, we tel mi we fi du. Miebi yu no biliiv dat, bot saiyans—”</p>
<p>Im pause. Di immediate contingency tek him, pull him back fram di edge a theoretical abyss.</p>
<p>“Mi mek a likkle investigation a dis fellow,” him continue. “Mi coulda did go deeper if mi did know—”</p>
<p>“Yuh mean yuh been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.</p>
<p>"Wah?" Confused, him stare at wi as wi did a laugh. “A medium?”</p>
<p>“About Gatsby.”</p>
<p>“Bout Gatsby! No, mi neva. Mi seh mi did a mek a likkle investigation a him past.”</p>
<p>“An yuh find out seh him a one Oxford man,” Jordan seh helpfully.</p>
<p>“An Oxford man!” Im did incredulous. “Like hell him is! Him wear a pink suit.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless him a one Oxford man.”</p>
<p>“Oxford, New Mexico,” Tom snort contemptuously, “or someting like dat.”</p>
<p>“Lisn, Tom. If yuh such a snob, why yuh invite him fi lunch?” Jordan demand crossly.</p>
<p>“Daisy did invite him; she did know him before wi did married—God know weh!”</p>
<p>Wi did all irritable now wid di fading ale, an aware a it wi drive fi a while inna silence. Den as Doctor TJ Eckleburg's faded eyes come in sight dung di road, mi memba Gatsby's caution bout gasoline.</p>
<p>“Wi have enough fi get wi to town,” Tom seh.</p>
<p>“But a garage deh yah,” Jordan objected. “Mi nuh waan get stall inna dis baking heat.”</p>
<p>Tom throw on both brakes impatiently, an we slid to an abrupt dusty stop unda Wilson's sign. Afta a moment di proprietor come outa di interior a him establishment an gaze hollow-eyed at di car.</p>
<p>“Mek wi tek som gyas!” Tom baal out roughly. “Weh yuh tink wi did stop fa—fi admire di view?”</p>
<p>“Mi sik,” Wilson se widout muuv. “Mi did sick all day.”</p>
<p>“Weh di mata?”</p>
<p>“Mi all run dung.”</p>
<p>“Well, mi fi help miself?” Tom demand. “Yuh sound well enough pan di phone.”</p>
<p>Wid an effort Wilson lef di shade an support a di doorway an, breathing hard, unscrewed di cap a di tank. Inna di sunlight him face did green.</p>
<p>“Mi neva mean fi interrupt yuh lunch,” him seh. “But mi need money pretty bad, an mi did a wanda weh yuh did a go do wid yuh ole car.”</p>
<p>“How yuh like dis one?” Tom aks. “Mi buy it last week.”</p>
<p>“A wan nice yellow one,” Wilson seh, as him strain pan di handle.</p>
<p>“Like fi buy it?”</p>
<p>“Big chance,” Wilson smile faintly. “No, but mi coulda mek some money pan di ada.”</p>
<p>“Weh yuh waan money fah, all af a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Mi deh yah too lang. Mi waan get weh. Mi an mi waif waan go West.”</p>
<p>“Yuh wife do,” Tom exclaimed, startled.</p>
<p>“Shi a taak bout it fi ten ier.” Im res fi a moment gens di pump, a shade im yai dem. “An nou shi a go weda shi waahn ar nat. Mi a go get ar we.”</p>
<p>Di coupé flash by wi wid a flurry a dust an di flash a one waving han.</p>
<p>“Weh mi owe yuh?” Tom demand harshly.</p>
<p>“Mi jus get wised up to someting funny di last two days,” Wilson remarked. “A dat mek mi waahn get we. A dat mek mi a bada yu bout di kyaar.”</p>
<p>“Weh mi owe yuh?”</p>
<p>“Dollar twenty.”</p>
<p>Di relentless beating heat did a staat confuse mi an mi did have a bad moment deh before mi realize seh so far him suspicion dem neva did alight pan Tom. Him did discover seh Myrtle did have some sort a life apart fram him inna anodda world, an di shock did mek him physically sick. Mi stare at him an den at Tom, who did mek a parallel discovery less dan an hour before—an it come to mi seh no difference neva deh between man, inna intelligence or race, so profound as di difference between di sick an di well. Wilson did so sick dat him look guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if him did jus get some poor girl wid pickney.</p>
<p>“Mi wi mek yuh have dat deh car,” Tom seh. “Mi wi sen it uova tumaro aftanuun.”</p>
<p>Dat deh locality was always vaguely disquieting, even inna di broad glare a afternoon, an now mi turn mi head as if mi did get warn a someting behind. Ova di ash-heaps di giant eyes a Doctor TJ Eckleburg did a keep dem vigil, but mi did si, afta a moment, seh ada eyes did a regard wi wid peculiar intensity fram less dan twenty feet away.</p>
<p>Inna one a di windows dem ova di garage di curtains dem did move aside likkle, an Myrtle Wilson did a peer dung pan di car. So engrossed was she dat she neva have no consciousness of being observed, an one emotion afta anodda crept inna har face like objects inna a slowly developing picture. Har expression did curiously familiar—it was an expression mi did often see pan women's face, but pan Myrtle Wilson's face it did look purposeless an inexplicable until mi realize seh har eyes, wide wid jealous terror, did fix not pan Tom, but pan Jordan Baker, whom she did tek fi be him wife.</p>
<hr/>
<p>No confusion nuh deh like di confusion a one simple mind, an as wi did a drive weh Tom did a feel di hot whips a panic. Him wife an him mistress, until one hour ago secure an inviolate, did a slip precipitately fram him control. Instinct mek him step pan di accelerator wid di double purpose fi overtake Daisy an lef Wilson behind, an wi sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, mongst di spidery girders a di elevated, wi come inna di sight a di easygoing blue coupé.</p>
<p>“Dem big movies deh roun Fiftieth Street cool,” Jordan suggest. “Mi love New York pan summer afternoons wen everybody deh weh. Somting very sensuous bout it—overripe, as if all sorts a funny fruits did a go fall inna yuh han dem.”</p>
<p>Di wod “sensuous” did have di effect a further disquieting Tom, but before him coulda invent a protest di coupé did come to a stop, an Daisy signal wi fi draw up alongside.</p>
<p>“We wi a go?” shi baal out.</p>
<p>“How bout di movies?”</p>
<p>“It so hat,” shi komplien. “Yuh go. Wi ago ride roun an meet yuh afta.” Wid an effort har wit rise faintly. “Wi a go miit yu pan som kaana. Mi a go bi di man we a sumuok tuu sigaret.”</p>
<p>“Wi cyan argue bout it yah,” Tom seh impatiently, as a truck gi out a cursing whistle behind wi. “Yuh follow mi to di south side a Central Park, inna front a di Plaza.”</p>
<p>Several times him turn him head an look back fi dem car, an if di traffic did a delay dem him slow up until dem come inna sight. Mi tink him did fraid dem woulda dart dung a side-street an out a him life fi eva.</p>
<p>Bot dem neva du dat. An wi all tek di less explicable step fi engage di parlor a one suite inna di Plaza Hotel.</p>
<p>Di prolonged an tumultuous argument weh did end by herding wi inna dat deh room eludes mi, though mi have a sharp physical memory dat, inna di course a it, mi underwear did a keep climbing like a damp snake roun mi legs an intermittent beads a sweat did a race cool across mi back. Di notion staat wid Daisy's suggestion seh wi hire five bathrooms an tek cold baths, an den assume more tangible form as “a place fi have a mint julep.” Each a wi seh ova an ova seh a did a “crazy idea”—we all talk at once to a baffled clerk an tink, or pretend fi tink, seh wi did a be very funny...</p>
<p>Di room did big an stifling, an, though it did already four o'clock, opening di windows admit only a gust a hot shrubbery fram di Park. Daisy go a di mirror an stan op wid har back to wi, a fix har hair.</p>
<p>“A swell suite,” Jordan whispered respectfully, an everybody laugh.</p>
<p>“Open anodda window,” Daisy seh, widout ton roun.</p>
<p>“Nobadi nuh deh deh more.”</p>
<p>“Well, wi woulda beta telephone fi an axe—”</p>
<p>“Di ting fi do is fi forget bout di heat,” Tom seh impatiently. “Yuh mek it ten times worse by crab bout it.”</p>
<p>Im tek out di bakl a wiska fram di towil an put it pan di tiebl.</p>
<p>“Why nuh mek har alone, old sport?” Gatsby remarked. “A yuh did waan come a town.”</p>
<p>A did a moment a silence. Di telephone book slip fram it nail an splash to di floor, weh Jordan whisper, “Excuse me”—but dis time nobadi neva laugh.</p>
<p>“Mi wi pick it up,” mi offer.</p>
<p>“Mi get it.” Gatsby examine di string weh did part, an mutter “Hum!” inna an interested way, an toss di book pan a chair.</p>
<p>“Dat a one great expression a yuh, noh true?” Tom seh sharply.</p>
<p>"A wah?"</p>
<p>“All dis 'old sport' business. Weh yuh pick dat up?”</p>
<p>“Nou si ya, Tom,” Daisy se, a ton roun fram di miira, “ef yu a go mek porsnal rimark mi naa go tan ya a minit. Kaal op an aada som ais fi di mint julep.”</p>
<p>As Tom tek op di receiver di compressed heat explode inna sound an we did a listen to di portentous chords a Mendelssohn's Wedding March fram di ballroom dung deh.</p>
<p>“Imagine married anybody inna dis heat!” Jordan baal out dismally.</p>
<p>“Still—mi did married inna di middle a June,” Daisy memba. “Louisville inna June! Somebody did a faint. A who did a faint, Tom?”</p>
<p>“Biloxi,” him ansa shortly.</p>
<p>“A man name Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, an him mek boxes—dat a one fact—an him did fram Biloxi, Tennessee.”</p>
<p>“Dem carry him inna mi yaad,” Jordan added, “cause wi did live jus two doors fram di church. An him did stay three weeks, until Daddy tell him seh him haffi get out. Di day afta him lef Daddy dead.” Afta a moment she added as if she mighta did sound irreverent, “There wasn't any connection.”</p>
<p>“Mi used to know a Bill Biloxi fram Memphis,” mi remarked.</p>
<p>“Dat was him cousin. Mi did know him whole family history before him lef. Him gi mi a aluminum putter weh mi use today.”</p>
<p>Di music did dead dung as di ceremony staat an now a long cheer did a float inna di window, followed by intermittent cries a “Yea—ea—ea!” an finally by a burst a jazz as di dancing staat.</p>
<p>“Wi a get uol,” Daisy se. “If wi did young wi woulda rise an dance.”</p>
<p>“Memba Biloxi,” Jordan warn har. “Weh yuh did know him, Tom?”</p>
<p>“Biloxi?” Im concentrate wid an effort. “Mi neva know him. Him was a fren a Daisy.”</p>
<p>“Im neva deh,” she deny. “Mi neva si im bifuor. Im kom dong inna di praivit kyaar.”</p>
<p>“Well, him seh him know yuh. Im seh him grow inna Louisville. Asa Bird bring him roun at di last minute an ask if wi have room fi him.”</p>
<p>Jordan did a smile.</p>
<p>“Im did probably a bumming him way home. Im tell mi seh him a president a yuh class at Yale.”</p>
<p>Tom an mi look pan each ada blankly.</p>
<p>“Bil <i>oxi</i> ?”</p>
<p>“First place, wi neva have no president—”</p>
<p>Gatsby foot beat a short, restless tattoo an Tom look pan him suddenly.</p>
<p>“By di way, Mr. Gatsby, mi andastan yuh a one Oxford man.”</p>
<p>“Not exactly.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, mi andastan yuh go a Oxford.”</p>
<p>“Yes—mi go deh.”</p>
<p>A pause. Den Tom's voice, incredulous an insulting:</p>
<p>“Yuh mus did go deh bout di time Biloxi did go a New Haven.”</p>
<p>Wan neda pause. A waiter knock an come in wid crushed mint an ice but di silence neva break by him “tank yuh” an di soft closing a di door. Dis tremendous detail was fi be clear up at last.</p>
<p>“Mi tell yuh seh mi go deh,” Gatsby seh.</p>
<p>“Mi hear yuh, but mi woulda like fi know wen.”</p>
<p>“A did inna nineteen-nineteen, mi only stay five months. A dat mek mi cyan really call miself an Oxford man.”</p>
<p>Tom look roun fi si if wi did a mirror him unbelief. But wi did a look pon Gatsby.</p>
<p>“A did a opportunity dem did gi some a di officers dem afta di armistice,” him continued. “Wi coulda go a any a di universities dem inna England or France.”</p>
<p>Mi did waan get up an slap him pan di back. Mi did have one a dem renewals a complete faith inna him weh mi did experience before.</p>
<p>Daisy get op, a smile likl bit, an go a di tiebl.</p>
<p>“Uopn di wiska, Tom,” shi aada, “an mi wi mek yu wahn mint julep. Den yu naa go luk so stupid tu yuself… Luk pan di mint!”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” Tom snapped, “Mi waan ask Mr. Gatsby one more kweschan.”</p>
<p>“Go on,” Gatsby seh politely.</p>
<p>“Weh kain a row yuh a try cause inna mi house anyhow?”</p>
<p>Dem did out inna di open at last an Gatsby did content.</p>
<p>“Im naa cause no row,” Daisy look desperately fram one to di ada. “Yuh a cause a row. Please have a likkle self-control.”</p>
<p>“Self-control!” Tom repeated incredulously. “Mi suppose di latest ting is fi sit back an mek Mr. Nobody fram Nowhere mek love to yuh wife. Well, if dat a di idea yuh can count mi out... Nowadays people staat by sneering at family life an family institutions, an next dem ago throw everyting ovaboard an have intermarriage between black an white.”</p>
<p>Flushed wid him impassioned gibberish, him si himself a stan op alone pan di laas barrier a civilization.</p>
<p>“Wi all white yah,” Jordan murmured.</p>
<p>“Mi nuo se mi no tuu papila. Mi no gi no big paati. Mi tingk se yu afi mek yu ous ton wan pigsty fi av no fren—ina di madan worl.”</p>
<p>Angry as mi did, as we all did, mi did tempted fi laugh whenever him open him mout. Di transition fram libertine to prig did so complete.</p>
<p>“Mi have someting fi tell <i>yuh</i> , old sport—” staat Gatsby. But Daisy did guess at him intention.</p>
<p>“Please don't!” she interrupt helplessly. “Pliiz mek di uol a wi go a yaad. Wa mek di uol a wi no go a yaad?”</p>
<p>“A gud aidiya dat,” mi get op. “Come on, Tom. Nobody waan a drink.”</p>
<p>“Mi waan know weh Mr. Gatsby have fi tell mi.”</p>
<p>“Yu waif no lov yu,” Gatsby se. “Shi neva lov yu. Shi lov mi.”</p>
<p>“Yuh mus be crazy!” Tom baal out automatically.</p>
<p>Gatsby sprang to him foot, vivid wid excitement.</p>
<p>“She neva love yuh, yuh hear?” im baal out. “Shi onggl marid yu kaaz mi did puor an shi did taiyad a wiet pan mi. A did wan torbl mistiek, bot iina ar aat shi neva lov nobadi eksep mi!”</p>
<p>At dis point Jordan an mi try fi go, but Tom an Gatsby insist wid competitive firmness seh wi remain—as if none a dem neva have nutten fi conceal an it woulda be a privilege fi tek paat vicariously a dem emotions.</p>
<p>“Sidong, Daisy,” Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully fi di paternal note. “Weh a gwaan?Mi waan hear all bout it.”</p>
<p>“Mi tell yuh weh a gwaan,” Gatsby seh. “Going on fi five years—an yuh neva know.”</p>
<p>Tom turn to Daisy sharply.</p>
<p>“Yuh a si dis fellow fi five years?”</p>
<p>“Not seeing,” seh Gatsby. “No, wi couldn't meet. But both a wi did love each other all dat time, ole sport, an yuh neva know. Mi used to laugh sometimes”—but neva did a laugh inna him eyes—“fi tink seh yuh neva know.”</p>
<p>“Oh—dat a all.” Tom tap him thick finga dem tugeda like a clergyman an lean back inna him chair.</p>
<p>“Yuh crazy!” him explode. “Mi kyaahn taak bout wa apm faiv ier ago, kaa mi neva nuo Daisy den—an mi ago get damn ef mi si ou yu get widin a mail a ar ef yu no bring di grojri dem tu di bak duo. Bot aal di res a dat a Gad damn lai. Daisy did lov mi wen shi marid mi an shi lov mi nou.”</p>
<p>“No,” Gatsby seh, a shake him head.</p>
<p>“She do, though. Di trouble is dat sometimes she get foolish ideas inna har head an nuh know weh she a duh.” Im nod sagely. “An weh more, mi love Daisy too. Once in a while mi go off pan a spree an mek a fool a miself, but mi always come back, an inna mi heart mi love har all di time.”</p>
<p>“Yuh a revolt,” Daisy seh. Shi ton tu mi, an ar vais, we did a jrap wan oktav luowa, ful op di ruum wid chrilin skorn: “Yu nuo wa mek wi lef Chicago? Mi sopraiz se dem neva chriit yu laik di stuori bout dat de likl spree.”</p>
<p>Gatsby walk ova an stan up beside har.</p>
<p>“Daisy, dat a all ova now,” him seh earnestly. “It no mata no muor. Jos tel im di chuut — se yu neva lov im — an aal a it wip out fi eva.”</p>
<p>Shi look pan him blindly. “Why—how mi coulda love him—possibly?”</p>
<p>“Yuh neva love him.”</p>
<p>Shi did a hesitate. Har eyes dem fall pan Jordan an mi wid a sort a appeal, as if she realize at last weh she did a duh—an as if she neva, all along, intended fi do nutten at all. But it did done now. It did too late.</p>
<p>“Mi neva lov him,” she seh, wid perceptible reluctance.</p>
<p>“Not at Kapiolani?” Tom demand suddenly.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Fram di ballroom unda, muffled an suffocating chords did a drif up pan hot waves a air.</p>
<p>“Not dat day deh mi carry yuh dung fram di Punch Bowl fi keep yuh shoes dry?” A did a husky tenderness inna him tone... “Daisy?”</p>
<p>“Please don't do.” Har voice did cold, but di rancor did gaan fram it. Shi look pon Gatsby. “De so, Jay,” shi seh—but har han as shi did a try light a cigarette did a tremble. Suddenly she fling di cigarette an di burning match pan di carpet.</p>
<p>“Oh, yuh waan too much!” shi baal out tu Gatsby. “Mi lov yu nou—dat no inof? Mi kyaahn elp we paas.” Shi staat sob helplessly. “Mi did lov him once—but mi did lov yuh tu.”</p>
<p>Gatsby yai dem uopm an lak.</p>
<p>“Yuh did love mi <i>too</i> ?” him repeat.</p>
<p>“Even dat a lie,” Tom seh savagely. “She neva know seh yuh did alive. Why—dem deh tings between Daisy an mi weh yuh nah go know, tings weh none a wi cyaan eva forget.”</p>
<p>Di wod dem did look like dem did a bite Gatsby physically.</p>
<p>“Mi waan taak to Daisy alone,” him insist. “She all excited now—”</p>
<p>“Even alone mi cyan seh mi neva love Tom,” she admit inna a pitiful voice. “It wouldn't be true.”</p>
<p>“Af course it wouldn't,” Tom agree.</p>
<p>Shi ton tu har ozban.</p>
<p>“As if it did matta to yuh,” she seh.</p>
<p>“Af kour it mata. Mi a go tek beta kier a yu fram nou aan.”</p>
<p>“Yuh nuh andastan,” Gatsby seh, wid a touch a panic. “Yuh naa go tek kier a har no more.”</p>
<p>“Mi no?” Tom open him eyes wide an laugh. Him coulda afford fi control himself now. “Wa mek dat?”</p>
<p>“Daisy a lef yuh.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Mi deh, though,” she seh wid a visible effort.</p>
<p>“She naa lef mi!” Tom's words suddenly lean dung ova Gatsby. “Certainly not fi a common swindler weh woulda haffi steal di ring weh him put pan har finga.”</p>
<p>“Mi naa go stan dis!” Daisy baal out. “Oh, please mek wi get out.”</p>
<p>“A who yuh is, anyhow?” break out Tom. “Yuh a one a dem bunch weh a hang roun wid Meyer Wolfshiem—dat much mi happen fi know. Mi mek a likkle investigation inna yuh affairs—an mi ago carry it further tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yuh can suit yuhself bout dat, old sport,” seh Gatsby steadily.</p>
<p>“Mi find out weh yuh 'drugstores' dem was.” Im ton tu wi an taak faas. “Im an dis Wolfshiem buy up a lot a side-street drugstores yah an inna Chicago an sell grain alcohol ova di counter. Dat a one a him likkle stunts. Mi pick him fi a bootlegger di first time mi si him, an mi neva far wrong.”</p>
<p>“Weh bout it?” Gatsby seh politely. “Mi guess yuh fren Walter Chase neva too proud fi come in pan it.”</p>
<p>“An yuh lef him inna di lurch, noh true? Yuh mek him go a jail fi a month ova inna New Jersey. God! Yuh shuda hear Walter pan di subject a <i>yuh</i> .”</p>
<p>“Im come to wi dead broke. Im did very glad fi pick up some money, old sport.”</p>
<p>“Yuh no call mi 'old sport'!” Tom baal out. Gatsby neva seh notn. “Walter coulda have yuh up pan di betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scare him fi shet him mout.”</p>
<p>Dat deh unfamiliar yet recognizable look did deh back again inna Gatsby's face.</p>
<p>“Dat deh drugstore business was jus likkle change,” Tom continued slowly, “but yuh have someting pan yuh now weh Walter fraid fi tell mi bout.”</p>
<p>Mi glance at Daisy, who did a stare terrified between Gatsby an har husband, an at Jordan, who did staat balance an invisible but absorbing object pan di tip a har chin. Den mi turn back to Gatsby—an mi did frack at him expression. Im look—an dis is said in all contempt fi di babbled slander a im garden—as if im did “kill a man.” Fi a moment di set a him face coulda be described inna jus dat deh fantastic way.</p>
<p>It pass, an him staat talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everyting, defending him name against accusations weh neva mek. But wid every word she did a draw further an further inna harself, so him give dat up, an only di dead dream did a fight on as di aftanuun did a slip weh, a try touch weh neva tangible no more, a struggle unhappily, undespairingly, toward dat deh lost voice across di room.</p>
<p>Di voice beg again fi go.</p>
<p>“ <i>Please</i> , Tom! Mi cyan stan dis no more.”</p>
<p>Har frightened eyes tell seh whatever intentions, whatever courage she did have, did definitely gone.</p>
<p>“Unu two staat pan yaad, Daisy,” Tom seh. “Inna Mr. Gatsby car.”</p>
<p>Shi look pon Tom, alarmed now, but him insist wid magnanimous scorn.</p>
<p>“Go on. Him naa go annoy yuh. Mi tink him realize seh him presumptuous likkle flirtation don.”</p>
<p>Dem did gaan, widout a wod, snap out, mek accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even fram wi pity.</p>
<p>Afta a moment Tom get up an staat wrap di unoopn bottle a whiskey inna di towel.</p>
<p>“Yuh waan any a dis stuff? Jordan?… Nick?”</p>
<p>Mi neva ansa.</p>
<p>“Nick?” Im aks agen.</p>
<p>"Wah?"</p>
<p>“Yuh waan any?”</p>
<p>“No… mi jus memba seh today a mi birthday.”</p>
<p>Mi was thirty. Before mi stretch di portentous, menacing road a one new decade.</p>
<p>A did sevn aklak wen wi get inna di kuop wid im an staat fi Lang Ailan. Tom did a taak incessantly, exulting an laughing, but him voice did as remote fram Jordan an mi as di foreign clamor pan di sidewalk or di tumult a di elevated overhead. Human sympathy have its limits, an we did content fi mek all dem tragic arguments fade wid di city lights behind. Thirty—di promise a one decade a loneliness, a thinning list a single man fi know, a thinning briefcase a enthusiasm, thinning hair. But deh did have Jordan beside mi, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever fi carry well-forgotten dreams fram age to age. As we did a pass ova di dark bridge har wan face did a fall lazily against mi coat's shoulder an di formidable stroke a thirty dead weh wid di reassuring pressure a har han.</p>
<p>So wi drive on toward death thru di cooling twilight.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Di young Greek, Michaelis, weh did a run di coffee joint beside di ash-heaps was di principal witness at di inquest. Him did sleep thru di heat until afta five, wen him stroll ova to di garage, an find George Wilson sick inna him office—really sick, pale as him own pale hair an a shake all ova. Michaelis advise him fi go a bed, but Wilson neva waan, an seh him woulda miss a lot a business if him did. While him neighbor did a try fi persuade him a violent racket break out ovahead.</p>
<p>“Mi have mi wife lock in up deh,” Wilson explain calmly. “Shi a go tan de til di die afta tumaro, an den wi a go muuv we.”</p>
<p>Michaelis did astonized; dem did a nieba fi four years, an Wilson neva did look faintly capable fi such a statement. Generally him was one a dem worn-out man deh: wen him neva did a work, him did sidong pan a chair inna di doorway an did a stare at di people an di cars dem weh did a pass along di road. Wen anybody did a taak to him him invariably laugh inna an agreeable, colorless way. Im a did im waif man an no fi im uona.</p>
<p>So naturally Michaelis did a try fi find out weh did happen, but Wilson neva did a seh a word—instead him staat throw curious, suspicious glances pan him visitor an ask him weh him did a do at certain times pan certain days. Jus as di latter did a get uneasy, some workman come past di door bound fi him restaurant, an Michaelis tek di opportunity fi get weh, intend fi come back later. Bot im neva du dat. Im suppose im figet to, dat a all. Wen him come outside again, a likkle afta seven, him did memba di conversation cause him did hear Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud an scolding, dungstairs inna di garage.</p>
<p>“Beat mi!” him hear har cry. “Fling mi dong an biit mi, yu doti likl kowad!”</p>
<p>A moment later she rush out inna di dusk, a wave har han dem an a shout—before him coulda move fram him door di business did ova.</p>
<p>Di “death car” as di newspapers did call it, neva stop; it come outa di gathering darkness, waver tragically fi a moment, an den disappear roun di next bend. Mavro Michaelis neva even sure a it colour—im tell di first policeman seh it was light green. Di ada car, di one weh did a goh toward New York, come fi rest a hundred yards beyond, an di driver hurry back to weh Myrtle Wilson, har life violently extinguished, kneel inna di road an mixle har thick dark blood wid di dust.</p>
<p>Michaelis an dis man reach har fos, but wen dem did torn open har shirtwaist, weh did still damp wid perspiration, dem si seh har left breast did a swing loose like a flap, an dem neva need fi listen fi di heart unda it. Di mout did wide open an rip likkle at di corners, as if she did choke likkle inna giving up di tremendous vitality weh she did store so long.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Wi si di three or four automobiles an di crowd wen wi did still deh some distance away.</p>
<p>“Wreck!” Tom seh. “Dat gud. Wilson ago av a likl bizniz at laas.”</p>
<p>Im slow dung, but still widout any intention fi stop, until, as we did come nearer, di hushed, intent faces a di people dem at di garage door mek im automatically put on di brakes.</p>
<p>“Wi a go tek a look,” him seh doubtfully, “jus a look.”</p>
<p>Mi became aware now a one hollow, wailing sound weh did a issue incessantly fram di garage, a sound weh as wi get outa di coupé an walk toward di door resolve itself inna di words “Oh, my God!” uttered ova an ova inna a gasping moan.</p>
<p>“A some bad trouble yah,” Tom seh excitedly.</p>
<p>Im reach up pan tiptoes an peer ova a circle a heads inna di garage, weh did lit only by a yellow light inna a swinging metal basket ovahead. Den him mek a harsh sound inna him throat, an wid a violent thrusting movement a him powerful arms push him way through.</p>
<p>Di circle close up again wid a running murmur a expostulation; it was a minute before mi coulda see anyting at all. Den new arrivals deranged di line, an Jordan an mi get push suddenly inside.</p>
<p>Myrtle Wilson's body, wrap inna a blanket, an den inna anodda blanket, as if she did a suffer fram a chill inna di hot night, did a lay pan a worktable by di wall, an Tom, wid him back to wi, did a bend ova it, motionless. Next to him did a stan op a motorcycle policeman a tek dung names wid much sweat an correction inna a likkle book. At first mi couldn't find di source a di high, groaning words weh did a echo clamorously thru di bare garage—den mi si Wilson a stan up pan di raised threshold a him office, a sway back an forth an a hold to di doorposts wid both han dem. Some man did a talk to him inna a low voice an a try, fram time to time, fi put a han pan him shoulda, but Wilson neva hear nor see. Him eyes woulda drop slowly fram di swinging light to di laden table by di wall, an den jerk back to di light again, an him gi out incessantly him high, horrible call:</p>
<p>“Oh, mi Ga-od! Oh, mi Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, mi Ga-od!”</p>
<p>Presently Tom lift him head wid a jerk an, afta him stare roun di garage wid glazed eyes, address a mumbled incoherent remark to di policeman.</p>
<p>“ <i>M</i> - <i>a</i> - <i>v</i> —” di policeman did a seh, “— <i>o</i> —”</p>
<p>“No, <i>r</i> —” corrected di man, “ <i>M</i> - <i>a</i> - <i>v</i> - <i>r</i> - <i>o</i> —”</p>
<p>“Lisn tu mi!” Tom mutter fiercely.</p>
<p>“ <i>r</i> —” di policeman seh, “ <i>o</i> —”</p>
<p>“ <i>g</i> —”</p>
<p>“ <i>g</i> —” Im look up as Tom's broad han fall sharply pan im shoulda. “Weh yuh waan, fella?”</p>
<p>“Weh happen?—dat a weh mi waan know.”</p>
<p>“Auto hit har. Ins'antly kill har.”</p>
<p>“Instantly killed,” Tom repeated, staring.</p>
<p>“She run out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch neva even stopus car.”</p>
<p>“A did two cars,” Michaelis seh, “one a come, one a go, yuh see?”</p>
<p>“Yuh a go weh?” di policeman aks keenly.</p>
<p>“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—im han rise toward di blankets but stop halfway an fall to him side—“she run out deh an di one weh did a come fram N’York knock right inna har, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”</p>
<p>“Weh di place a di place yah?” di officer demand.</p>
<p>“Hasn't have no name.”</p>
<p>A pale well-dressed negro step near.</p>
<p>“A did a yellow car,” him seh, “big yellow car. New.”</p>
<p>“Yuh si di accident?” di poliisman aks.</p>
<p>“No, but di car pass mi dung di road, going faster'n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”</p>
<p>“Kom yah mek wi tek yuh niem. Luk out nou. Mi waan get fi'im niem.”</p>
<p>Som wod a dis kanvasieshan mosi did riich Wilson, a swing inna di afis duor, fi suddenli wan nyuu tiim fain vais mongx im griep krai dem:</p>
<p>“Yu no afi tel mi wa kain-a kyaar it did bi! Mi nuo wa kain-a kyaar it did bi!”</p>
<p>Wen mi did a watch Tom, mi si di wad a muscle back a him shoulda a tighten unda him coat. Him walk quickly ova to Wilson an, stan up inna front a him, grab him firmly by di upper arms.</p>
<p>“Yuh haffi pull yuhself tugeda,” him seh wid soothing gruffness.</p>
<p>Wilson yai dem jrap pan Tom; him staat up pan him tiptoes an den woulda collapse to him knees if Tom neva hold him upright.</p>
<p>“Lisn,” Tom seh, a shake him likkle. “Mi jus reach yah a minute ago, fram New York. Mi did a bring yuh dat deh coupé weh we did a talk bout. Dat deh yellow car weh mi did a drive dis aftanoon neva fi mi—yuh hear? Mi neva see it all aftanuun.”</p>
<p>Only di negro an mi did deh near enough fi hear weh him seh, but di policeman ketch someting inna di tone an look ova wid truculent eyes.</p>
<p>“Weh all dat?” him demand.</p>
<p>“Mi a one a him fren.” Tom turn him head but keep him han dem firm pan Wilson body. “Im seh him know di car weh did do it... A did a yellow car.”</p>
<p>Some dim impulse move di policeman fi look suspiciously at Tom.</p>
<p>“An weh colour yuh car?”</p>
<p>“A one blue car, a coupé.”</p>
<p>“Wi come straight fram New York,” mi seh.</p>
<p>Sombadi weh did a drive likkle behind wi confirm dis, an di policeman turn weh.</p>
<p>“Now, if yuh wi mek mi have dat deh name again correct—”</p>
<p>Pick up Wilson like a doll, Tom carry him inna di office, set him dung inna a chair, an come back.</p>
<p>“If somebody come yah an sit wid him,” him snap authoritatively. Im watch while di two man dem weh did a stan op closest did a look at each other an go inna di room widout dem waan. Den Tom shut di door pan dem an come dung di single step, him eyes a avoid di table. As him did a pass close to mi him whisper: “Mek wi get out.”</p>
<p>Self-consciously, wid him authoritative arms breaking di way, wi push thru di still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who did sen fi inna wild hope half an hour ago.</p>
<p>Tom drive slowly until we did beyond di bend—den him foot come dung hard, an di coupé race along thru di night. Inna a likkle while mi hear a low husky sob, an si seh di tears did a overflow dung him face.</p>
<p>“Di God damned coward!” him whimpered. “Im neva iivn stap im kyaar.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Di Buchanans dem house did a float suddenly toward wi chruu di dark rustling trees. Tom stop beside di porch an look up pan di secan floor, weh two windows did a bloom wid light mongx di vines dem.</p>
<p>“Daisy a yaad,” im se. As we get outa di car him glance at mi an frown likkle.</p>
<p>“Mi shuda did drop yuh inna West Egg, Nick. Notn nuh deh weh wi can do tonight.”</p>
<p>A change did come ova him, an him did a talk gravely, an wid decision. As wi did a walk across di moonlight gravel to di porch him dispose a di situation inna a few brisk phrases.</p>
<p>“Mi ago telephone fi a taxi fi tek yuh home, an while yuh a wait yuh an Jordan beta go inna di kitchen an mek dem get yuh some supper—if yuh waan any.” Im uopn di duor. “Come in.”</p>
<p>“No, tangks. Bot mi wuda glad ef yu wuda aada mi di taksi. Mi wi wiet outsaid.”</p>
<p>Jordan put har han pan mi arm.</p>
<p>“Yuh naa come in, Nick?”</p>
<p>“No, tanks.”</p>
<p>Mi did a feel likkle sick an mi did waan be alone. But Jordan did a stay fi a moment more.</p>
<p>“A ongl aaf-paas nain,” shi se.</p>
<p>Mi woulda be damned if mi did go in; Mi did have enough a all a dem fi one day, an suddenly dat did include Jordan too. Shi mosi did si somting a dis inna mi expression, kaa shi ton weh abruptly an ron op di porch step dem inna di ous. Mi sidong fi kopl minit wid mi ed ina mi an dem, til mi ier di fuon tek op iinsaid an di butla vais a kaal taksi. Den mi walk slowly dung di drive weh fram di house, an mi did a go wait by di gate.</p>
<p>Mi neva gaan twenti yaad wen mi ier mi niem an Gatsbi step fram bitwiin tuu bush inna di ruod. Mi mosi did feel pretty weird by dat deh time, cause mi couldn't tink bout nutten except di luminosity a him pink suit unda di moon.</p>
<p>"Weh yah do?" Mi aks.</p>
<p>“Just standing yah, old sport.”</p>
<p>Somhow, dat did look like a despicable occupation. Fi all mi did know him did a go rob di house inna a moment; Mi wouldn't have been surprised fi see sinister faces, di faces a “Wolfshiem's people,” behind him inna di dark shrubbery.</p>
<p>“Yuh si any trouble pan di road?” him ask afta a minute.</p>
<p>"Yea."</p>
<p>Im did a hesitate.</p>
<p>“Dem did kill har?”</p>
<p>"Yea."</p>
<p>“Mi did tink so; mi tell Daisy seh mi did tink so. It beta dat di shock shuda all come at once. She did stan it pretty well.”</p>
<p>Im taak laik se Daisy riakshan a di onggl ting we mata.</p>
<p>“Mi reach West Egg by a side road,” him seh, “an lef di car inna mi garage. Mi nuh tink nobody did see wi, but a course mi cyaan be sure.”</p>
<p>Mi did dislike him so much by dis time dat mi neva find it necessary fi tell him seh him did wrong.</p>
<p>“A who was di woman?” him ask.</p>
<p>“Har name was Wilson. Har husband own di garage. How di devil did happen?”</p>
<p>“Well, mi try fi swing di wheel—” Im break off, an suddenly mi guess at di truth.</p>
<p>“Daisy did a drive?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” him seh afta a moment, “but a course mi ago seh mi did. Yuh si, wen wi lef New York shi did very nervous an shi did tink it woulda steady har fi drive—an dis woman rush out pan wi jus as we did a pass a car weh did a come di ada way. It all happen inna a minute, but it did look like she did waan taak to wi, though she did some wedy, Well she did know seh Daisy did turn away fos. fram di uman tuwaadz di ada kyaar, an den shi luuz ar nerv an ton bak. Di sekan taim mi han riich di wiel mi fiil di shak—it mosi did kil ar siem taim.”</p>
<p>“It rip har op—”</p>
<p>“No tell mi, old sport.” Im wins. “Eniwie—Daisy step pan it. Mi chrai mek ar stap, bot shi kudn, so mi pul aan di imerjensi briek. Den shi jrap uova ina mi lap an mi jraiv aan.</p>
<p>“She ago be all right tomorrow,” him seh presently. “Mi jus a go wait yah an si if him try fi bother har bout dat deh unpleasantness dis aftanoon. She lock harself inna har room, an if him try any brutality she a go turn di light out an on again.”</p>
<p>“Im naa go toch ar,” mi se. “Im naa tink bout har.”</p>
<p>“Mi nuh trust him, old sport.”</p>
<p>“How long yuh a go wait?”</p>
<p>“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, til dem all go a bed.”</p>
<p>A new point a view come to mi. Suppose Tom find out seh Daisy did a drive. Him might tink him see a connection inna it—im might tink anyting. Mi look pan di house; deh did have two or three bright windows dungstairs an di pink glow fram Daisy room pan di ground floor.</p>
<p>“Yuh wait yah,” mi seh. “Mi ago si if any sign a commotion deh deh.”</p>
<p>Mi walk back along di border a di lawn, travers di gravel softly, an tiptoed up di veranda steps. Di drawing-room curtains dem did open, an mi si seh di room did empty. Wen mi did a cross di porch weh wi did a dine dat deh June night three months before, mi come to a likkle rectangle a light weh mi guess was di pantry window. Di blind did draw, but mi find a rift at di sill.</p>
<p>Daisy an Tom did a sidong opposite each ada a di kitchen table, wid a plate a cold fried chicken between dem, an two bottle a ale. Im did a talk intently across di table to har, an inna im earnestness im han did fall pan an cover har own. Once in a while she look up pon him an nod in agreement.</p>
<p>Dem neva happy, an none a dem neva touch di chicken or di ale—an yet dem neva unhappy either. Deh did have a unmistakable air a natural intimacy bout di picture, an anybody woulda seh dat dem did a conspire tugeda.</p>
<p>As mi did a tiptoed fram di porch mi hear mi taxi a feel it way along di dark road toward di house. Gatsby did a wait weh mi did lef him inna di drive.</p>
<p>“Aal a it kwaiyat op de?” him ask anxiously.</p>
<p>“Yes, it all quiet.” Mi did a hesitate. “Yuh beta come home an get some sleep.”</p>
<p>Im shiek im head.</p>
<p>“Mi waan wait yah til Daisy go a bed. Good night, old sport.”</p>
<p>Im put im han dem inna im coat pocket an turn back eagerly to im scrutiny a di house, as if mi presence marred di sacredness a di vigil. So mi waak we an lef im tan op de iina di muun lait—a wach uova notn.</p>
