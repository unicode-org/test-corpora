<h2>V</h2>
<p>Wen mi come home to West Egg dat deh night mi did fraid fi a moment seh mi house did a bon. Two o'clock an di whole corner a di peninsula did a blaze wid light, weh did a fall unreal pan di shrubbery an mek thin elongating glints pan di roadside wires. Wen mi turn a corner, mi si seh a did Gatsby's house, lit fram tower to cellar.</p>
<p>At first mi did tink seh a did anodda party, a wild rout weh did resolve itself inna “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” wid all di house throw open to di game. Bot no soun neva kom. Ongl briiz ina di chrii dem, we bluo di waya dem an mek di lait dem go aaf an aan agen laik se di ous did wink inna di daaknis. As mi taxi did a groan weh mi si Gatsby a walk toward mi across him lawn.</p>
<p>“Yu plies luk laik di Worl Fier,” mi se.</p>
<p>“It do?” Him turn him eyes toward it absently. “Mi a glance inna some a di rooms. Mek wi go a Coney Island, old sport. Inna mi car.”</p>
<p>“It tuu liet.”</p>
<p>“Well, suppose we tek a plunge inna di swimming pool? Mi neva mek use a it all summer.”</p>
<p>“Mi haffi go a bed.”</p>
<p>"Arite."</p>
<p>Him wait, looking pon mi wid suppressed eagerness.</p>
<p>“Mi talk wid Miss Baker,” mi seh afta a moment. “Mi a go kaal op Daisy tumaro an invait ar uova ya fi jringk tii.”</p>
<p>“Oh, dat's all right,” him seh carelessly. “Mi nuh waan put yuh to no trouble.”</p>
<p>“Weh day woulda suit yuh?”</p>
<p>“Weh day woulda suit <i>yuh</i> ?” him correct mi quickly. “Mi nuh waan put yuh inna no trouble, yuh see.”</p>
<p>“How bout di day afta tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Im tink fi a moment. Den, wid reluctance: “Mi waan get di grass cut,” him seh.</p>
<p>Wi both look dung pan di grass—a did a shaap line weh mi ragged lawn did end an di darker, well-kept expanse a him did staat. Mi did tink seh him did mean mi grass.</p>
<p>“A wan neks likkle ting,” him seh uncertainly, an hesitate.</p>
<p>“Yuh woulda radda put it off fi a few days?” Mi ask.</p>
<p>“Oh, it nuh bout dat. At least—” Im fumbled wid a series a beginnings. “Why, mi did tink—why, look yah, old sport, yuh nuh mek much money, yuh?”</p>
<p>“Not very much.”</p>
<p>Dis did look like it did reassure him an him continue more confidently.</p>
<p>“Mi did tink yuh neva, if yuh wi pardon mi—yuh si, mi carry on a likkle business pan di side, a sort a side line, yuh andastan. An mi did tink seh if yuh nuh mek very much—Yuh a sell bonds, noh true, old sport?”</p>
<p>“Trying to.”</p>
<p>“Well, dis woulda interest yuh. It wouldn't tek up much a yuh time an yuh might pick up a nice bit a money. It happen fi be a rather confidential sort a ting.”</p>
<p>Mi realize now seh unda different circumstances dat deh conversation mighta been one a di crises a mi life. But, because di offer was obviously an tactlessly fi a service fi be rendered, mi neva have no choice except fi cut him off deh.</p>
<p>“Mi have mi han dem full,” mi seh. “Mi much obliged but mi couldn't tek on no more work.”</p>
<p>“Yuh wouldn't haffi do no business wid Wolfshiem.” Evidently him did tink seh mi did a shy weh fram di “gonnegtion” weh dem mention at lunch, but mi assure him seh him did wrong. Im wait a moment longer, hoping seh mi woulda staat a conversation, but mi did too absorbed fi be responsive, so im go home unwillingly.</p>
<p>Di evening did mek mi lightheaded an happy; Mi tink mi walk into a deep sleep as mi enter mi front door. So mi no know weda or not Gatsby go a Coney Island, or fi how many hours him “glance into rooms” while him house blaze gaudily on. Mi call up Daisy fram di office next morning, an invite har fi come to tea.</p>
<p>“No bring Tom,” mi warn har.</p>
<p>"Wah?"</p>
<p>“No bring Tom.”</p>
<p>“A who is 'Tom'?” she ask innocently.</p>
<p>Di day weh wi did agree pan did a rain. At eleven o'clock a man inna a raincoat, a drag a lawn-mower, tap pan mi front door an seh dat Mr. Gatsby did sen him ova fi cut mi grass. Dis remind mi seh mi did forget fi tell mi Finn fi come back, so mi drive inna West Egg Village fi search fi har mongst soggy whitewashed alleys an fi buy some cups an lemons an flowers.</p>
<p>Di flowers dem neva need, cause at two o'clock a greenhouse did come fram Gatsby's, wid innumerable receptacles fi contain it. An hour later di front door open nervously, an Gatsby inna a white flannel suit, silver shirt, an gold-coloured tie, hurry in. Him did pale, an deh did have dark signs a sleeplessness unda him eyes.</p>
<p>“Evriting rait?” him ask immediately.</p>
<p>“Di graas luk gud, if a dat yu miin.”</p>
<p>“Weh grass?” him ask blankly. “Oh, di grass inna di yaad.” Im look outa di window pan it, but, judging fram im expression, mi nuh believe im si a ting.</p>
<p>“Look very good,” him remarked vaguely. “One a di papers dem seh dem did tink di rain woulda stop bout four. Mi tink a did <i>The Journal</i> . Yuh have everyting yuh need inna di shape a—of tea?”</p>
<p>Mi tek him inna di pantry, weh him look likkle reproachfully at di Finn. Tugeda wi scrutinize di twelve lemon cakes fram di delicatessen shop.</p>
<p>“Dem ago do?” Mi ask.</p>
<p>“A chuu, a chuu! Dem rait!” an him add hollowly, “… old sport.”</p>
<p>Di rain cool bout half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swim like dew. Gatsby look wid vacant eyes chruu a copy a Clay's <i>Economics</i> , staatin pan di Finnish tread weh did a shake di kitchen floor, an a luk tuwaadz di bleared windows dem fram taim tu taim laik se a siiriz a invisibl bot alarming happenings did a tek plies outsaid. Finally him get up an tell mi, inna one uncertain voice, seh him a goh home.</p>
<p>“Wa mek dat?”</p>
<p>“Nobadi naa kom fi tii. It tuu liet!” Him look pan him watch as if deh did have some pressing demand pan him time elsewhere. “Mi cyan wait all day.”</p>
<p>“No bada gwaan fuul-fuul, a jos tuu minit tu fuo.”</p>
<p>Him did sidong miserably, as if mi did push him, an simultaneously deh did have di sound a one motor a turn inna mi lane. Wi both jump up, an, a likkle harrowed miself, mi go out inna di yard.</p>
<p>Anda di dripping bare lilac-trees a big open car did a come up di drive. It stop. Daisy face, tipped sideways unda a three-cornered lavender hat, look out pan mi wid a bright ecstatic smile.</p>
<p>“A dis absolutely weh yuh live, mi dearest one?”</p>
<p>Di exhilarating ripple a har voice was a wild tonic inna di rain. Mi did afi fala di soun a it fi a moutn, op an dong, wid mi iez aluon, bifuo eni wod kom chuu. A damp streak a hair did deh like a dash a blue paint across har cheek, an har han did wet wid glistening drops as mi tek it fi help har fram di car.</p>
<p>“Yuh in love wid mi,” she seh low inna mi ear, “or why mi did haffi come alone?”</p>
<p>“A dat a di secret a Castle Rackrent. Tell yuh chauffeur fi go far weh an spen one hour.”</p>
<p>“Come back inna one hour, Ferdie.” Den inna a grave murmur: “Him name is Ferdie.”</p>
<p>“Di gasoline affect him nose?”</p>
<p>“Mi nuh tink so,” she seh innocently. "Wah mek?"</p>
<p>Wi go in. To mi overwhelming surprise di living-room did deserted.</p>
<p>“Well, dat funny,” mi exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Weh funny?”</p>
<p>Shi ton har head as deh did have a light dignified knocking at di front door. Mi go out an open it. Gatsby, pale as death, wid him han dem plunged like weights inna him coat pockets, did a stan up inna a puddle a water a glare tragically inna mi eyes.</p>
<p>Wid him han dem still inna him coat pocket him stalk by mi inna di hall, turn sharply as if him did deh pan a wire, an disappear inna di living-room. It neva did a bit funny. Aware a di loud beating a mi own heart mi pull di door to against di increasing rain.</p>
<p>Fi half a minute no sound neva did a come. Den fram di living-room mi hear a sort a choking murmur an part a laugh, followed by Daisy's voice pan a clear artificial note:</p>
<p>“Mi certainly glad fi si yuh again.”</p>
<p>A pause; it endure horribly. Mi neva have nutten fi do inna di hall, so mi go inna di room.</p>
<p>Gatsby, him han dem still inna him pocket, did a recline gens di mantelpiece inna a strained counterfeit a perfect ease, even a boredom. Him head did lean back so far dat it did rest against di face a one defunct mantelpiece clock, an fram dis position him distraught eyes did a stare dung at Daisy, weh did a sidong, fraitn but graceful, pan di edge a one stiff chair.</p>
<p>“Wi don meet before,” Gatsby muttered. Him eyes dem glance momentarily at mi, an him lips dem part wid an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily di clock tek dis moment fi tilt dangerously at di pressure a him head, whereupon him turn an ketch it wid trembling fingers, an set it back inna place. Den him sidong, rigidly, him elbow pan di arm a di sofa an him chin inna him han.</p>
<p>“Mi sorry bout di clock,” him seh.</p>
<p>Mi own face did now assume a deep tropical burn. Mi couldn't muster up a single commonplace out a di thousand inna mi head.</p>
<p>“A wan uol klak,” mi tel dem iidiatli.</p>
<p>Mi tink wi all did believe fi a moment seh it did smash inna pieces pan di floor.</p>
<p>“Wi neva meet fi nuff years,” Daisy seh, har voice as matter-of-fact as it coulda eva be.</p>
<p>“Five years next November.”</p>
<p>Di automatic quality a Gatsby's ansa set wi all back at least anodda minute. Mi did have dem both pan dem foot wid di desperate suggestion seh dem help mi mek tea inna di kitchen wen di demoniac Finn bring it in pan a tray.</p>
<p>Amid di welcome confusion a cups an cakes a certain physical decency establish itself. Gatsby get himself inna a shadow an, while Daisy an mi did a talk, him look concientiously fram one to di ada a wi wid tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself, mi mek an excuse at di first possible moment, an get to mi feet.</p>
<p>“Weh yuh a go?” Gatsby demand in immediate alarm.</p>
<p>“Mi ago come back.”</p>
<p>“Mi haffi talk to yuh bout someting before yuh go.”</p>
<p>Im fala mi wildly inna di kitchen, close di door, an whisper: “Oh, God!” inna a miserable way.</p>
<p>“Weh di mata?”</p>
<p>“Dis a one terrible mistake,” him seh, a shake him head fram side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”</p>
<p>“Yu jos shiem, dat a aal,” an laki mi ad se: “Daisy shiem tu.”</p>
<p>“She embarrassed?” him repeated incredulously.</p>
<p>“Just as much as yuh is.”</p>
<p>“No chat so loud.”</p>
<p>“Yu a gwaan laik wan likl bwai,” mi brok out impatientli. “No onggl dat, bot yu ruul. Daisy a sidong iin de aal a im wan.”</p>
<p>Im raise im han fi stop mi wod dem, look pan mi wid unforgettable reproach, an, opening di door cautiously, go back inna di ada room.</p>
<p>Mi walk out di back way—jus like Gatsby did do wen him did mek him nervous circuit a di house half an hour before—an run fi a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves mek a fabric against di rain. Once more it did a pour, an mi irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby's gardener, abounded inna small muddy swamps an prehistoric marshes. Notn neva de fi luk pan fram anda di chrii ekssep Gatsby big big ous, so mi luk pan it, laik Kant a im choch stiipl, fi aaf a owa. A brewer did build it early inna di “period” craze, a decade before, an deh did have a story seh him did agree fi pay five years taxes pan all di neighboring cottages dem if di owna dem woulda have dem roofs datched wid straw. Miebi dem refusal tek di heart outa him plan fi Found a Family—im go inna wan immediate decline. Him pickney dem sell him house wid di black wreath weh still deh pan di door. Americans, while dem did willing, even eager, fi be serfs, dem always been obstinate bout being peasantry.</p>
<p>Afta aaf owa, di son shain agen, an di grosa otomobil ron roun Gatsby jraiv wid di raw matiirial fi im sorvant dem dina—mi did fiil shuor se im naa go iit no spuonful. A maid staat open di upper windows a him house, appear momentarily inna each, an, leaning fram di big central bay, spat meditatively inna di garden. A did time mi go back. While di rain did a gwaan it did look like di murmur a dem voices, a rise an a swelling likkle now an den wid gusts a emotion. But inna di new silence mi feel seh silence did fall widin di house too.</p>
<p>Mi go in—afta mi mek every possible noise inna di kitchen, short a pushing ova di stove—but mi nuh believe dem hear a sound. Dem did a sidong a di tuu en a di sofa, a luk pan dem wan aneda laik se som kweschan did aks, ar did de ina di ier, an evri vestige a embarassment did gaan. Daisy face did smear wid tears, an wen mi come in she jump up an staat wipe at it wid har handkerchief before a mirror. But a did a change inna Gatsby weh did simply confounding. Im did a glow; widout a word or a gesture a exultation a new well-being radiate fram him an fill di likkle room.</p>
<p>“Oh, hello, old sport,” him seh, as if him neva si mi fi years. Mi did tink fi a moment seh him did a go shake hands.</p>
<p>“It stap rien.”</p>
<p>“It?” Wen him realize weh mi did a talk bout, seh a did twinkle-bells a sunshine inna di room, him smile like a weather man, like a ecstatic patron a recurrent light, an repeat di news to Daisy. “Wa yu tingk bout dat, rien tap faal.”</p>
<p>“Mi glad, Jay.” Har throat, full a aching, grieving beauty, tell only bout har unexpected joy.</p>
<p>“Mi waahn yu an Daisy fi kom uova a mi yaad,” im se, “mi wuda laik fi shuo ar roun.”</p>
<p>“Yuh sure yuh waan mi fi come?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely, old sport.”</p>
<p>Daisy go opstairs fi wash har face—too late mi did tink wid humiliation a mi towels—while Gatsby an mi did a wait pan di lawn.</p>
<p>“Mi ous luk gud, iihn?” him demand. “Si how di whole front a it ketch di light.”</p>
<p>Mi agree seh it did splendid.</p>
<p>"Yea." Him eyes dem did a go ova it, every arched door an square tower. “It tek mi jus three years fi earn di money weh buy it.”</p>
<p>“Mi did tink yuh did inherit yuh money.”</p>
<p>“Mi did, old sport,” him seh automatically, “but mi lose most a it inna di big panic—di panic a di war.”</p>
<p>Mi tink him hardly did know weh him did a seh, cause wen mi ask him weh business him did inna him ansa: “A mi affair dat,” before him realize seh a neva an appropriate reply.</p>
<p>“Oh, mi been inna several tings,” him correct himself. “Mi did inna di drug business an den mi did inna di oil business. But mi nuh deh inna non a dem now.” Im look pon mi wid more attention. “Yuh mean yuh did a tink bout weh mi did a propose di neda nait?”</p>
<p>Bifuo mi kuda ansa, Daisy kom outa di ous an tuu ruod a braas boton pan ar jres did a shain inna di sonlait.</p>
<p>“Dat big place <i>deh deh</i> ?” shi baal out a point.</p>
<p>“Yuh like it?”</p>
<p>“Mi love it, but mi nuh see how yuh live deh all alone.”</p>
<p>“Mi keep it always full a interesting people, night an day. People weh do interesting tings. Celebrated people.”</p>
<p>Insted a tek di shortcut along di Sound we go dung to di road an enter by di big postern. Wid enchanting murmurs Daisy admire dis aspect or dat a di feudal silhouette gens di sky, admire di gardens, di sparkling odor a jonquils an di frothy odor a hawthorn an plum blossoms an di pale gold odor a kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange fi reach di marble steps an find no stir a bright dresses in an out di door, an hear no sound but bird voices inna di trees.</p>
<p>An inside, as we did a wander thru Marie Antoinette music-rooms an Restoration Salons, mi did feel seh deh did have guests weh did a hide behind every couch an table, unda order fi be breathlessly silent until wi did pass through. As Gatsby did a close di door a “di Merton College Library” mi coulda did sworn seh mi hear di owl-eyed man break inna ghostly laughter.</p>
<p>Wi go upstairs, chruu period bedrooms swathed inna rose an lavender silk an vivid wid new flowers, chruu dressing-rooms an poolrooms, an bathrooms wid sunken baths—intruding into one chamber weh a disheveled man inna pajamas did a do liver exercises pan di floor. A did Mr. Klipspringer, di “boarder.” Mi did si him a waak hungry bout di beach da maanin de. Finally wi come to Gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom an a bath, an a Adam's study, weh we did a sit dung an drink a glass a some Chartreuse weh him did tek fram a cupboard inna di wall.</p>
<p>Im neva did stop look pon Daisy, an mi tink im did revalue everyting inna im yaad according to di measure a response it did a draw fram har well-loved eyes. Somtaim tu, im did a luk roun pan im tingz dem ina wan dazed wie, laik se inna ar akchual an astounding prezans non a it neva riil no muor. Once him nearly topple dung a flight a stairs.</p>
<p>Him bedroom was di simplest room a all—except weh di dresser did garnish wid a toilet set a pure dull gold. Daisy tek di brush wid delight, an smooth har hair, weh Gatsby sidong an shade him eyes an staat laugh.</p>
<p>“A di funniest ting, old sport,” him seh hilariously. “Mi cyan—Wen mi try fi—”</p>
<p>Im did pass visiblely chruu two states an did a go inna a third. Afta him embarrassment an him unreasoning joy him did consume wid wonder at har presence. Im did full a di idea so lang, im did a dream it rait chuu tu di en, im did a wiet wid im teet dem set, so fi se it, a wan inconceivable pitch a intensity. Now, inna di reaction, him did a run dung like a over-wound clock.</p>
<p>Recovering himself inna a minute him open fi wi two hulking patent cabinets weh did hold him massed suits an dressing-gowns an ties, an him shirts, pailed like bricks inna stacks a dozen high.</p>
<p>“Mi have a man inna England weh buy mi clothes. Him sen ova a selection a tings at di beginning a each season, spring an fall.”</p>
<p>Im tek out a pile a shirt an staat throw dem, one by one, before wi, shirt a sheer linen an thick silk an fine flannel, weh did lose dem folds as dem did a fall an cover di table inna many-coloured disarray. While we did a admire him bring more an di soft rich heap mount higher—shirts wid stripes an scrolls an plaids inna coral an apple-green an lavender an faint orange, wid monograms a indian blue. Suddenly, wid a strained sound, Daisy ben har head inna di shirts an staat cry stormily.</p>
<p>“Dem a such beautiful shirts,” she sob, har voice muffled inna di thick folds. “It mek mi sad cause mi neva si such—such beautiful shirts before.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Afta di house, wi did fi si di grounds an di swimming pool, an di hydroplane, an di midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby's window it staat rain agen, so wi did a stan op inna a row a look pon di corrugated surface a di Sound.</p>
<p>“If it neva fi di mist wi coulda see yuh yaad across di bay,” seh Gatsby. “Yuh always have a green light weh burn all night at di end a yuh dock.”</p>
<p>Daisy put har arm chruu him abruptly, but him did look like him did absorb inna weh him did jus seh. Possibly it did come to him seh di colossal significance a dat deh light did now vanish fi eva. Compared to di great distance weh did separate him fram Daisy it did look very near to har, almost touching har. It did look as close as a star to di moon. Now it was again a green light pan a dock. Him count a enchanted objects did diminish by one.</p>
<p>Mi staat walk bout di room, a examine various indefinite objects inna di half darkness. A big photograph a one elderly man inna yachting costume attract mi, hang pan di wall ova him desk.</p>
<p>“A who dis?”</p>
<p>“Dat? Dat a Mr. Dan Cody, uol sport.”</p>
<p>Di name did sound faintly familiar.</p>
<p>“Im ded nou.Im yuus tu bi mi bes fren ierz ago.”</p>
<p>Deh did have a likkle picture a Gatsby, also inna yachting costume, pan di bureau—Gatsby wid him head throw back defiantly—tek apparently wen him was bout eighteen.</p>
<p>“Mi adore it,” Daisy seh. “Di pompadour! Yuh neva tell mi seh yuh have a pompadour—or a yacht.”</p>
<p>“Look pon dis,” Gatsby seh quickly. “Yahso a lot a clippings—bout yuh.”</p>
<p>Dem did a stan up side by side a examine it. Mi did a go aks fi si di rubi dem wen di fuon ring, an Gatsby tek op di risiiva.</p>
<p>“Yes... Well, mi cyan talk now... Mi cyan talk now, old sport... Mi seh a <i>likkle</i> town... Him mus know weh a likkle town is... Well, him nuh use to wi if Detroit a him idea a likkle town...”</p>
<p>Im ring off.</p>
<p>“Come yah <i>quick</i> !” Daisy baal out pan di window.</p>
<p>Di rien did stil a faal, bot di daaknis did don paat inna di wes, an a did wan pink an guol billow a foamy kloud uova di sii.</p>
<p>“Luk pan dat,” shi wispa, an den afta a moment: “Mi wuda laik fi jos get wan a dem pink kloud de an put yu iina it an push yu roun.”</p>
<p>Mi try fi go den, but dem neva waan hear bout it; perhaps mi presence mek dem feel more satisfactorily alone.</p>
<p>“Mi know weh wi a go do,” Gatsby seh, “wi a go mek Klipspringer play di piano.”</p>
<p>Im go outa di ruum an kaal “Ewing!” an come back inna a few minutes wid an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, wid shell-rimmed glasses an scanty blond hair. Im did now decently clothed inna a “sport shirt,” open at di neck, sneakers, an duck trousers a one nebulous hue.</p>
<p>“Wi did interrupt yuh exercise?” Daisy aks politely.</p>
<p>“Mi did a sleep,” Mr. Klipspringer baal out, inna a spasm a embarrassment. “Dat mean, mi <i>did</i> a sleep. Den mi get up...”</p>
<p>“Klipspringer play di piano,” seh Gatsby, cutting him off. “Yuh nuh, Ewing, old sport?”</p>
<p>“Mi no play well. Mi no—hardly play at all. Mi all out a prac—”</p>
<p>“Wi a go dungstairs,” Gatsby interrupted. Im flip a switch. Di grey windows dem disappear as di house did a glow full a light.</p>
<p>Inna di music-room Gatsby turn on a solitary lamp beside di piano. Im lait Daisy cigarette fram a trembling match, an sidong wid har pan a couch far across di room, weh neva have no light lef weh di gleaming floor did a bounce inna fram di hall.</p>
<p>Wen Klipspringer did play “The Love Nest” him turn roun pan di bench an search unhappily fi Gatsby inna di gloom.</p>
<p>“Mi all out a practice, yuh see. Mi did tell yuh seh mi couldn't play. Mi all out a prac—”</p>
<p>“No talk so much, old sport,” Gatsby command. "Ramp!"</p>
<blockquote class="verse"><div>
<p>
<span>“Ina di maanin,</span>
<br/>
<span>Inna di evening,</span>
<br/>
<span class="i1">Ain't we got fun—”</span>
</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Outside di wind did loud an a did a likl flow a thunder along di Sound. All di lights dem did a go on inna West Egg now; di electric trains, man-carrying, did a plung home thru di rain fram New York. A did di hour a one profound human change, an excitement did a generate pan di air.</p>
<blockquote class="verse"><div>
<p>

<br/>
<span class="i2">In between time—”</span>
</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As mi go ova fi seh goodbye mi si seh di expression a bewilderment did come back inna Gatsby face, as if a faint doubt did occur to him as to di quality a him present happiness. Almost five years! It mosi did have somes even dat deh aftanoon wen Daisy did a fall short a him dreams—not chruu har own fault, but because a di colossal vitality a him illusion. It did gaan beyond har, beyond everyting. Him did throw himself inna it wid a creative passion, adding to it all di time, a deck it out wid every bright feather weh did a drift him way. No amount a fire or freshness can challenge weh a man can store up inna him ghostly heart.</p>
<p>As mi watch him him adjust himself likkle, visibly. Him han tek hold a hars, an as she seh someting low inna him ear him turn toward har wid a rush a emotion. Mi tink dat deh voice did a hold him most, wid it fluctuating, feverish warmth, cause it couldn't be over-dreamed—dat voice was a deathless song.</p>
<p>Dem did forget mi, but Daisy glance up an hold out har han; Gatsby neva know mi now at all. Mi look once more at dem an dem look back at mi, remotely, possessed by intense life. Den mi go outa di room an dong di marble step dem inna di rain, lef dem deh tugeda.</p>

<div id="chapter-6">
<h2>VI</h2>
<p>Bout dis time a ambitious young reporter fram New York arrive one morning a Gatsby's door an ask him if him have anyting fi seh.</p>
<p>“Anyting fi seh bout weh?” Gatsby aks politely.</p>
<p>“Why—any statement fi gi out.”</p>
<p>It transpired afta a confused five minutes dat di man did hear Gatsby's name roun him office inna a connection weh him either wouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. Dis was him day off an wid laudable initiative him did hurry out “fi see.”</p>
<p>A did a random shot, an yet di reporter's instinct did right. Gatsby's notoriety, spread bout by di hundreds who did accept him hospitality an so become authorities pan him past, did increase all summer until him fall jus short a being news. Contemporary legends such as di “underground pipeline to Canada” attached demself to him, an deh did have one persistent story dat him neva live inna a house at all, but inna a boat weh look like a house an dem did a move secretly up an dung di Long Island shore. Jus why dem inventions yah was a source a satisfaction to James Gatz a North Dakota, a nuh easy fi seh.</p>
<p>James Gatz—dat was really, or at least legally, him name. Im did change it at di age a seventeen an at di specific moment weh im did si di beginning a im career—wen im si Dan Cody's yacht drop anchor ova di most insidious flat pan Lake Superior. A did James Gatz weh did a loaf along di beach dat deh aftanuun inna a torn green jersey an a pair a canvas pants, but a did Jay Gatsby weh did a borrow a rowboat, pull out to di <i>Tuolomee</i> , an tell Cody seh a wind might ketch him an break him up inna half an hour.</p>
<p>Mi suppose him did have di name ready fi a long time, even den. Him parents dem was shiftless an unsuccessful farm people—him imagination neva really accept dem as him parents at all. Di truth was dat Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang fram him Platonic conception a himself. Im was a son a God—a phrase weh, if it mean anyting, mean jus dat—an im mus be bout Him Fada business, di service a one vast, vulgar, an meretricious beauty. So him invent jus di sort a Jay Gatsby weh a seventeen-year-old bwoy woulda be likely fi invent, an to dis conception him did faithful to di end.</p>
<p>Fi ova a year him did a beat him way along di south shore a Lake Superior as a clam-digger an a salmon-fisher or inna any ada capacity weh bring him food an bed. Him brown, hardening body did live naturally chruu di half-fierce, half-lazy work a di bracing days. Him did know women early, an since dem spoil him him did become contemptuous a dem, a young virgins cause dem neva ignorant, a di others cause dem did hysterical bout tings weh inna him overwhelming self-absorption him tek fi granted.</p>
<p>But him heart did inna a constant, turbulent riot. Di most grotesque an fantastic conceits haunted him inna him bed at night. A universe a ineffable gaudiness spun itself out inna him brain while di clock did a tick pan di washstand an di moon did a soak wid wet light him tangled clothes pan di floor. Each night him add to di pattern a him fancies until drowsiness close dung upon some vivid scene wid an oblivious embrace. Fi a while dem reveries deh did provide an outlet fi him imagination; dem was a satisfactory hint a di unreality a reality, a promise dat di rock a di worl did found securely pan a fairy's wing.</p>
<p>Wan instinct toward him future glory did lead him, some months before, to di likkle Lutheran College a St. Olaf's inna southern Minnesota. Im stay deh fi two weeks, dismayed at it ferocious indifference to di drums a im destiny, to destiny itself, an despising di janitor's work wid which im did a go pay im way through. Den him drift back to Lake Superior, an him did still a look fi someting fi do pan di day wen Dan Cody's yacht did drop anchor inna di shallows alongshore.</p>
<p>Cody was fifty years old den, a product a di Nevada silver fields, a di Yukon, a every rush fi metal since seventy-five. Di transactions in Montana copper weh mek him many times a millionaire find him physically robust but pan di verge a soft-mindedness, an, suspecting dis, an infinite numba a women did a try separate him fram him money. Di none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, di newspaper woman, did play Madame de Maintenon to him weakness an sen him to sea inna a yacht, was common property a di turgid journalism inna 1902. Him did a coast along all too hospitable shores fi five years wen him turn up as James Gatz's de Little Bay Girls inna Little Bay.</p>
<p>To young Gatz, resting pan him oars an looking up at di railed deck, dat deh yacht did represent all di beauty an glamour inna di worl. Mi suppose him did a smile at Cody—im did probably discover seh people did like him wen him did a smile. At any rate Cody ask him a few questions (one a dem elicit di brand new name) an find out seh him did quick an extravagantly ambitious. A few days later him tek him to Duluth an buy him a blue coat, six pairs a white duck trousers, an a yachting cap. An wen di <i>Tuolomee dem</i> lef fi go a Wes Indiz an di Barbary Coast, Gatsby lef tu.</p>
<p>Im did a employ inna a vague personal capacity—while im did a stay wid Cody im did inna turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, an even jailor, fi Dan Cody sober did know weh lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be bout, an im did provide fi such contingencies by reposing more an more trust inna Gatsby. Di arrangement laas five years, during which di boat did go three times roun di Continent. It mighta did last indefinitely except fi di fact dat Ella Kaye did come pan board one night inna Boston an a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.</p>
<p>Mi memba di portrait a him op inna Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid man wid a hard, empty face—di pioneer debauchee, weh during one phase a American life bring back to di Eastern seaboard di savage violence a di frontier brothel an saloon. A did indirectly due to Cody dat Gatsby did drink so likkle. Somtaim inna di course a gay parties women use to rub champagne inna him hair; fi himself him form di habit fi let liquor alone.</p>
<p>An a fram Cody him get money—a legacy a twenty-five thousand dollars. Him neva get it. Im neva andastan di legal device weh dem did a use gens im, but weh did lef a di millions dem did go intact to Ella Kaye. Him did lef wid him singularly appropriate education; di vague contour a Jay Gatsby did full out to di substantiality a one man.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Im tell mi all dis very much later, but mi put it dung yah wid di idea fi explode dem first wild rumors bout im antecedents, weh neva even faintly true. Moreover him tell it to mi at a time a confusion, wen mi did reach di point a believe everyting an nutten bout him. So mi tek advantage a dis short halt, while Gatsby, so fi seh, ketch him breath, fi clear dis set a misconceptions weh.</p>
<p>It was a halt, too, inna mi association wid him affairs. Fi several weeks mi neva see him or hear him voice pan di phone—mostly mi did deh inna New York, a trot roun wid Jordan an a try ingratiate miself wid har senile aunt—but finally mi go ova to him yaad one Sunday aftanuun. Mi neva deh deh fi two minutes wen somebody bring Tom Buchanan in fi a drink. Mi did shak, naturally, but di really surprising ting was dat it neva happen before.</p>
<p>Dem was a party a three pan horseback—Tom an a man name Sloane an a pretty woman inna a brown riding-habit, weh did deh deh before.</p>
<p>“Mi glad fi si yu,” Gatsby se, a stan op pan im porch. “Mi glad seh yuh drop in.”</p>
<p>As if dem did care!</p>
<p>“Sidong rait dong. Tek a cigarette or a cigar.” Im walk roun di room quickly, a ring bells. “Mi wi have someting fi drink fi yuh inna jus a minute.”</p>
<p>Im did profoundly affected by di fact seh Tom did deh deh. But him woulda be uneasy anyhow until him did gi dem someting, realizing in a vague way seh dat was all dem did come fah. Mr. Sloane neva waan nutten. A lemonade? No, tanks. A likkle champagne? Notn at all, tanks... mi sorry—</p>
<p>“Yuh did have a nice ride?”</p>
<p>“Very good roads roun yah.”</p>
<p>“Mi suppose di automobiles—”</p>
<p>"Mhm."</p>
<p>Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turn to Tom, who did accept di introduction as a stranger.</p>
<p>“Mi believe wi did meet somwe before, Mr. Buchanan.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” Tom seh, gruffly polite, but obviously neva memba. “So wi did. Mi memba gud gud.”</p>
<p>“Bout two weeks ago.”</p>
<p>“A so it go. Yuh did deh wid Nick yah.”</p>
<p>“Mi know yuh wife,” Gatsby continued, almost aggressively.</p>
<p>“A so dat?”</p>
<p>Tom turn to mi.</p>
<p>“Yuh live near yah, Nick?”</p>
<p>“Next door.”</p>
<p>“A so dat?”</p>
<p>Mr. Sloane neva enter inna di conversation, but lounged back haughtily inna him chair; di woman neva seh notn either—til unexpectedly, afta two highballs, she become cordial.</p>
<p>“Wi all ago come ova to yuh next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggest. “Weh yuh seh?”</p>
<p>“Certainly; mi woulda be delighted fi have yuh.”</p>
<p>“Be ver’ nice,” seh Mr. Sloane, widout gratitude. “Well—tingk oughta fi staat home.”</p>
<p>“Please don't hurry,” Gatsby urge dem. Him did have control a himself now, an him did waan see more a Tom. “Why yuh nuh—why yuh nuh stay fi supper? Mi wouldn't be surprised if some other people drop in from New York.”</p>
<p>“Yuh come to supper wid <i>mi</i> ,” seh di lady enthusiastically. “Unu tuu.”</p>
<p>Dis did include mi. Mr. Sloane get up pan him foot dem.</p>
<p>“Come along,” him seh—but to har only.</p>
<p>“Mi mean it,” she insist. “Mi woulda love fi have yuh. Lots a room.”</p>
<p>Gatsby look pan mi wid questioningly. Him did waan go an him neva see seh Mr. Sloane did decide seh him shudn't go.</p>
<p>“Mi fried mi naa go iebl,” mi se.</p>
<p>“Well, yuh come,” she urged, concentrating pan Gatsby.</p>
<p>Mr. Sloane murmured someting close to har ear.</p>
<p>“Wi naa go lieta if wi staat nou,” shi insis loud.</p>
<p>“Mi nuh have a horse,” Gatsby seh. “Mi use to ride inna di army, but mi neva buy a horse. Mi ago haffi follow yuh inna mi car. Excuse mi fi jus a minute.”</p>
<p>Di res a wi walk out pan di porch, weh Sloane an di lady staat a impassioned conversation aside.</p>
<p>“Mi Gad, mi biliiv se di man a kom,” Tamas se. “Im no nuo se shi no waahn im?”</p>
<p>“She seh she waan him.”</p>
<p>“She have a big dinner party an him naa go know a soul deh.” Im frown. “Mi wanda we inna di devl im miit Daisy. Bai Gad, mi maita uol-taim ina mi aidiya dem, bot uman ron roun tuu moch dem ya die ya fi suut mi. Dem miit aal kain a kraasiz fish.”</p>
<p>Suddenly Mr. Sloane an di lady walk dung di steps an mount dem horses.</p>
<p>“Kom on,” se Misa Sloane tu Tamas, “wi liet. Wi afi go.” An den tu mi: “Tel im se wi kudn wiet, no chruu?”</p>
<p>Tom an mi shake wi han, di res a wi exchange a cool nod, an dem trot quick dong di drive, disappear anda di August foliage jos az Gatsby, wid hat an light overcoat inna han, come outa di front door.</p>
<p>Tom did evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for pan di following Saturday night him come wid har to Gatsby's party. Miebi him presence gi di evening it peculiar quality a oppressiveness—it stan out inna mi memory fram Gatsby's ada parties dat deh summer. Deh did have di same people, or at least di same sort a people, di same profusion a champagne, di same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion, but mi did feel an unpleasantness inna di air, a pervading harshness weh neva deh deh before. Or perhaps mi did jus grown used to it, grown fi accept West Egg as a world complete inna itself, wid it own standards an it own great figures, second to notn cause it neva have no consciousness a being so, an now mi did a look pan it again, chruu Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening fi look thru new eyes at tings upon which yuh spend yuh own powers of adjustment.</p>
<p>Dem reach at twilight, an, as wi did a stroll out mongst di sparkling hundreds, Daisy's voice did a play murmurous tricks inna har throat.</p>
<p>“Dem ting deh excite mi <i>so</i> ,” she whispered. “If yuh waan kiss mi any time during di evening, Nick, jus mek mi know an mi wi glad fi arrange it fi yuh. Jus mention mi name. Or present a green card. Mi a gi out green—”</p>
<p>“Look roun,” Gatsby suggest.</p>
<p>“Mi a look roun. Mi a have a marvellous—”</p>
<p>“Yu afi si di fies a nof piipl we yu ier bout.”</p>
<p>Tom's arrogant eyes did a roam di crowd.</p>
<p>“Wi nuh go roun much,” him seh; “in fact, mi did jus a tink seh mi nuh know a soul yah.”</p>
<p>“Miebi yuh know dat deh lady.” Gatsby did indicate a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid a one woman weh did a sidong inna state unda a white-plum tree. Tom an Daisy stare, wid dat deh peculiarly unreal feeling weh accompany di recognition a one hitherto ghostly celebrity a di movies.</p>
<p>“She lovely,” Daisy seh.</p>
<p>“Di man weh a ben ova har a har director.”</p>
<p>Im tek dem ceremoniously fram group to group:</p>
<p>“Mrs. Buchanan... an Mr. Buchanan—” Afta a instant hesitation him add: “di polo player.”</p>
<p>“Oh no,” Tom objected quickly, “not mi.”</p>
<p>But evidently di sound a it pleased Gatsby fi Tom remain “di polo player” fi di rest a di evening.</p>
<p>“Mi neva meet so much celebrity,” Daisy seh. “Mi did like dat deh man—weh him name?—wid di sort a blue nose.”</p>
<p>Gatsby identify him, an add seh him was a likkle producer.</p>
<p>“Well, mi did like him anyhow.”</p>
<p>“Mi woulda a likkle radda not be di polo player,” seh Tom pleasantly, “Mi woulda radda look at all dem famous people in—in oblivion.”</p>
<p>Daisy an Gatsby did a dance. Mi memba mi did surprised by him graceful, conservative foxtrot—mi neva si him dance before. Den dem saunter ova to mi yaad an sidong pan di steps fi half an hour, while at har request mi stay watchfully inna di garden. “In case it's a fire or a flood,” she explain, “or any act of God.”</p>
<p>Tom appear fram him oblivion as wi did a sidong fi supper tugeda. “Yuh mind if mi eat wid some people ova yah?” im seh. “A fellow a get off some funny stuff.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” ansa Daisy genial, “an if yuh waan tek dong eni adres yahso a mi likl guol pensl.”... Shi luk roun afta a moment an tel mi se di gyal did “kaman bot priti,” an mi did nuo se eksep fi di haaf-a-ouwa shi did de alone wid Gatsby shi neva did a av no gud taim.</p>
<p>Wi did deh a one tipsy table. Dat was mi fault—Gatsby did get call to di phone, an mi did enjoy dem same people deh only two weeks before. But weh did a amuse mi den turn septic pan di air now.</p>
<p>“How yuh feel, Miss Baedeker?”</p>
<p>Di gyal weh mi did a address did a try, an it neva get, fi slump gens mi shoulda. Wen dem aks dis, shi sidong op an uopn ar yai dem.</p>
<p>“Weh?”</p>
<p>A massive an lethargic woman, weh did a urge Daisy fi play golf wid har a di local club tomorrow, did a taak inna Miss Baedeker's defence:</p>
<p>“Oh, she all right now. Wen she don drink five or six cocktails she always staat scream like dat. Mi tell har she shuda lef it alone.”</p>
<p>“Mi do lef it alone,” di accused affirmed hollowly.</p>
<p>“Wi hear yuh a baal, so mi seh to Doc Civet yah: 'A somebody weh need yuh help, Doc.' ”</p>
<p>“She much obliged, mi sure,” seh anodda fren, widout gratitude, “but yuh get har dress all wet wen yuh stuck har head inna di pool.”</p>
<p>“Anyting mi hate is fi get mi head stuck inna a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “Dem almost drown mi once ova inna New Jersey.”</p>
<p>“Den yuh shuda lef it alone,” Doctor Civet counter.</p>
<p>“Speak fi yuhself!” Miss Baedeker baal out violently. “Yuh han a shake. Mi wouldn't mek yuh operate pan mi!”</p>
<p>A did like dat. Almost di laas ting mi memba was stan up wid Daisy an watch di moving-picture director an him Star. Dem did still deh unda di white-plum tree an dem face did a touch except fi a pale, thin ray a moonlight between. It come to mi seh him did a bend toward har all evening fi get dis proximity, an even while mi did a watch mi si him stoop one ultimate degree an kiss at har cheek.</p>
<p>“Mi like har,” Daisy seh, “mi tink she lovely.”</p>
<p>But di rest did offen har—an inarguably because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion. Shi did api bai West Egg, dis unprecedented “place” weh Broadway did staat pan a Long Island fishing village—appalled bai it raw vigor weh chafed anda di uol euphemisms an by di too obtrusive fate weh did a herd it inhabitants along a shortcut fram notn tu notn. Shi si someting awful inna di very simplicity weh shi fail fi andastan.</p>
<p>Mi did sidong pan di front step wid dem wile dem did a wait fi dem car. It did daak yah inna front; only di bright door sen ten square feet a light volleying out inna di soft black morning. Somtaim a shado move gens a dressing-room blind above, gi way to anodda shadow, an indefinite procession a shadows, weh rouged an powdered inna an invisible glass.</p>
<p>“A who is dis Gatsby anyhow?” Tom demand suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”</p>
<p>“Weh yuh hear dat?” Mi aks.</p>
<p>“Mi neva ier it. Mi imajin it. A nof a dem nyuu rich piipl ya a jos big bootleggers, yu nuo.”</p>
<p>“Not Gatsby,” mi seh shortly.</p>
<p>Im did silent fi a moment. Di pebbles dem a di drive did a crunch unda him foot dem.</p>
<p>“Well, him certainly mus did strain himself fi get dis menagerie tugeda.”</p>
<p>A breeze stir di gray haze a Daisy's fur collar.</p>
<p>“At least dem more interesting dan di people dem weh we know,” she seh wid an effort.</p>
<p>“Yuh neva look so interested.”</p>
<p>“Well, mi did.”</p>
<p>Tom laugh an turn to mi.</p>
<p>“Yu did nuotis Daisy fies wen da gyal de aks ar fi put ar anda wahn kuol shuor?”</p>
<p>Daisy staat sing wid di music inna a husky, rhythmic whisper, an bring out a meaning inna each word weh it neva have before an woulda neva have again. Wen di melody rise har voice break up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, an each change tipped out a likkle a har warm human magic upon di air.</p>
<p>“Nof piipl kom we neva get invait,” shi se suudn. “Dat girl deh neva get invite. Dem jus force dem way in an him too polite fi object.”</p>
<p>“Mi woulda like fi know who him is an weh him do,” Tom insist. “An mi tink mi ago mek a point fi find out.”</p>
<p>“Mi can tell yuh right now,” she ansa. “Im did own some drugstore, a lot a drugstore. Him build dem up himself.”</p>
<p>Di dilatory limousine come rolling up di drive.</p>
<p>“Gud night, Nick,” Daisy seh.</p>
<p>Har glance lef mi an look fi di lighted top a di steps, weh “Three O'Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad likkle waltz a dat deh year, did a drift outa di open door. Afta all, inna di very casualness a Gatsby's party deh did have romantic possibilities totally absent fram har world. Weh did deh up deh inna di song weh did look like it did a call har back inside? Weh woulda happen now inna di dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest woulda arrive, a person infinitely rare an fi be marveled at, some authentically radiant young girl who wid one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, woulda blot out dem five years a unwavering devotion.</p>
<p>Mi stay late dat deh night. Gatsby ask mi fi wait until him free, an mi linger inna di garden until di inevitable swimming party did run up, chilled an exalted, fram di black beach, until di lights dem did extinguish inna di guestrooms dem ovahead. Wen him come dung di steps at last di tanned skin did draw unusually tight pan him face, an him eyes dem did bright an tired.</p>
<p>“Shi neva laik it,” im se siem taim.</p>
<p>“Af course she did.”</p>
<p>“She neva like it,” him insist. “She neva have a good time.”</p>
<p>Him did silent, an mi guess at him unuttable depression.</p>
<p>“Mi feel far weh fram har,” him seh. “It aad fi mek har andastan.”</p>
<p>“Yuh mean bout di dance?”</p>
<p>“Di dance?” Im dismiss all di dances dem weh im did gi wid a snap a im finga dem. “Old sport, di dance nuh important.”</p>
<p>Him neva waan nutten less a Daisy dan dat she shuda go to Tom an seh: “Mi neva lov yuh.” Afta she did obliterate four years wid dat deh sentence dem coulda decide upon di more practical measures fi tek. One a dem was dat, afta she did free, dem did fi go back a Louisville an get married fram har house—jus as if it was five years ago.</p>
<p>“An shi no andastan,” im se. “She used to be able fi undastan. We woulda sit fi hours—”</p>
<p>Im break off an staat walk up an dung a desolate path a fruit rinds an discarded favors an crushed flowers.</p>
<p>“Mi wouldn't ask too much a har,” mi ventured. “Yuh cyaan repeat di past.”</p>
<p>“Chan't repeat di past?” him cry incredulously. “Why of course yuh can!”</p>
<p>Im look roun im wildly, as if di past did a lurk yah inna di shadow a im yaad, jus outa reach a im han.</p>
<p>“Mi a go fix everyting jus di way it did deh before,” him seh, a nod determinedly. “She ago si.”</p>
<p>Im did a taak a lat bout di past, an mi gather seh im did waan recover someting, some idea a imself perhaps, weh did go inna loving Daisy. Him life did confused an disordered since den, but if him coulda once return to a certain starting place an go ova it all slowly, him coulda find out weh dat deh ting was...</p>
<p>… One autumn night, five years before, dem did a walk dung di street wen di leaves dem did a fall, an dem come to a place weh neva have no trees an di sidewalk did white wid moonlight. Dem stop yah an turn toward each other. Now it was a cool night wid dat deh mysterious excitement inna it weh come at di two changes a di year. Di quiet lights dem inna di house dem did a hum out inna di darkness an a did a stir an bustle mongst di stars dem. Outa di corner a him eye Gatsby si seh di blocks a di sidewalks dem did really form a ladder an mount to a secret place above di trees—im coulda climb to it, if him climb alone, an once deh him coulda suck pan di pap a life, gulp dung di incomparable milk a wonder.</p>
<p>Him heart beat faster as Daisy's white face come up to him own. Him did know seh wen him kiss dis girl, an forever wed him unuterable visions to har perishable breath, him mind woulda neva romp again like di mind a God. So him wait, lisn fi a moment longer to di tuning-fork weh did hit pan a star. Den him kiss har. Wen him touch him lips she blossom fi him like a flower an di incarnation did complete.</p>
<p>Thru all weh him seh, even chruu him appalling sentimentality, mi did memba someting—an elusive rhythm, a fragment a lost words, weh mi did hear somewhere a long time ago. Fi a moment a phrase did a try tek shape inna mi mout an mi lips did a part like a dumb man's, as if deh did have more struggling pan dem dan a wisp a startled air. But dem neva mek no sound, an weh mi did almost memba was uncommunicable forever.</p>
