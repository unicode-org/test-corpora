<h2>III</h2>
<p>Myuuzik did de de fram mi nieba ous chuu di somara nait dem. Inna him blue gardens man an girls come an go like moths mongst di whisperings an di shampagne an di stars. At high tide inna di aftanoon mi watch him guests dem a dive fram di tower a him raft, or tek di sun pan di hot sand a him beach wile him two motorboats dem slit di waters a di Sound, a draw aquaplanes ova cataracts a foam. Pan weekends him Rolls-Royce did a become an omnibus, bearing parties to an from di city between nine inna di morning an long past midnight, while him station wagon did a scampere like a brisk yellow bug fi meet all trains. An pan Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day wid mops an scrubbing-brushes an hammers an garden-shears, repair di ravages of di night before.</p>
<p>Every Friday five crates a oranges an lemons arrive fram a fruiterer inna New York—every Monday dem same oranges an lemons lef him back door inna a pyramid a pulpless halves. Deh did have a machine inna di kitchen weh coulda extract di juice a two hundred oranges inna half an hour if a likkle button did press two hundred times wid a butler's thumb.</p>
<p>At least once a fortnight a corps a caterers come dung wid several hundred feet a canvas an enough colored lights fi mek a Christmas tree a Gatsby's enormous garden. Pan buffet tables, garnish wid glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads a harlequin designs an pastry pigs an turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. Inna di main hall a bar wid a real brass rail did set op, an did stock wid gins an liquors an wid cordials so long forget dat most a him female guests dem did too young fi know one fram anodda.</p>
<p>By seven o'clock di orchestra don arrive, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful a oboes an trombones an saxophones an viols an cornets an piccolos, an low an high drums. Di laas swima dem kom iin fram di biich nou an a jres opstierz; di cars dem fram New York park five deep inna di drive, an already di halls an salons an verandas dem gaudy wid primary colours, an hair bobbed inna strange new ways, an shawls beyond di dreams a Castile. Di bar deh inna full swing, an floating rounds a cocktails permeate di garden outside, until di air alive wid chatter an laughter, an casual innuendo an introductions forgetten pan di spot, an enthusiastic meetings between women who neva know each other's names.</p>
<p>Di lights dem grow brighter as di earth lurch weh fram di sun, an now di orchestra a play yellow cocktail music, an di opera a voices pitch a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled wid prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. Di groups dem change more swiftly, swell wid new arrivals, dissolve an form inna di same breath; already deh deh wanderers, confident girls weh weave yah an deh mongst di stouter an more stable, become fi a sharp, joyous moment di center a one group, an den, excited wid triumph, glide on thru di sea-change a faces an voices an color unda di constantly changing light.</p>
<p>Suddenly one a dem gypsies, inna trembling opal, seize a cocktail outa di air, dump it dung fi courage an, moving har han dem like Frisco, dance out alone pan di canvas platform. A momentary hush; di orchestra leader varie him rhythm obligingly fi har, an deh have a burst a chatter as di erroneous news go roun seh she a Gilda Gray's understudy fram di Follies. Di party don staat.</p>
<p>Mi believe seh pan di first night mi go a Gatsby's house mi was one a di few guests dem weh did actually get invite. Piipl neva get invait—dem go de. Dem get inna automobiles weh did a bore dem out to Long Island, an somehow dem did end up a Gatsby's door. Wen dem did deh deh dem did get introduce by somebody weh did know Gatsby, an afta dat dem did a conduct demself according to di rules a behavior weh did associate wid an amusement park. Somtaim dem come an go widout have meet Gatsby at all, come fi di party wid a simplicity a heart weh was it own ticket a admission.</p>
<p>Dem did actually invite mi. A chauffeur inna a uniform a robin's-egg blue cross mi lawn early dat deh Saturday maanin wid a surprisingly formal note fram him employer: di honor woulda be entirely Gatsby's, it seh, if mi woulda attend him “little party” dat deh night. Im did si mi plenty taim, an im did inten fi call pan mi lang bifuor, bot a peculiar kombinieshan a circumstances did prevent it—signed Jay Gatsby, inna wan majestic han.</p>
<p>Dress up inna white flannels mi go ova to him lawn a likkle afta seven, an wander roun rather ill at ease mongx swirls an eddies a people mi neva know—though yah an deh was a face mi did notice pan di commuting train. Mi did immediately strike by di numba a young Englishmen dem did dot bout; all well dressed, all look a likkle hungry, an all a talk inna low, earnest voices to solid an prosperous Americans. Mi did sure seh dem did a sell someting: bonds or insurance or automobiles. Dem did at least agonizingly aware a di easy money inna di vicinity an convince seh a dem own fi a few words inna di right key.</p>
<p>As soon as mi arrive mi mek an attempt fi find mi host, but di two or three people a whom mi ask him weh deh stare at mi in such an amazed way, an deny so vehemently any knowledge a him movements, dat mi slunk off inna di direction a di cocktail table—di only place inna di garden weh a single man coulda linger widout purpose an alone.</p>
<p>Mi did deh pan mi way fi get roaring drunk fram sheer embarrassment wen Jordan Baker come outa di house an stan up a di head a di marble steps, leaning a likkle backward an looking wid contemptuous interest dung inna di garden.</p>
<p>Welcome or not, mi find it necessary fi attach miself to somebody before mi shuda staat address cordial remarks to di passersby.</p>
<p>"Ello!" Mi roar, advancing toward har. Mi voice did look unnaturally loud across di garden.</p>
<p>“Mi did tink yuh mighta deh yah,” she ansa absently as mi come up. “Mi memba yuh did live next door to—”</p>
<p>Shi hold mi han impersonally, as a promise seh shi woulda tek kier a mi inna a minute, an gi ear to two girls inna twin yellow dresses, weh did stop a di foot a di steps.</p>
<p>"Ello!" dem baal tugeda. “Sorry yuh neva win.”</p>
<p>Dat was fi di golf tournament. Shi did lose inna di finals di week before.</p>
<p>“Yu no nuo uu wi bi,” wan a di gyal dem ina yelo se, “bot wi miit yu ya bout a mont abak.”</p>
<p>“Yuh don dye yuh hair since den,” Jordan seh, an mi staat, but di gyal dem did move casually on an har remark did address to di premature moon, weh did produce like di supper, no doubt, outa a caterer's basket. Wid Jordan's slender golden arm resting inna mine, we descended di steps an sauntered bout di garden. A tray a cocktails did a float pan wi chruu di twilight, an wi did sidong a wan tiebl wid di tuu gyal dem inna yelo an chrii man, evri wan a dem inchruoduus tu wi az Mr. Mumble.</p>
<p>“Yuh come to dem party yah often?” Jordan aks di gyal weh did deh beside har.</p>
<p>“Di laas wan a di wan mi miit yuh pan,” di gyal ansa, inna wan alert kanfident vais. Shi ton to har companion: “A neva fi yuh, Lucille?”</p>
<p>A did fi Lucille, too.</p>
<p>“Mi like fi come,” Lucille seh. “Mi neva care weh mi do, so mi always have a good time. Wen mi did deh yah last mi tier mi gown pan a chair, an him ask mi mi name an address—inside a week mi get a package fram Croirier's wid a new evening gown inna it.”</p>
<p>“Yuh did keep it?” Jordan aks.</p>
<p>“Sure mi did. Mi did a go wear it tonight, but it did too big inna di bust an did haffi be altered. It was gas blue wid lavender beads. Two hundred an sixty-five dollars.”</p>
<p>“A someting funny bout a fellow weh ago do a ting like dat,” di ada girl seh eagerly. “Im no waahn no chrobl wid <i>no</i> badi.”</p>
<p>“A who nuh?” Mi aks.</p>
<p>“Gatsby. Sombadi tell mi—”</p>
<p>Di two gyal dem an Jordan did a lean tugeda confidentially.</p>
<p>“Somebody tell mi seh dem did tink him did kill a man once.”</p>
<p>A thrill pass ova all a wi. Di three Mr. Mumbles dem ben forward an lisn eagerly.</p>
<p>“Mi no tink it so much <i>dat</i> ,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It's more dat him was a German spy during di war.”</p>
<p>One a di man dem nod inna confirmation.</p>
<p>“Mi hear dat fram a man weh did know all bout him, grow up wid him inna Germany,” him assured wi positively.</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” di fos gyal seh, “it couldn't be dat, cause him did deh inna di American army during di war.” As wi credulity switch back to har she lean forward wid enthusiasm. “Yu luk pan im somtaim wen im tingk nobadi naa luk pan im. Mi wi bet im kil wan man.”</p>
<p>Shi narrow har eyes an shiver. Lucille did a shiver. Wi all turn an look roun fi Gatsby. A did testimony to di romantic speculation weh him did inspire seh deh did have whispers bout him fram dem who did find likkle weh it did necessary fi whisper bout inna dis ya worl.</p>
<p>Di fos supper—dem woulda have anodda one afta midnight—dem did a serve now, an Jordan invite mi fi join har own party, who did spread roun a table pan di ada side a di garden. Deh did have three married couples an Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate weh did gi to violent innuendo, an obviously unda di impression seh sooner or later Jordan did a go yield him up har person to a greater or lesser degree. Insted a rambling, dis party did preserve a dignified homogeneity, an did assume to itself di function a represent di staid nobility a di countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg an carefully on guard against it spectroscopic gaiety.</p>
<p>“Mek wi get out,” Jordan whispered, afta a somehow wasteful an inappropriate half-hour; “dis is much too polite fi mi.”</p>
<p>Wi get up, an she explain seh wi did a go find di host: Mi neva meet him, she seh, an it did a mek mi uneasy. Di undergraduate nod inna a cynical, melancholy way.</p>
<p>Di bar, weh wi did look pan fos, did full a piipl, but Gatsby neva deh deh. Shi kudn fain im fram di tap a di step dem, an im neva de pan di veranda. Pan a chance wi try an important-looking door, an walk into a high Gothic library, paneled wid carved English oak, an probably transported complete fram some ruin overseas.</p>
<p>A stout, middle-aged man, wid enormous owl-eyed spectacles, did a sidong likkle drunk pan di edge a one great table, a stare wid unsteady concentration at di shelves a books. As we enter him wheel excitedly roun an examine Jordan fram head to foot.</p>
<p>“Weh yuh tink?” him demand impetuously.</p>
<p>“Bout weh?”</p>
<p>Im wave im han toward di bookshelf dem.</p>
<p>“Bout dat. As a matter a fact yuh needn't bada fi ascertain. Mi ascertain. Dem real.”</p>
<p>“Di books dem?”</p>
<p>Im nod.</p>
<p>“Absolutely real—have pages an everyting. Mi did tink dem woulda be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, dem absolutely real. Pages an—Here! Mek mi show yuh.”</p>
<p>Tek wi skepticism fi granted, him rush to di bookcases an come back wid Volume One a di <i>Stoddard Lectures</i> .</p>
<p>"Si!" him cry triumphantly. “A one bona-fide piece a printed matter. It fooled mi. Dis fella a one regular Belasco. A one triumph. Weh thoroughness! Weh realism! Knew wen fi stop, too—didn't cut di pages. But weh yuh waan? Weh yuh expect?”</p>
<p>Im snatch di book fram mi an put it hastily pan it shelf, an a mutter seh if dem tek weh one brick di whole library woulda collapse.</p>
<p>“A who bring yuh?” him demand. “Ar yuh jus come? Dem did bring mi. Most people did bring.”</p>
<p>Jordan look pan him alertly, cheerfully, widout ansa.</p>
<p>“Mi did get bring by a woman name Roosevelt,” him continue. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Yuh know har? Mi meet har somwe last night. Mi did drunk fi bout a week now, an mi did tink it might sober mi up fi sit inna a library.”</p>
<p>“It?”</p>
<p>“Likl bit, mi tingk. Mi kyaahn tel yet. Mi onggl de ya fi wan owa. Mi tel yu bout di buk dem? Dem riil. Dem a—”</p>
<p>“Yuh tell wi.”</p>
<p>Wi shake han wid him gravely an go back outdoors.</p>
<p>Dem did a dance now pan di canvas inna di garden; old man a push young girls backward inna eternal graceless circles, superior couples a hold each other tortuously, fashionably, an keeping inna di corners—an a great number a single girls a dance individually or relieving di orchestra fi a moment a di burden a di banjo or di traps. By midnight di hilarity did increase. A celebrated tenor did sing inna Italian, an a notorious contralto did sing inna jazz, an between di numba dem people did a do “stunts” all ova di garden, while happy, vacuous bursts a laughter did a rose toward di summer sky. A pair a stage twins, weh did turn out fi be di girls inna yellow, did a baby act inna costume, an dem did serve champagne inna glasses bigger dan finger-bowls. Di moon did rise higher, an floating inna di Sound was a triangle a silver scales, tremble likkle to di stiff, tinny drip a di banjoes dem pan di lawn.</p>
<p>Mi did still deh wid Jordan Baker. Wi did a sidong a wan tiebl wid wan man a bout mi iej an wan rowdy likl gyal, weh gi wie pan di liklis provokeshan tu uncontrollable laaf. Mi did a enjoy miself now. Mi did tek two finger-bowls a champagne, an di scene did change before mi eyes into someting significant, elemental, an profound.</p>
<p>At a lull inna di entertainment di man look pon mi an smile.</p>
<p>“Yuh face familiar,” him seh politely. “Yuh neva deh inna di First Division during di war?”</p>
<p>“Why yes. Mi did deh inna di Twenty-eighth Infantry.”</p>
<p>“Mi did deh inna di Sixteenth til June nineteen-eighteen. Mi did know seh mi did si yuh somwe before.”</p>
<p>Wi did a taak fi a moment bout some wet, gray likkle villages inna France. Evidently him did live inna dis vicinity, fi him tell mi seh him did jus buy a hydroplane, an him did a go try it out inna di morning.</p>
<p>“Yuh waan go wid mi, old sport? Jus near di shore along di Sound.”</p>
<p>“Weh time?”</p>
<p>“Any time dat suit yuh best.”</p>
<p>A did pan di tip a mi tongue fi ask him name wen Jordan look roun an smile.</p>
<p>“Yuh have a gay time now?” shi aks.</p>
<p>“Much better.” Mi turn again to mi new acquaintance. “Dis a one unusual party fi mi. Mi neva even si di host. Mi live ova deh—” Mi wave mi han at di invisible hedge inna di distance, “an dis man Gatsby sen ova him chauffeur wid an invitation.”</p>
<p>Fi a moment him look pan mi as if him fail fi andastan.</p>
<p>“Mi a Gatsby,” im se sodn.</p>
<p>"Wah!" Mi exclaim. “Oh, mi beg yuh pardon.”</p>
<p>“Mi did tink yuh did know, ole sport. Mi fraid mi a nuh very good host.”</p>
<p>Im smile understandingly—much more dan understandingly. A did one a dem rare smile wid a quality a eternal reassurance inna it, weh yuh may come across four or five times inna life. It face—or did look like it did a face—di whole eternal world fi a instant, an den concentrate pan <i>yuh</i> wid an irresistible prejudice inna yuh favour. It andastan yuh jus so far as yuh did waan fi get andastan, did believe inna yuh as yuh woulda like fi believe inna yuhself, an assured yuh seh it did have precisely di impression a yuh weh, at yuh best, yuh did a hope fi convey. Precisely at dat point it vanish—an mi did a look pon an elegant young roughneck, a year or two ova thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech jus miss being absurd. Some time before him introduce himself mi did get a strong impression seh him did a pick him words wid care.</p>
<p>Almost at di moment wen Mr. Gatsby did identify himself a butler hurry toward him wid di information seh Chicago did a call him pan di wire. Him excuse himself wid a likkle bow weh did include each a wi inna turn.</p>
<p>“If yuh waan anyting jus ask fi it, old sport,” him urge mi. “Excuse mi. Mi ago join yuh again later.”</p>
<p>Wen him did gaan mi turn immediately to Jordan—constrained fi assure har a mi surprise. Mi did expect seh Mr. Gatsby woulda be a florid an corpulent person inna him middle years.</p>
<p>“A who him is?” Mi did a demand. “Yuh know?”</p>
<p>“Im a jos wan man niem Gatsby.”</p>
<p>“A we im kom fram, an wa im du?”</p>
<p>“Now <i>yuh</i> staat pan di subject,” she ansa wid a wan smile. “Well, him tell mi once seh him a one Oxford man.”</p>
<p>A dim background staat tek shape behind him, but at har next remark it fade weh.</p>
<p>“However, mi nuh believe it.”</p>
<p>"Wah mek?"</p>
<p>“Mi nuh know,” she insist, “mi jus nuh tink him go deh.”</p>
<p>Somting inna har tone remind mi a di ada gyal “Mi tink him kill a man,” an did have di effect a stimulate mi curiosity. Mi woulda accept widout question di information seh Gatsby sprang fram di swamps a Louisiana or fram di lower East Side a New York. Dat was comprehensible. But young man neva—at least inna mi provincial inexperience mi did believe dem neva—drift coolly outa noweh an buy a palace pan Long Island Sound.</p>
<p>“Anyhow, him gi big parties,” Jordan seh, an change di subject wid a urban distaste fi di concrete. “An mi like big parties. Dem so intimate. At likkle parties nuh privacy nuh deh.”</p>
<p>Deh did a boom a one bass drum, an di voice a di orchestra leader ring out suddenly above di echolalia a di garden.</p>
<p>“Ladies an gentlemen,” him baal out. “At di request a Mr. Gatsby wi a go play fi yuh Mr. Vladmir Tostoff's latest work, weh did attract so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If yuh read di papers yuh know seh a did a big sensation.” Im smile wid jovial condescension, an added: “Some sensation!” Wen everybody did a laugh.</p>
<p>“Di piece is known,” him conclude lustily, “as 'Vladmir Tostoff's Jazz History of the World!' ”</p>
<p>Di nature a Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded mi, cause jus as it staat mi eyes dem fall pan Gatsby, standing alone pan di marble steps an looking fram one group to anodda wid approving eyes. Him tanned skin did draw attractively tight pan him face an him short hair did look like it did trim every day. Mi couldn't see notn sinister bout him. Mi did a wanda if di fact seh him neva did a drink did help fi set him off fram him guests, cause it did look like mi seh him did a grow more correct as di fraternal hilarity did a increase. Wen di “Jazz History of the World” did don, di girls dem did a put dem head pan di man dem shoulda inna a puppyish, convivial way, di girls dem did a swoon backward playfully inna di man dem arms, even inna groups, knowing seh somebody woulda arrest dem falls—but nobadi neva swoon backward pan Gatsby, an no French bob touch Gats shoulda dem, an no quarter did a sing wid quartets Gatsby head fi one link.</p>
<p>“Mi a beg yuh pardon.”</p>
<p>Gatsby's butler did suddenly stan up beside wi.</p>
<p>“Miss Baker?” him ask. “Mi beg yuh pardon, but Mr. Gatsby woulda like fi speak to yuh alone.”</p>
<p>“Wid mi?” shi exclaim inna surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>
<p>Shi get up slowly, raise har eyebrows at mi inna astonishment, an fala di butler toward di house. Mi notice seh she did a wear har evening-dress, all har dress, like sports clothes—deh did have a jauntiness bout har movements as if she did first learn fi walk upon golf courses pan clean, crisp mornings.</p>
<p>Mi did deh alone an it was almost two. Fi some time confused an intriguing sounds did a come fram a long, many-windowed room weh did a overhung di terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate, who did now engaged inna an obstetrical conversation wid two chorus girls, an who did a beg mi fi join him, mi go inside.</p>
<p>Di big ruum did ful op a piipl. One a di gyal dem inna yellow did a play di piano, an beside har did a stan op a tall, red-haired young lady fram a famous chorus, a did a song. Shi did drink a quantity a champagne, an during di course a har song shi did decide, ineptly, seh everyting did very, very sad—she neva only did a sing, she did a weeping too. Enitaim di song did a pause she did a full it wid gasping, broken sobs, an den tek up di lyric agen inna a quavering soprano. Di tears dem did a course dung har cheeks—not freely, however, fi wen dem did come inna contact wid har heavily beaded eyelashes dem did assume an inky colour, an pursue di rest a dem way inna slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion did mek seh shi fi sing di notes dem pan har face, weh she throw up har han dem, sink inna a chair, an go off inna a deep vinous sleep.</p>
<p>“She did have a fight wid a man weh seh him a har husband,” explain a girl at mi elbow.</p>
<p>Mi look roun. Most a di res a di uman dem did a fait wid man weh dem se a dem ozban. Even Jordan's party, di quartet fram East Egg, did rent asunder by dissension. One a di man dem did a talk wid curious intensity to a young actress, an him wife, afta shi did a try laugh bout di situation inna a dignified an indifferent way, shi break dung entirely an resort to flank attacks—at intervals she appear suddenly at him side like an angry diamond, an hissed: “Yuh promise!” inna him ear.</p>
<p>Di reluctance fi go home neva did confined to wayward man dem. Di hall did at present occupied by two deplorably sober man an dem highly indignant wives. Di wives dem did a sympathize wid each ada inna likkle raised voices.</p>
<p>“Enitaim im si mi a av wahn gud taim im waahn go a im yaad.”</p>
<p>“Neva hear notn so selfish inna mi life.”</p>
<p>“Wi aalwiez a di fos wan dem fi lef.”</p>
<p>“A so wi.”</p>
<p>“Well, wi almost di last tonight,” one a di man dem seh sheepishly. “Di orchestra lef half an hour ago.”</p>
<p>In spite a di wives's agreement seh such malevolence was beyond credibility, di dispute did end inna a short struggle, an both wives did get lift, kicking, into di night.</p>
<p>As mi did a wait fi mi hat inna di hall di door a di library open an Jordan Baker an Gatsby come out tugeda. Im did a seh some last word to har, but di eagerness inna im manner tighten abruptly into formality as several people approach him fi seh goodbye.</p>
<p>Jordan's party did a call har impatiently fram di porch, but she linger fi a moment fi shake hands.</p>
<p>“Mi jus hear di most amazing ting,” she whisper. “How long wi did deh deh?”</p>
<p>“Why, bout an hour.”</p>
<p>“It was... simply amazing,” she repeated abstractly. “But mi swore seh mi naa go tell it an yahso mi a tantalize yuh.” Shi yawn gracefully inna mi face. “Please come an see mi... Phone book... Under di name a Mrs. Sigourney Howard... Mi aunt...” Shi did a hurry off as she did a talk—har brown han did a wave a jaunty salute as she melt inna har party at di door.</p>
<p>Radda shame dat pan mi first appearance mi did stay so late, mi join di last a Gatsby's guests, weh did cluster roun him. Mi did waan explain seh mi did a hunt fi him early inna di evening an fi apologize fi neva know him inna di garden.</p>
<p>“No menshan it,” him enjoin mi eagerly. “No gi it noda tings, uol sport.” Di familiar expression neva have no more familiarity dan di han weh reassuringly brush mi shoulda. “An no figet wi a go op ina di haidroplan tumaro maanin, nain aklak.”</p>
<p>Den di butler, behind him shoulda:</p>
<p>“Philadelphia waan yuh pan di phone, sir.”</p>
<p>“Aal rait, ina wan minit. Tel dem se mi wi de rait de... Gud nait.”</p>
<p>"Gud nite."</p>
<p>"Gud nite." Im smile—an suddenly it did look like it did have a pleasant significance inna im did deh mongst di last fi go, as if im did waan it all di time. “Gud nait, uol sport... Gud nait.”</p>
<p>But as mi walk dung di steps mi si seh di evening neva quite ova. Fifty feet fram di door a dozen headlights did a illuminate a bizarre an tumultuous scene. Inna di ditch beside di road, right side up, but violently shorn a one wheel, rest a new coupé weh did lef Gatsby's drive not two minutes before. Di shaap jut a wan waal did mek di wiil get lef, weh did a get nof atenshan fram aaf a dozn kyarious chauffeurs. However, as dem did lef dem cars a block di road, a harsh, discordant din fram dem inna di rear did a audible fi some time, an did add to di already violent confusion a di scene.</p>
<p>A man inna a long duster did dismount fram di wreck an now did a stan up inna di middle a di road, a look fram di car to di tire an fram di tire to di observers inna a pleasant, puzzled way.</p>
<p>"Si!" him explain. “It go inna di ditch.”</p>
<p>Di fact was infinitely astonishing to him, an mi recognize first di unusual quality a wonder, an den di man—it was di late patron a Gatsby's library.</p>
<p>“How it happen?”</p>
<p>Im shrug im shoulda dem.</p>
<p>“Mi no know notn bout mechanics,” him seh decisively.</p>
<p>“Bot ou kom it apm? Yu ron go iina di waal?”</p>
<p>“No ask mi,” Owl Eyes seh, a wash him han dem a di whole mata. “Mi know very likkle bout driving—next to nutten. It happen, an a dat mi know.”</p>
<p>“Well, if yuh a poor driver yuh shudn't try drive at night.”</p>
<p>“But mi neva did a even try,” him explain indignantly, “mi neva did a even try.”</p>
<p>An awed hush did fall pan di bystanders.</p>
<p>“Yuh waan commit suicide?”</p>
<p>“Yuh lucky it was jus a wheel!A bad driver an not even <i>try</i> ing!”</p>
<p>“Yuh nuh andastan,” di criminal explain. “Mi neva did a jraiv. A wan neda man de inna di kyaar.”</p>
<p>Di shock weh did a follow dis declaration did find voice inna a sustained “Ah-hh!” as di door a di coupé swing slowly open. Di crowd—it was now a crowd—step back involuntarily, an wen di door did open wide deh did have a ghostly pause. Den, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual step outa di wreck, pawing tentatively at di ground wid a large uncertain dancing shoe.</p>
<p>Blinded by di glare a di headlights an confused by di incessant groaning a di horns, di apparition did a stan op a sway fi a moment before him si di man inna di duster.</p>
<p>“Weh mata?” him ask calmly. “Wi did run outa gas?”</p>
<p>"Luk!"</p>
<p>Half a dozen fingers pointed at di amputated wheel—im stare at it fi a moment, an den look upward as if im did tink seh it did drop fram di sky.</p>
<p>“It come off,” somebody explain.</p>
<p>Im nod.</p>
<p>“At fos mi neva notice seh wi did stop.”</p>
<p>A pause. Den, tek a lang breath an straighten him shoulda dem, him remark inna a determined voice:</p>
<p>“Wonder'ff tell mi weh deh a gas'line station?”</p>
<p>At least a dozen man, some a dem a likkle beta off dan him did, explain to him seh wheel an car neva did a join wid no physical bond no more.</p>
<p>“Back out,” him suggest afta a moment. “Put har inna reverse.”</p>
<p>“But di <i>wheel</i> off!”</p>
<p>Im did a hesitate.</p>
<p>“No harm inna trying,” him seh.</p>
<p>Di caterwauling horns dem did reach a crescendo an mi turn weh an cut across di lawn toward home. Mi look back once. A wafer a one moon did a shine ova Gatsby's house, mek di night fine as before, an survive di laughter an di sound a him still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness did a flow now fram di windows an di great doors, endowing wid complete isolation di figure a di host, weh did a stan op pan di porch, him han op inna a formal gesture a farewell.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Wen mi read ova weh mi write so far, mi see seh mi gi di impression seh di events a three nights several weeks apart was all weh absorb mi. Pan di contrary, dem was merely casual events inna a crowded summer, an, until much later, dem absorb mi infinitely less dan mi personal affairs.</p>
<p>Most a di time mi did a work. Inna di early morning di sun throw mi shadow westward as mi hurry dung di white chasms a lower New York to di Probity Trust. Mi did know di ada clerks an di young bond-salesmen dem by dem first name, an mi did a lunch wid dem inna dark, crowded restaurants pan likkle pig sausages an mashed potatoes an coffee. Mi even did have a short affair wid a girl weh did live inna Jersey City an did a work inna di accounting department, but har bredda staat throw mean looks inna mi direction, so wen she go pan har vacation inna July mi mek it blow quietly weh.</p>
<p>Mi tek dinner usually a di Yale Club—fi some reason it was di gloomiest event a mi day—an den mi go upstairs to di library an study investments an securities fi a concientious hour. Dem did have a few rioters roun, but dem neva come inna di library, so it was a good place fi work. Afta dat, if di nait did mellow, mi stroll dong Madison Avenue past di uol Murray Hill Hotel, an uova 33rd Street tu di Pennsylvania Station.</p>
<p>Mi staat fi like New York, di racy, adventurous feel a it at night, an di satisfaction weh di constant flicker a man an woman an machine dem gi di restless eye. Mi did like fi walk up Fifth Avenue an pick out romantic women fram di crowd an imagine seh inna a few minutes mi did a go enter inna dem life, an nobadi woulda eva know or disapprove. Somtaim, inna mi main, mi did a fala dem go a dem apartment pan di kona dem a di hidden street dem, an dem ton roun an smile bak tu mi bifuo dem fade chuu wan duor inna waam daaknis. At di enchanted metropolitan twilight mi did feel a haunting loneliness sometimes, an mi did feel it inna others—poor young clerks weh did a loiter in front a windows a wait until it was time fi a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks inna di dusk, a waste di most poignant moments a night an life.</p>
<p>Again at eight o'clock, wen di dark lanes a di Forties did line five deep wid throbbing taxicabs, bound fi di theatre district, mi feel a sinking inna mi heart. Forms did a lean tugeda inna di taksi dem as dem did a wait, an voices did a sing, an deh did a laugh fram unheard jokes, an lighted cigarettes mek unintelligible circles inside. Imagining seh mi, too, did a hurry towards gaiety an a share dem intimate excitement, mi wish dem well.</p>
<p>Fi a while mi lost sight a Jordan Baker, an den inna midsummer mi find har again. At first mi did flattered fi go places wid har, cause she was a golf champion, an everybody did know har name. Den it was someting more. Mi neva actually inna love, but mi did feel a sort a tender curiosity. Di bored haughty face weh she turn to di worl did a conceal someting—most affectations conceal someting eventually, even though dem nuh inna di beginning—an one day mi find weh it was. Wen wi did deh pan a house-party tugeda up inna Warwick, she lef a borrowed car out inna di rain wid di top dung, an den lie bout it—an suddenly mi memba di story bout har weh did elude mi dat deh night at Daisy's. At har first big golf tournament deh did have a row weh nearly reach di newspapers—a suggestion seh she did move har ball fram a bad lie inna di semifinal round. Di ting approach di proportions a one scandal—den dead weh. A caddie retract him statement, an di only ada witness admit seh him mighta did mistaken. Di incident an di name did remain tugeda inna mi mind.</p>
<p>Jordan Baker instinctively avoid clever, shrewd man, an now mi si seh dis was because she did feel safer pan a plane weh any divergence fram a code woulda be thought impossible. Shi did incurably dishonest. Shi neva able fi endure being at a disadvantage an, given dis unwillingness, mi suppose she did staat deal inna subterfuges wen she did very young fi keep dat deh cool, insolent smile turned to di world an yet satisfy di demands a har hard, jaunty body.</p>
<p>It neva mek no difference to mi. Dishonesty inna a woman a one ting yuh neva blame deeply—mi did casually sorry, an den mi forget. A pan dat deh same house-party deh we did have a curious conversation bout driven a car. It staat cause she pass so close to some workman dat wi fender flick a button pan one man's coat.</p>
<p>“Yu a ratn jraiva,” mi protes. “Either yuh fi be more careful, or yuh fi nuh drive at all.”</p>
<p>“Mi careful.”</p>
<p>“No, yuh nuh.”</p>
<p>“Well, ada people deh,” she seh lightly.</p>
<p>“Weh dat have fi duh wid it?”</p>
<p>“Dem ago kip outa mi wie,” shi insis. “It tek two fi mek an accident.”</p>
<p>“Suppose yuh meet somebody jus as careless as yuhself.”</p>
<p>“Mi hope mi neva ago,” she ansa. “Mi hate careless people. A dat mek mi like yuh.”</p>
<p>Har grey, sun-strained eyes dem did a stare straight ahead, but she did deliberately shift wi relations, an fi a moment mi did tink seh mi did love har. But mi a slow-thinking an full a interior rules weh act as brakes pan mi desires, an mi did know seh fos mi did haffi get miself definitely outa dat deh tangle back home. Mi did a write letta once a week an sign dem: “Love, Nick,” an all mi coulda tink bout was how, wen dat deh certain girl did a play tennis, a faint mustache a perspiration did a appear pan har upper lip. Nevertheless deh did have a vague understanding weh did haffi be tactfully broken off before mi did free.</p>
<p>Everybody suspect demself a at least one a di cardinal virtues, an dis a mine: Mi a one a di few honest people weh mi eva know.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<p>Pan Sunday maanin wile church bells did a ring inna di villages dem alongshore, di worl an it mistress did go back to Gatsby's house an twinkle hilariously pan him lawn.</p>
<p>“Im a bootlegger,” di young ladies dem seh, a move somwe between him cocktails an him flowers. “One time him kill a man weh did find out seh him was nephew to Von Hindenburg an second cousin to di devil. Reach mi a rose, honey, an pour mi a last drop inna dat deh crystal glass.”</p>
<p>Wan taim mi did rait dong pan di emti spies dem a wahn taimtebl di niem a dem we did kom a Gatsby yaad dat de soma. A one old timetable now, disintegrating at its folds, an headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.” But mi can still read di grey names dem, an dem ago gi yuh a betta impression dan mi generalities a dem who accept Gatsby's hospitality an pay him di subtle tribute a knowing nutten whatever bout him.</p>
<p>Fram East Egg, den, did come di Chester Beckers an di Leeches, an a man name Bunsen, weh mi did know at Yale, an Doctor Webster Civet, weh did drown last summer up inna Maine. An di Hornbeams an di Willie Voltaires, an a whole clan name Blackbuck, weh always gather inna one corner an flip up dem nose like goats at whoseeva come near. An di Ismays an di Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach an Mr. Chrystie's wife), an Edgar Beaver, whose hair, dem seh, did turn cotton-white one winta aftanuun fi no good reason at all.</p>
<p>Clarence Endive was fram East Egg, as mi memba. Im did come only once, inna white knickerbockers, an did a fight wid a bum name Etty inna di garden. Fram farther out pan di Island come di Cheadles an di ORP Schraeders, an di Stonewall Jackson Abrams a Georgia, an di Fishguards an di Ripley Snells. Snell did deh deh three days before him go a di penitentiary, so drunk out pan di gravel drive dat Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile run ova him right han. Di Dancies dem come, too, an SB Whitebait, weh did well ova sixty, an Maurice A. Flink, an di Hammerheads, an Beluga di tobacco importer, an Beluga's girls.</p>
<p>Fram West Egg did come di Poles an di Mulreadys an Cecil Roebuck an Cecil Schoen an Gulick di State senator an Newton Orchid, weh did a control Films Par Excellence, an Eckhaust an Clyde Cohen an Don S. Schwartz (di son) an Arthur McCarty, all a dem did connect wid di movies inna one way or di ada. An di Catlips an di Bembergs an G. Earl Muldoon, bredda to dat deh Muldoon weh aftaward strangle him wife. Da Fontano di promoter come deh, an Ed Legros an James B. (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret an di De Jongs an Ernest Lilly—dem come fi gamble, an wen Ferret wander inna di garden it mean seh him did clean out an Associated Traction woulda haffi fluctuate profitably next day.</p>
<p>A man name Klipspringer did deh deh so often dat dem did call him “di boarder”—mi doubt if him did have no ada yaad. Outa di theatrical people dem did have Gus Waize an Horace O'Donavan an Lester Myer an George Duckweed an Francis Bull. Also fram New York was di Chromes an di Backhyssons an di Dennickers an Russel Betty an di Corrigans an di Kellehers an di Dewars an di Scullys an SW Belcher an di Smirkes an di young Quinns, divorced now, an Henry L. Palmetto, weh kill himself wen him jump in front a one subway train inna Square Times.</p>
<p>Benny McClenahan did arrive always wid four girls. Dem neva did quite di same ones inna physical person, but dem did so identical one wid anodda dat it inevitably did look like dem did deh deh before. Mi forget dem name—Jaqueline, mi tink, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, an dem last names was either di melodious names a flowers an months or di sterner ones a di great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, dem woulda confess demself to be.</p>
<p>In addition to all dem mi can memba seh Faustina O'Brien did come deh at least once an di Baedeker gyal dem an di young Brewer, weh did get him nose shot off inna di war, an Mr. Albrucksburger an Miss Haag, him fiancée, an Ardita Fitz-Peters an Mr. P. Jewett, once head a di American Legion, an Miss Hiudia, did get reput wid har man chauffeur, an a prince a someting, weh wi did call Duke, an whose name, if mi eva know it, mi forget.</p>
<p>Di uol a dem de piipl did kom a Gatsby yaad ina di soma.</p>
<hr/>
<p>At nine o'clock, one morning late inna July, Gatsby's gorgeous car lurch up di rocky drive to mi door an gi out a burst a melody fram it three-noted horn.</p>
<p>A did di first time him did call pan mi, though mi did go a two a him parties, mount inna him hydroplane, an, at him urgent invitation, mek frequent use a him beach.</p>
<p>“Gud maanin, uol spot. Yu a iit lunch wid mi tide an mi did tingk se wi uda riid op tugeda.”</p>
<p>Im did a balance imself pan di dashboard a im car wid dat deh resourcefulness a movement weh so peculiarly American—dat come, mi suppose, wid di absence a lifting work inna youth an, even more, wid di formless grace a wi nervous, sporadic games. Dis quality did a continually break through him punctilious manner inna di shape a restlessness. Him neva quite still; deh did always have a tapping foot somewhere or di impatient opening an closing a one han.</p>
<p>Im si mi a look wid admiration pan im car.</p>
<p>“It priti, no chruu, uol spot?” Him jump off fi gi mi a betta view. “Yuh neva si it before?”</p>
<p>Mi did si it. Everybody did see it. It was a rich cream colour, bright wid nickel, swollen yah an deh inna it monstrous length wid triumphant hatboxes an supper-boxes an toolboxes, an terrace wid a labyrinth a windshields weh mirror a dozen suns. Sitting dung behind many layers a glass inna a sort a green leather conservatory, we staat to town.</p>
<p>Mi did taak wid him perhaps half a dozen times inna di past month an find out, to mi disappointment, seh him did have likkle fi seh. So mi first impression, seh him was a person wid some undefined consequence, did gradually fade an him did become simply di proprietor a one elaborate roadhouse next door.</p>
<p>An den come dat disconcerting ride. Wi neva reach West Egg village before Gatsby staat lef him elegant sentence dem unfinished an slap himself indecisively pan di knee a him caramel-coloured suit.</p>
<p>“Look yah, ole sport,” him break out surprisingly, “weh yuh tink bout mi, anyhow?”</p>
<p>A likkle overwhelmed, mi staat di generalized evasions weh dat deh kweschan deserve.</p>
<p>“Wel, mi a go tel yu sopm bout mi laif,” im intarap. “Mi no waahn unu get no rang aidiya bout mi fram aal a dem tuori ya we unu ier.”</p>
<p>So him did aware a di bizarre accusations dem weh did a flavor conversation inna him halls.</p>
<p>“Mi wi tel yu Gad chuut.” Him right han suddenly order divine retribution fi stan by. “Mi a di son a some rich people inna di Middle West—all dead now. Mi did grow up inna America but mi did educate a Oxford, cause all mi ancestors dem did educate deh fi nuff years. A one family tradition.”</p>
<p>Im look pon mi sideways—an mi know why Jordan Baker did believe seh im did a lie. Im hurry di phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallow it, or choke pan it, as if it did bother him before. An wid dis doubt, him whole statement fall to pieces, an mi did a wanda if deh neva have someting likkle sinister bout him, afta all.</p>
<p>“Weh part a di Middle West?” Mi aks casually.</p>
<p>“San Francisco.”</p>
<p>"Mi si."</p>
<p>“Mi family all dead an mi come inna a good deal a money.”</p>
<p>Him voice did solemn, as if di memory a dat deh sudden extinction a one clan did still haunt him. Fi a moment mi did tink seh him did a pul mi leg, but a glance at him convince mi otherwise.</p>
<p>“Afta dat mi did live like a young rajah inna all di capitals a Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—a collect jewels, chiefly rubies, a hunt big game, a painting a likkle, tings fi miself only, an a try figet someting very sad weh did happen to mi long time ago.”</p>
<p>Wid an effort mi manage fi restrain mi incredulous laughter. Di very phrases dem did wear so threadbare dat dem neva evoke no image except dat a one turbaned “character” weh did a leak sawdust at every pore as him did a pursue a tiger thru di Bois de Boulogne.</p>
<p>“Den di war come, old sport. It was a great relief, an mi did try very hard fi dead, but mi did look like mi did a bear an enchanted life. Mi did accept a commission as first lieutenant wen it did staat. Inna di Argonne Forest mi tek di remains a mi machine-gun battalion so far forward dat deh did have a half mile gap pan either side a we di infantry dem couldn't advance. stay deh two days an two nights, a hundred an thirty man wid sixteen Lewis guns, an wen di infantry come up at last dem find di insignia a three German divisions mongst di piles a dead mi did get promote fi be a major, an every Allied government gi mi a decoration—even Montenegro, likkle Montenegroatic dung pan di Seriatic!”</p>
<p>Little Montenegro! Im lift op di wod dem an nod at dem—wid im smile. Di smile comprehend Montenegro's troubled history an sympathize wid di brave struggles a di Montenegrin people. It appreciate fully di chain a national circumstances weh did elicit dis tribute fram Montenegro's warm likkle heart. Mi incredulity did submerged inna fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.</p>
<p>Im reach inna im pocket, an a piece a metal, slung pan a ribbon, fall inna mi palm.</p>
<p>“A dat deh fram Montenegro.”</p>
<p>To mi astonishment, di ting did have a authentic look. “Orderi di Danilo,” run di circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”</p>
<p>“Turn it.”</p>
<p>“Major Jay Gatsby,” mi read, “For Valor Extraordinary.”</p>
<p>“Yahso a wan neda ting mi aalwiez kyari. A suvenir a Oxford days. Dem tek it inna Trinity Quad—di man pan mi lef a di Earl a Doncaster now.”</p>
<p>A did a photograph a half a dozen young man inna blazers a loaf inna one archway weh yuh did a si a host a spires. Gatsby did deh deh, looking a likkle, not much, younger—wid a cricket bat inna him han.</p>
<p>Den it did all true. Mi si di skin dem a di tigers dem a flai inna him palace pan di Grand Canal; Mi si him a open a chest a rubies fi ease, wid dem crimson-lighted depths, di gnawings a him broken heart.</p>
<p>“Mi a go mek a big request a yuh today,” im seh, an a pocket im suvenir dem wid satisfaction, “so mi did tink yuh shuda know someting bout mi. Mi neva waan yuh fi tink seh mi a jus some nobody. Yuh si, mi usually find miself mongst strangers cause mi drift yah an deh a try figet di sad tings dem weh happen to mi.” Im did a hesitate. “Yuh ago hear bout it dis aftanuun.”</p>
<p>“A lunch?”</p>
<p>“Nuo, dis aftanuun. Mi happen fi fain out se yu a tek Mis Beka fi tii.”</p>
<p>“Yu miin se yu lov Mis Baker?”</p>
<p>“No, old sport, mi nuh. But Miss Baker kindly consent fi talk to yuh bout dis matter.”</p>
<p>Mi neva have di faintest idea weh “dis matter” was, but mi did more annoyed dan interested. Mi neva did ask Jordan fi tea tea in order fi discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. Mi did sure di request woulda be someting utterly fantastic, an fi a moment mi did sorry mi did eva set foot pan him overpopulated lawn.</p>
<p>Im wudn se no ada wod. Him correctness grow pan him as wi did a near di city. Wi pass Port Roosevelt, weh yuh did have a glimpse a red-belted oceangoing ships, an sped along a cobbled slum weh did line wid di dark, undeserted saloons a di faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Den di valley a ashes open out pan both sides a wi, an mi did have a glimpse a Mrs. Wilson a strain at di garage pump wid panting vitality as we did a go by.</p>
<p>Wid fenders spread like wings wi scatter light thru half Astoria—only half, fi as we twist mongst di pillars a di elevated mi hear di familiar “jug-jug- <i>spat</i> !” a one motorcycle, an a frantic policeman did a drive alongside.</p>
<p>“All right, old sport,” Gatsby call. Wi slow dung. Im tek a wait card fram im wallet, an wave it infronta di man yai dem.</p>
<p>“Right yuh deh,” di policeman agree, tipping him cap. “Know yuh next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse <i>mi</i> !”</p>
<p>“Weh dat was?” Mi aks. “Di picture a Oxford?”</p>
<p>“Mi coulda do di commissioner a favor once, an him send mi a Christmas card every year.”</p>
<p>Ova di great bridge, wid di sunlight thru di girders dem a mek a constant flicker pan di cars dem weh a move, wid di city a rise up across di river inna white heaps an sugar lumps all build wid a wish out a nonolfactory money. Di city weh yuh si fram di Queensboro Bridge a always di city weh yuh si fi di first time, inna it first wild promise a all di mystery an di beauty inna di worl.</p>
<p>A dead man pass wi inna a hearse heaped wid blooms, followed by two carriages wid drawn blinds, an by more cheerful carriages fi frens. Di fren dem look out pan wi wid di tragic eyes an short upper lips a southeastern Europe, an mi did glad seh di sight a Gatsby's splendid car did include inna dem sombre holiday. As wi did a cross Blackwell's Island a limousine did a pass wi, weh did a drive by a white chauffeur, inna which did a did three modish negroes, two bucks an a girl. Mi laugh loud as di yolks a dem eyeballs roll toward wi inna haughty rivalry.</p>
<p>“Anyting can happen now dat we slid ova dis bridge,” mi tink; “anyting at all…”</p>
<p>Even Gatsby coulda happen, widout any particular wonder.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Roaring noon. Inna one well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar mi meet Gatsby fi lunch. Blinking weh di brightness a di street outside, mi eyes dem pick him out obscurely inna di anteroom, a talk to anodda man.</p>
<p>“Mr. Carraway, dis a mi fren Mr. Wolfshiem.”</p>
<p>A likkle, flat-nosed Jew raise him big head an look pan mi wid two fine growths a hair weh did a luxuriate inna either nostril. Afta a moment mi discover him tiny eyes inna di half-darkness.</p>
<p>“—So mi tek one look pon him,” seh Mr. Wolfshiem, a shake mi han earnestly, “an weh yuh tink mi did do?”</p>
<p>"Wah?" Mi aks politely.</p>
<p>But evidently him neva did a address mi, fi him drop mi han an cover Gatsby wid him expressive nose.</p>
<p>“Mi gi di money to Katspaugh an mi seh: 'All right, Katspaugh, nuh pay him a penny til him shet him mout.' Him shut it den an deh.”</p>
<p>Gatsby tek wan arm a each a wi an move forward inna di restaurant, wehpan Mr. Wolfshiem swallow a new sentence weh him did a staat an lapse inna a somnambulatory abstraction.</p>
<p>“Highballs?” di head waiter ask.</p>
<p>“Dis a one nice restaurant yah,” seh Mr. Wolfshiem, a look pan di presbyterian nymphs dem pan di ceiling. “But mi like across di street better!”</p>
<p>“Yes, highballs,” Gatsby agree, an den to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It too hot ova deh.”</p>
<p>“Hot an small—yes,” seh Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full a memories.”</p>
<p>“Weh place dat deh?” Mi ask.</p>
<p>“Di uol Metropole.”</p>
<p>“Di uol Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Fil op wid fies ded an gaan. Fuul op wid fren dem gaan nou fi eva. Mi kyaahn figet so lang az mi liv di nait dem shot Rosy Rosenthal de. A did siks a wi a di tiebl, an Rosy did iit an jringk nof aal iivnin. Wen it did aalmuos maanin di wait man kom op tu im wid wahn fani luk an se sombadi waahn taak outsaid rait, ‘A. seh Rosy, an staat get up, an mi pull him dung inna him chair.</p>
<p>“ 'Mek di bastard dem come in yah if dem waan yuh, Rosy, but don't yuh, so help mi, move outside dis room.'</p>
<p>“A did four o'clock inna di morning den, an if we did a raise di blinds wi woulda see daylight.”</p>
<p>“Im go?” Mi ask innocently.</p>
<p>“Sure him go.” Mr. Wolfshiem nose flash at mi indignantly. “Im ton roun inna di door an seh: 'No mek dat deh waiter tek weh mi coffee!' Den im go out pan di saidwie, an dem shuut im chrii taim iina im ful beli an jraiv we.”</p>
<p>“Four a dem get electrocuted,” mi seh, a memba.</p>
<p>“Five, wid Becker.” Him nostrils turn to mi inna an interested way. “Mi andastan seh yuh a look fi a business gonnegtion.”</p>
<p>Di juxtaposition a dem two remarks yah was startling. Gatsby ansa fi mi:</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” him seh, “dis a nuh di man.”</p>
<p>"No?" Mr. Wolfshiem did look disappointed.</p>
<p>“Dis a jus a fren. Mi did tell yuh seh wi woulda talk bout dat some other time.”</p>
<p>“Mi beg yuh pardon,” seh Mr. Wolfshiem, “mi did have a wrong man.”</p>
<p>A succulent hash arrive, an Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting di more sentimental atmosphere a di old Metropole, staat eat wid ferocious delicacy. Him eyes, meanwhile, did a rove very slowly all roun di room—im complete di arc by turning fi inspect di people dem weh did deh directly behind. Mi tink seh, except fi mi presence, him woulda tek one short glance unda wi own table.</p>
<p>“Luk ya so, uol spuots,” Gatsby se, a liin tuwaadz mi, “mi fried mi mek yu beks likl dis maanin ina di kyaar.”</p>
<p>Di smile did deh again, but dis time mi hold out against it.</p>
<p>“Mi no laik mistiek,” mi ansa, “an mi no andastan wa mek yu naa kom out frank an tel mi we yu waahn. Wa mek it aal afi kom chuu Mis Baker?”</p>
<p>“Oh, a nuh nutten undahand,” him assured mi. “Miss Baker a one great sportswoman, yuh know, an she woulda neva do notn weh neva all right.”</p>
<p>Suddenly him look pan him watch, jump up, an hurry fram di room, lef mi wid Mr. Wolfshiem a di table.</p>
<p>“Im haffi telephone,” seh Mr. Wolfshiem, a fala im wid im yai dem. “Fine fellow, noh true? Handsome fi look at an a perfect gentleman.”</p>
<p>"Yea."</p>
<p>“Im a one Oggsford man.”</p>
<p>"Awo!"</p>
<p>“Im go a Oggsford College inna England. Yuh know Oggsford College?”</p>
<p>“Mi hear bout it.”</p>
<p>“A one a di most famous college dem inna di worl.”</p>
<p>“Yuh know Gatsby fi a long time?” Mi aks.</p>
<p>“Several years,” him ansa inna a gratified way. “Mi mek di pleasure a him acquaintance jus afta di war. But mi did know seh mi did discover a man a fine breeding afta mi talk wid him an hour. Mi seh to miself: 'A di kain a man yuh woulda like fi tek home an introduce to yuh mada an sista.' ” Im pause. “Mi si yuh a look pon mi cuff buttons.”</p>
<p>Mi neva did a look pan dem, but mi did now. Dem did mek outa oddly familiar pieces a ivory.</p>
<p>“Finest specimens a human molars,” him tell mi.</p>
<p>"Well!" Mi inspect dem. “Dat a one very interesting idea.”</p>
<p>"Mhm." Him flip him sleeves up unda him coat. “Yeah, Gatsby very careful bout women. Him woulda neva so much as look pon a fren's wife.”</p>
<p>Wen di subject a dis instinctive trust return to di table an sidong Mr. Wolfshiem drink him coffee wid a jerk an get up him foot dem.</p>
<p>“Mi did enjoy mi lunch,” him seh, “an mi a go run weh fram unu two young man dem before mi outstay mi welcome.”</p>
<p>“Noh hurry Meyer,” Gatsby seh, widout enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raise him han inna a sort a benediction.</p>
<p>“Yuh very polite, but mi belong to anodda generation,” him announce solemnly. “Yuh sit yah an discuss yuh sports an yuh young ladies an yuh—” Im supply an imaginary noun wid anodda wave a im han. “Az fi mi, mi fifti ier uol, an mi naa go put miself pan yu no langga.”</p>
<p>As him did a shake him han dem an turn weh him tragic nose did a tremble. Mi did a wanda if mi did se notn fi ofen im.</p>
<p>“Im become very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “Dis a one a him sentimental days. Im a quite a character roun New York—a denizen a Broadway.”</p>
<p>“A who him is, anyhow, an actor?”</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>“A dentist?”</p>
<p>“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, him a one gambler.” Gatsby hesitate, den added, coolly: “Im a di man weh fix di World's Series back inna 1919.”</p>
<p>“Fixed di World's Series?” Mi repeat.</p>
<p>Di idea stagger mi. Mi memba, a course, seh di World's Series did fix inna 1919, but if mi did tink bout it at all mi woulda tink bout it as a ting weh merely <i>happen</i> , di end a some inevitable chain. It neva come to mi seh one man coulda staat play wid di faith a fifty million people—wid di single-mindedness a one burglar a blow a safe.</p>
<p>“How him happen fi do dat?” Mi ask afta a minute.</p>
<p>“Im jus si di opportunity.”</p>
<p>“Wa mek im no iina prizn?”</p>
<p>“Dem kyaahn get im, uol spuots.Im a smadi we smadi nuo.”</p>
<p>Mi insist fi pay di check. As di waiter did a bring mi change mi ketch sight a Tom Buchanan across di crowded room.</p>
<p>“Come wid mi fi a minute,” mi seh; “Mi haffi seh hello to somebody.”</p>
<p>Wen him see wi Tom jump up an tek half a dozen steps inna wi direction.</p>
<p>“Weh yuh did deh?” him demand eagerly. “Daisy furious cause yuh neva call up.”</p>
<p>“Dis a Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”</p>
<p>Dem shake dem han briefly, an a strained, unfamiliar look a embarrassment come ova Gatsby's face.</p>
<p>“How yuh been, anyhow?” Tom demand a mi. “How yuh happen fi come up so far fi eat?”</p>
<p>“Mi did a nyam lunch wid Mr. Gatsby.”</p>
<p>Mi turn toward Mr. Gatsby, but him neva deh deh no more.</p>
<hr/>
<p>One October day inna nineteen-seventeen—</p>
<p>(se Jordan Baker dat deh aftanoon, sitting up very straight pan a straight chair inna di tea-garden at di Plaza Hotel)</p>
<p>—Mi did a walk along fram one place to anodda, half pan di sidewalks an half pan di lawns. Mi did happy pan di lawns cause mi did have on shoes fram England wid rubber knobs pan di soles weh bit inna di soft ground. Mi did have on a new plaid skirt weh did a blow a likkle inna di wind, an weneva dis happen di red, white, an blue banners dem inna front a all di house dem did a stretch out stiff an seh <i>tut-tut-tut-tut</i> , inna a disapproving way.</p>
<p>Di biggis a di baana dem an di biggis a di lan dem did bilang tu Daisy Fay yaad. Shi did jus eighteen, two years older dan mi, an by far di most popular a all di young gyal dem inna Louisville. Shi did dress inna white, an did have a likkle white roadster, an all day long di telephone ring inna har house an excited young officers fram Camp Taylor did a demand di privilege fi monopolize har dat deh night. “Eniwie, fi wan owa!”</p>
<p>Wen mi come opposite har yaad da maanin deh har white roadster did deh beside di kerb, an she did a sidong inna it wid a lieutenant weh mi neva si before. Dem did so engrossed inna each ada dat she neva see mi until mi did deh five feet weh.</p>
<p>“Hello, Jordan,” she call unexpectedly. “Please come yah.”</p>
<p>Mi did flatter seh she did waan taak to mi, cause a all di older girls dem mi did admire har most. Shi aks mi if mi a go a di Red Kros fi mek banz. Mi did a. Wel, den, mi wuda tel dem se shi kudn kom da die de? Di officer look pon Daisy wile she did a talk, inna a way weh every young girl waan fi be look pon sometime, an cause it did look romantic to mi mi memba di incident ever since. Him name was Jay Gatsby, an mi neva lay eyes pan him again fi ova four years—even afta mi did meet him pan Long Island mi neva realize seh a di same man.</p>
<p>Dat was nineteen-seventeen. By di neks year mi did have a few beaux miself, an mi staat play inna tournaments, so mi neva see Daisy very often. Shi did go wid a likkle older crowd—wen shi did go wid anyone at all. Wild rumors did a circulate bout har—how har mada did find har a pack har bag one winta night fi go a New York an seh goodbye to a soldier weh did a go overseas. Shi did effectually prevent, but she neva did a taak wid har family fi several weeks. Afta dat shi neva play roun wid di soldiers dem no more, but only wid a few flat-footed, shortsighted young man dem inna town, weh couldn't get inna di army at all.</p>
<p>By di next autumn she did gay again, gay as ever. Shi did have a début afta di armistice, an inna February she did presumably engaged to a man fram New Orleans. Inna June she married Tom Buchanan a Chicago, wid more pomp an circumstance dan Louisville eva know before. Im come dung wid a hundred people inna four private cars, an hire a whole floor a di Muhlbach Hotel, an di day before di wedding im gi har a string a pearls weh value at three hundred an fifty thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Mi was a bridesmaid. Mi come inna har room half an hour before di bridal dinner, an find har lidong pan har bed as lovely as di June night inna har flowered dress—an as drunk as a monkey. Shi did have a bottle a Sauterne inna one han an a letta inna di nex one.</p>
<p>“ 'Gratulate mi,” she muttered. “Neva drink a drink before, but oh how mi do enjoy it.”</p>
<p>“Weh a gwaan, Daisy?”</p>
<p>Mi did fraid, mi can tell yuh; Mi neva si no gyal laik dat bifuor.</p>
<p>“Yah, dearries.” Shi grop roun inna a wastebasket weh shi did have wid har pan di bed an pull out di string a pearls. “Tek dem dungstairs an gi dem back to whoeva dem belong to. Tell dem all Daisy's change' har mine. Seh: 'Daisy's change' har mine!' ”</p>
<p>Shi staat baal—shi baal an baal. Mi rush out an find har mada maid, an wi lock di door an get har inna a cold bath. Shi wudn let go a di leta. Shi tek it inna di tub wid har an squeeze it up inna a wet ball, an only mek mi lef it inna di soap-dish wen she si seh it did a come to pieces like snow.</p>
<p>Bot shi neva se no ada wod. Wi gi har spirits a ammonia an put ice pan har forehead an hook har back inna har dress, an half an hour later, wen wi walk outa di room, di pearls dem did deh roun har neck an di incident did don. Nex day at five o'clock she married Tom Buchanan widout so much as a shiver, an staat off pan a three months' trip to di South Seas.</p>
<p>Mi si dem a Santa Barbara wen dem kom bak, an mi did tingk se mi neva si no gyal so mad bout ar ozban. If him lef di room fi a minute she woulda look roun uneasily, an seh: “Weh Tom gaan?” an wear di most abstract expression until she si him a come inna di door. Shi yuus tu sidong pan di san wid im ed ina ar lap bai di owa, a rob ar fingga dem uova im yai dem an a luk pan im wid unfathomable delight. It did touching fi si dem tugeda—it mek yuh laugh inna a hushed, fascinated way. Dat was inna August. A week afta mi lef Santa Barbara Tom run inna a wagon pan di Ventura road one night, an rip a front wheel off him car. Di gyal weh did deh wid him get inna di papers, too, cause har arm did break—shi was one a di chambermaids inna di Santa Barbara Hotel.</p>
<p>Di neks Iepril Daisy av ar likl gyal pikni, an dem go a Frans fi a ier. Mi si dem one spring inna Cannes, an later inna Deauville, an den dem come back a Chicago fi settle dung. Daisy did popular inna Chicago, as yuh know. Dem move wid a fast crowd, all a dem young an rich an wild, but she come out wid an absolutely perfect reputation. Miebi kaaz shi no jringk. A one big advantage fi nuh drink mongst hard-drinking people. Yuh can hold yuh tongue an, moreover, yuh can time any likkle irregularity a yuh own so dat everybody else so blind dat dem nuh see or care. Miebi Daisy neva go in fi amour at all—an yet deh deh someting inna dat deh voice a har...</p>
<p>Well, bout six weeks ago, she hear di name Gatsby fi di first time inna years. A did wen mi aks yu—yu memba?—if yu did nuo Gatsby inna West Egg. Afta yuh did go home she come inna mi room an wake mi up, an seh: “Weh Gatsby?” an wen mi did a describe him—mi did half asleep—she seh inna di strangest voice seh a mosi di man weh she used to know. A neva til den mi kanek dis ya Gatsby wid di afisa inna ar wait kyaar.</p>

<p>Wen Jordan Baker did finish tell all dis we did lef di Plaza fi half an hour an did a drive inna a victoria thru Central Park. Di sun did go dung behind di tall apartments a di movie stars inna di West Fifties, an di clear voices a di pickney dem, weh did already gather like crickets pan di grass, did a rose thru di hot twilight:</p>
<blockquote class="verse"><div>
<p>
<span>“Mi a di Sheik a Araby.</span>
<br/>
<span>Yu lov bilang tu mi.</span>
<br/>
<span>At night wen yuh a sleep</span>
<br/>
<span>Inna yuh tent mi ago creep—”</span>
</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“A did a strange coincidence,” mi seh.</p>
<p>“But it neva did a coincidence at all.”</p>
<p>"Wah mek?"</p>
<p>“Gatsby buy dat deh house so dat Daisy woulda deh jus across di bay.”</p>
<p>Den it neva did jus di stars dem weh him did a aspire to pan dat deh June night. Him come alive to mi, delivered suddenly fram di womb a him purposeless splendour.</p>
<p>“Im waan know,” Jordan continued, “if yuh wi invite Daisy to yuh yaad some aftanuun an den mek him come ova.”</p>
<p>Di modesty a di demand shake mi. Im did wait five years an buy a mansion weh im did dispense starlight to casual moths—so dat im coulda “come ova” some aftanuun to a stranger's garden.</p>
<p>“Mi did haffi know all dis before him coulda ask such a likkle ting?”</p>
<p>“Im fried, im wiet so lang. Im did tingk se yu maita get beks. Yu si, im regyula tof anda it aal.”</p>
<p>Somting did a worry mi.</p>
<p>“Why him neva ask yuh fi arrange a meeting?”</p>
<p>“Im waan har fi si im yaad,” shi explain. “An yuh house deh right next door.”</p>
<p>"Awo!"</p>
<p>“Mi tink him did half expect har fi wander inna one a him parties, some night,” seh Jordan, “but she neva did. Den him staat ask people casually if dem did know har, an mi was di first one him find. A did dat deh night him sen fi mi at him dance, an yuh shuda did hear di elaborate way him work up to it. A chuu, mi did suggest a lunch siem taim—an mi did tink inna New York—an mi did tink seh inna New York lunch siem taim. him woulda go mad:</p>
<p>“ 'Mi nuh waan do nutten outa di way!' him kip aan a seh 'Mi waan see har right next door.'</p>
<p>“Wen mi seh yuh a one particular fren a Tom, him staat fi abandon di whole idea. Him nuh know much bout Tom, though him seh him read a Chicago paper fi years jus pan di chance fi ketch a glimpse a Daisy name.”</p>
<p>It did dark now, an as we did a dip unda a likkle bridge mi put mi arm roun Jordan's golden shoulda an draw har toward mi an ask har fi dinner. Suddenly mi neva did a tink bout Daisy an Gatsby no more, but bout dis clean, hard, limited person, weh did a deal wid universal scepticism, an weh did a lean back jauntily jus widin di circle a mi arm. A phrase staat beat inna mi ears wid a sort a heady excitement: “A only di pursued, di pursuing, di busy, an di tired.”</p>
<p>“An Daisy shuda have someting inna har life,” Jordan murmured to mi.</p>
<p>“She waan see Gatsby?”</p>
<p>“She no fi know bout it. Gatsby nuh waan har fi know. Yuh jus suppose fi invite har to tea.”</p>
<p>Wi pass a barrier a dark trees, an den di façade a Fifty-Ninth Street, a block a delicate pale light, beam dong inna di park. Unlike Gatsby an Tom Buchanan, mi neva have no girl whose disembodied face did a float along di dark cornices an blinding signs, an so mi draw up di girl beside mi, tightening mi arms. Har wan, scornful mout smile, an so mi draw har up again closer, dis time to mi face.</p>
