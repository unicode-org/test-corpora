<h2>VIII</h2>
<p>Mi kudn sliip aal nait; a foghorn did a groan incessantly pan di Sound, an mi toss half-sick between grotesque reality an savage, frightening dreams. Towad maanin mi ier wahn taksi go op Gatsby jraiv, an siem taim mi jomp outa bed an staat jres op—mi fiil se mi av sopm fi tel im, sopm fi waan im bout, an maanin wuda tuu liet.</p>
<p>Wen mi did a cross him lawn, mi si seh him front door did still open an him did a lean gens a table inna di hall, heavy wid dejection or sleep.</p>
<p>“Notn neva happen,” him seh wanly. “Mi wiet, an bout fuor aklak shi kom a di winda an tan de fi a minit an den ton out di lait.”</p>
<p>Him house neva did look so enormous to mi as it did dat deh night wen we did a hunt thru di great rooms fi cigarettes. Wi push aside curtains weh did like pavilions, an feel ova innumerable feet a dark wall fi electric light switches—once mi tumble wid a sort a splash pan di keys a one ghostly piano. A did a inexplicable amount a dust everyweh, an di rooms dem did musty, as if dem neva get air fi nuff days. Mi find di humidor pan a unfamiliar table, wid two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Wi did a fling open di French windows dem a di drawing-room, an wi did a smoke out inna di darkness.</p>
<p>“Yuh shuda go weh,” mi seh. “It pretty certain dem ago trace yuh car.”</p>
<p>“Go weh <i>now</i> , old sport?”</p>
<p>“Go a Atlantic City fi a week, or up a Montreal.”</p>
<p>Him wouldn't consider it. Him couldn't possibly lef Daisy until him did know weh she did a go do. Him did a clutch at some last hope an mi couldn't bear fi shake him free.</p>
<p>A did dis night dat him tell mi di strange story a him youth wid Dan Cody—tell it to mi cause “Jay Gatsby” did break up like glass against Tom's hard malice, an di long secret extravaganza did play out. Mi tink seh him woulda acknowledge anyting now, widout reserve, but him did waan talk bout Daisy.</p>
<p>Shi was di first “nice” girl weh him eva know. Inna various unrevealed capacities him did come inna contact wid such people, but always wid indiscernible barbed wire between. Him find har excitingly desirable. Im go a har yaad, fos wid ada officers fram Camp Taylor, den im alone. It amazed him—im neva deh inna such a beautiful house before. But weh gi it an air a breathless intensity, was dat Daisy did live deh—it was as casual a ting to har as him tent out a camp was to him. Deh did have a ripe mystery bout it, a hint a bedrooms upstairs weh did more beautiful an cool dan ada bedrooms, a gay an radiant activities weh did a tek place thru it corridors, an a romances weh neva musty an laid weh already inna lavender but fresh an breathing an redolent a dis year's shining motorcars an a flowers weh did a dance wid scarly. It excited him, too, dat plenty man did already love Daisy—it increase har value inna him eyes. Im did feel dem presence all bout di house, pervading di air wid di shades an echoes a still vibrant emotions.</p>
<p>But him did know seh him did deh inna Daisy's house by a colossal accident. However glorious him future as Jay Gatsby, him was at present a penniless young man widout a past, an at any moment di invisible cloak a him uniform might slip fram him shoulda. So him mek di most a him time. Im tek weh im coulda get, ravenously an unscrupulously—eventually im tek Daisy one still October night, tek har cause im neva have no real right fi touch har han.</p>
<p>Him mighta did despise himself, cause him did certainly tek har unda false pretences. Mi no mean seh him did trade pan him phantom millions, but him did deliberately gi Daisy a sense a security; him mek har believe seh him a did a person fram di same strata as harself—dat him did fully able fi tek care a har. As a matter a fact, him neva have no such facilities—im neva have no comfortable family standing behind him, an him did liable at di whim a one impersonal government fi be blown anywhere bout di world.</p>
<p>Bot im neva disrispek imself an it neva ton out laik ou im did tingk. Him did intended, probably, fi tek weh him coulda an go—but now him find out seh him did commit himself to di following a a grail. Im did know seh Daisy did extraordinary, but im neva realize jus how extraordinary a “nice” girl coulda be. Shi vanish inna har rich house, inna har rich, full life, lef Gatsby—nothing. Im did feel married to har, dat was all.</p>
<p>Wen dem meet again, two days later, a did Gatsby weh did breathless, weh did, somehow, betray. Har porch did bright wid di buught luxury a star-shine; di wicker a di settee squeak fashionably as she turn toward him an him kiss har curious an lovely mout. Shi did kech a cold, an it mek har voice huskier an more charming dan eva, an Gatsby did overwhelmingly aware a di youth an mystery weh wealth imprison an preserve, a di freshness a plenty clothes, an a Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe an proud above di hot struggles a di poor.</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Mi cyan describe to yuh how surprised mi did fi find out seh mi love har, old sport. Mi did even hope fi a while seh she woulda throw mi ova, but she neva, cause she did inna love wid mi too. Shi did tink seh mi did know a lot cause mi did know different tings fram har... Well, deh mi did deh, way off mi ambitions, getting deeper inna love every minute, an all a care, Weh mi neva did sudden. di use a doing great tings if mi coulda have a betta time a tell har weh mi a go do?”</p>
<p>Pan di laas aftanuun bifuo im go a farin, im did sidong wid Daisy ina im an dem fi a lang, sailent taim. A did a cold fall day, wid fire inna di room an har cheeks did a flush. Now an den she move an him change him arm likkle, an once him kiss har dark shining hair. Di aftanuun did mek dem tranquil fi a while, as if fi gi dem a deep memory fi di long parting weh di next day did promise. Dem neva did closer inna dem month a love, nor communicate more profoundly one wid anodda, dan wen she brush silent lips against him coat's shoulder or wen him touch di end a har fingers, gently, as if she did a sleep.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Im did extraordinarily well inna di war. Im was a captain before im goh to di front, an afta di Argonne battles im get im majority an di command a di divisional machine-guns. Afta di armistice him did a try frantically fi get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sen him to Oxford instead. Im did a worry now—a did a quality a nervous despair inna Daisy letta dem. Shi neva si wa mek im kudn kom. Shi did a feel di pressure a di worl outside, an shi did waan see him an feel him presence beside har an be reassured seh she did a do di right ting afta all.</p>
<p>For Daisy did young an har artificial world did redolent a orchids an pleasant, cheerful snobbery an orchestras weh set di rhythm a di year, summing up di sadness an suggestiveness a life inna new tunes. All night di saxophones dem did a wail di hopeless comment a di “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs a golden an silver slippers did a shuffle di shining dust. At di grey tea hour deh did always have rooms weh did a throb incessantly wid dis low, sweet fever, while fresh faces did a drift yah an deh like rose petals weh di sad horns dem did a blow roun di floor.</p>
<p>Thru dis twilight universe Daisy staat move again wid di season; suddenly she did a keep again half a dozen dates a day wid half a dozen man, an a drowsing asleep at dawn wid di beads an chiffon a one evening-dress tangled among dying orchids pan di floor beside har bed. An all di time someting widin har did a cry fi a decision. Shi did waan har life shape now, immediately—an di decision haffi mek by some force—a love, a money, a unquestionable practicality—dat did deh close at han.</p>
<p>Dat deh force tek shape inna di middle a spring wid di arrival a Tom Buchanan. A did a wholesome bulkiness bout him person an him position, an Daisy did flattered. Doubtless deh did have a certain struggle an a certain relief. Di leta reach Gatsby wile him did still deh a Oxford.</p>
<hr/>
<p>A did maanin nou pan Lang Ailan an wi go bout a uopn di res a di windo dem dongstairs, a ful op di ous wid grii-ton, guol-ton lait. Di shadow a one tree fall abruptly across di dew an ghostly birds staat sing mongst di blue leaves. A did a slow, pleasant movement inna di air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.</p>
<p>“Mi nuh tink she eva love him.” Gatsby ton roun fram a window an look pan mi challengingly. “Yuh mus memba, old sport, she did very excited dis aftanoon. Him tell har dem ting deh inna a way weh fraiten har—dat mek it look like mi a did some kinda cheap sharper. An di result was she hardly know weh she did a seh.”</p>
<p>Im sidong gloomily.</p>
<p>“Af kourz shi maita did lov im jos fi a minit, wen dem did fos marid—an lov mi muor iivn den, yu si?”</p>
<p>Suddenly him come out wid a curious remark.</p>
<p>“In any case,” him seh, “it was jus personal.”</p>
<p>Weh yuh coulda mek a dat, except fi suspect some intensity inna him conception a di affair weh couldn't be measured?</p>
<p>Im come back fram France wen Tom an Daisy did still deh pan dem wedding trip, an mek a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville pan di last a im army pay. Im stay deh fi a week, a walk di streets dem weh dem footsteps did a click tugeda chruu di November night an a revisit di out-of-di-way places dem weh dem did a drive inna har white car. Jus like how Daisy's house did always seem to him more mysterious an gay dan other houses, so him idea a di city itself, even though she did gaan fram it, did pervade wid a melancholy beauty.</p>
<p>Im lef feeling seh if im did look harder, im mighta did find har—seh im did a lef har behind. Di day-coach—im did a peniless now—did hot. Im go out to di open vestibule an sidong pan a folding-chair, an di station slid weh an di backs a unfamiliar buildings move by. Den out inna di spring fields, weh a yellow trolley did a race dem fi a minute wid people inna it weh might once did see di pale magic a har face along di casual street.</p>
<p>Di track did a curve an now it did a go weh fram di sun, weh, as it did a sink lower, did a look like it did a spread itself inna benediction ova di vanishing city weh she did a draw har breath. Him stretch out him han desperately as if fi snatch only a wisp a air, fi save a fragment a di spot weh she did mek lovely fi him. But it did a goh by too fast now fi him blurred eyes an him did know seh him did lose dat deh part a it, di freshest an di bes, fi eva.</p>
<p>A did nain aklak wen wi don iit brekfas an go out pan di porch. Di nait did mek a shaap difrans inna di weda an a did wan autumn flavor inna di ier. Di gardener, di last one a Gatsby's former servants, come to di foot a di steps.</p>
<p>“Mi a go drain di pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves ago staat fall pretty soon, an den yuh always have trouble wid di pipes.”</p>
<p>“No du it tide,” Gatsby ansa. Him turn to mi apologetically. “Yuh know, old sport, mi neva use dat deh pool all summer?”</p>
<p>Mi look pan mi watch an stan up.</p>
<p>“Twelve minutes to mi train.”</p>
<p>Mi neva waan go a di city. Mi neva worth a decent stroke a work, but it was more dan dat—mi neva waan lef Gatsby. Mi miss dat deh train, an den anodda one, before mi coulda get miself weh.</p>
<p>“Mi wi call yuh up,” mi seh finally.</p>
<p>“Du, old sport.”</p>
<p>“Mi ago call yuh bout noon.”</p>
<p>Wi walk slow dung di steps.</p>
<p>“Mi suppose Daisy ago call too.” Im look pan mi anxiously, as if im did a hope seh mi woulda corroborate dis.</p>
<p>“Mi suppose so.”</p>
<p>“Well, goodbye.”</p>
<p>Wi shake han an mi staat weh. Jus before mi reach di hedge mi memba someting an turn roun.</p>
<p>“Dem a ratn kroud,” mi baal out kraas di lan. “Yuh worth di whole damn bunch put tugeda.”</p>
<p>Mi always glad mi seh dat. A di ongl kompliment mi eva gi im, kaa mi neva grii wid im fram staat tu en. Fos him nod politely, an den him face break inna dat deh radiant an understanding smile, as if wi did deh inna ecstatic cahoots pan dat deh fact all di time. Him gorgeous pink rag a suit mek a bright spot a color against di white steps, an mi did tink bout di night wen mi first come to him ancestral home, three months before. Di lawn an drive did full a di face a dem weh did a guess at him corruption—an him did a stan op pan dem step deh, a conceal him incorruptible dream, as him a wave dem goodbye.</p>
<p>Mi tank him fi him hospitality. Wi did aalwiez a tank im fi dat—mi an di ada wan dem.</p>
<p>“Gudbai,” mi kaal. “Mi did enjoy breakfast, Gatsby.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Op inna di city, mi try fi a while fi list di quotations pan an interminable amount a stock, den mi fall asleep inna mi swivel-chair. Jus before noon di phone wake mi, an mi staat up wid sweat a break out pan mi forehead. A did Jordan Baker; shi often call mi up at dis hour cause di uncertainty a har own movements between hotels an clubs an private houses mek har hard fi find inna any other way. Usually har voice did come ova di wire as someting fresh an cool, as if a divot fram a green golf-links did come sailing in at di office window, but dis morning it did look harsh an dry.</p>
<p>“Mi lef Daisy yaad,” shi se. “Mi deh a Hempstead, an mi a go dung a Southampton dis aftanuun.”</p>
<p>Probably it did been tactful fi lef Daisy's house, but di act annoyed mi, an har next remark mek mi rigid.</p>
<p>“Yuh neva so nice to mi last night.”</p>
<p>“How it coulda did matter den?”</p>
<p>Silence fi a moment. Den:</p>
<p>“However—mi waan see yuh.”</p>
<p>“Mi waan see yuh, too.”</p>
<p>“Suppose mi nuh go a Southampton, an come inna town dis aftanoon?”</p>
<p>“No—mi nuh tink dis aftanuun.”</p>
<p>“Very well.”</p>
<p>“It impossible dis aftanoon. Various—”</p>
<p>Wi did a talk like dat fi a while, an den abruptly wi neva did a talk no longer. Mi no nuo wich wan a wi eng op wid a shaap klik, bot mi nuo se mi neva kier. Mi couldn't talk to har across a tea-table dat deh day deh if mi neva talk to har again inna dis ya worl.</p>
<p>Mi call Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but di line did busy. Mi try four times; finally an exasperated central tell mi seh di wire did a keep open fi long distance fram Detroit. Tek out mi timetable, mi draw a likkle circle roun di three-fifty train. Den mi lean back inna mi chair an try fi tink. A did jus noon.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Wen mi pass di ash-heaps dem pan di train dat deh maanin mi did cross deliberately to di ada side a di car. Mi did suppose seh a did a curious crowd roun deh all day wid likkle bwoy dem a look fi dark spots inna di dust, an some garrulous man a tell ova an ova weh did happen, until it become less an less real even to him an him coulda tell it no longer, an Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement did get forget. Now mi waan go back likkle an tell weh happen a di garage afta wi lef deh di night before.</p>
<p>Dem did have difficulty fi find di sista, Catherine. Shi mosi did brok har rule gens jringk da nait de, kaa wen shi riich shi did stupid wid liquor an kudn andastan se di ambulance did don go a Flushing aredi. Wen dem convince har a dis, she immediately faint, as if dat was di intolerable part a di affair. Sombadi, kind or curious, tek har inna him car an drive har inna di wake a har sista body.</p>
<p>Til lang afta midnight a changing crowd lap up against di front a di garage, while George Wilson did a rock himself back an forth pan di couch inside. Fi a while di door a di office did open, an everybody weh did come inna di garage did a look irresistibly chruu it. Finally smadi se a shiem, an dem lak di duor. Michaelis an some ada man did deh wid him; fos, four or five man, later two or three man. Stil later Michaelis did haffi ask di laas stranger fi wait deh fifteen minutes longer, while him go back to him own place an mek a pot a coffee. Afta dat, him stay deh alone wid Wilson til maanin.</p>
<p>Bout three o'clock di quality a Wilson's incoherent muttering change—im get quieter an staat talk bout di yellow car. Im announce seh im have a way fi find out who di yellow car belong to, an den im blurt out seh a couple a months ago im wife did come fram di city wid har face bruised an har nose swollen.</p>
<p>But wen him hear himself seh dis, him flinch an staat cry “Oh, my God!” again inna him groaning voice. Michaelis mek a clumsy attempt fi distract him.</p>
<p>“How long yuh married, George? Come on deh, try an sit still fi a minute, an ansa mi kweschan. How long yuh married?”</p>
<p>“Twelve years.”</p>
<p>“Yuh eva have any pickney? Come on, George, sit still—mi ask yuh a kweschan. Yuh eva have any pickney?”</p>
<p>Di hard brown beetles dem did a keep thudding against di dull light, an whenever Michaelis hear a car a go tear along di road outside it sound to him like di car weh neva stop a few hours before. Him neva like fi go inna di garage, cause di work bench did stain weh di body did a lay, so him move uncomfortably roun di office—im did know every object inna it before morning—an fram time to time him did sidong beside Wilson a try keep him more quiet.</p>
<p>“Yuh have a church weh yuh go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if yuh neva deh deh fi a long time? Maybe mi coulda call up di church an get a priest fi come ova an him coulda talk to yuh, see?”</p>
<p>“No bilang tu nobadi.”</p>
<p>“Yu shuda have a church, George, fi times like dis. Yuh mosi did go a church once. Yuh neva get married inna a church? Lisn, George, lisn to mi. Yuh neva get married inna a church?”</p>
<p>“Dat was a long time ago.”</p>
<p>Di effort fi ansa break di rhythm a him rocking—fi a moment him did silent. Den di same half-knowing, half-bewildered look come back inna him faded eyes.</p>
<p>“Look inna di drawer deh,” him seh, pointing at di desk.</p>
<p>“Weh drawer?”</p>
<p>“Dat drawer—dat one.”</p>
<p>Michaelis open di drawer weh did deh nearest him han. Notn neva deh inna it but a likkle, expensive dog-leash, mek outa leather an braided silver. It was apparently new.</p>
<p>"Dis?" him ask, an hold it up.</p>
<p>Wilson stare an nod.</p>
<p>“Mi find it yeside aftanuun. Shi did a try fi tell mi bout it, but mi did know seh a did someting funny.”</p>
<p>“Yuh mean yuh wife buy it?”</p>
<p>“She did have it wrap inna tissue paper pan har bureau.”</p>
<p>Michaelis neva si notn odd inna dat, an him gi Wilson a dozen reasons why him wife mighta did buy di dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson did hear some a dem same explanation deh before, fram Myrtle, cause him staat seh “Oh, my God!” again inna a whisper—him comforter lef several explanations inna di air.</p>
<p>“Den him kill har,” Wilson seh. Him mout drop open suddenly.</p>
<p>“A who did?”</p>
<p>“Mi have a way fi find out.”</p>
<p>“Yu morbid, Jaaj,” im fren se. “Dis a wan aad aad fi yu an yu no nuo wa yu a se. Yu beta chrai an sidong kwaiyat til maanin.”</p>
<p>“Im murder har.”</p>
<p>“A did a accident, George.”</p>
<p>Wilson shiek him head. Him eyes dem narrow an him mout widen likkle wid di ghost a one superior “Hm!”</p>
<p>“Mi know,” him seh definitely. “Mi a one a dem trusting fellas an mi nuh tink no harm to <i>nobadi</i> , but wen mi get fi know a ting mi know it. A did di man inna dat deh car. She run out fi talk to him an him neva waan stop.”</p>
<p>Michaelis did si dis too, but it neva come to him seh it did have any special significance inna it. Im did believe seh Mrs. Wilson did a run weh fram har husband, radda dan try fi stop any particular car.</p>
<p>“How she coulda be like dat?”</p>
<p>“She a one deep one,” Wilson seh, as if dat ansa di kweschan. “Ah-hh—”</p>
<p>Im staat rock again, an Michaelis stan up a twist di leash inna im han.</p>
<p>“Maybe yuh have some fren weh mi coulda telephone fi, George?”</p>
<p>Dis was a forlorn hope—im did almost sure seh Wilson neva have no fren: it neva have enough a him fi him wife. Im did glad likkle later wen im notice a change inna di room, a blue quickening by di window, an realize seh dawn neva far off. Bout five o'clock it did blue enough outside fi snap off di light.</p>
<p>Wilson's glazed eyes turn out to di ash-heaps, weh small gray clouds tek on fantastic shapes an scurried yah an deh inna di faint dawn wind.</p>
<p>“Mi did a taak to har,” him mutter, afta a long silence. “Mi tell har she might fool mi but she couldn't fool God. Mi tek har to di window”—wid an effort him get up an walk to di rear window an lean wid him face pressed against it—“an mi seh 'God know weh yuh a do, everyting yuh a do. Yuh may fool mi, but yuh cyaan fool God! ”</p>
<p>Stan behind him, Michaelis si wid a shock seh him did a look pan di eyes a Doctor TJ Eckleburg, weh did jus come out, pale an enormous, fram di dissolving night.</p>
<p>“God see everyting,” Wilson repeated.</p>
<p>“Dat a one advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Somting mek im ton we fram di winda an luk bak inna di ruum. But Wilson did a stan op deh fi a long time, him face close to di window pane, a nod inna di twilight.</p>
<hr/>
<p>By six o'clock Michaelis did wear out, an grateful fi di sound a one car weh did a stop outside. A did one a di watchers dem a di night before weh did promise fi come back, so him cook breakfast fi three, weh him an di ada man did nyam tugeda. Wilson did quieter now, an Michaelis go home fi sleep; wen him wake up four hours later an hurry back to di garage, Wilson did gaan.</p>
<p>Him movements—im did deh pan foot all di time—weh afterward trace to Port Roosevelt an den to Gad's Hill, weh him buy a sandwich weh him neva eat, an a cup a coffee. Im mosi did taiyad an a waak likl bit, kaa im neehn riich Gad Il til nait. So far deh neva have no difficulty fi account fi him time—dem did have bwoys weh did see a man “a act sort of crazy,” an motorists weh him did a stare oddly pan fram di side a di road. Den fi three hours him disappear fram view. Di police, pan di strength a weh him seh to Michaelis, seh him “had a way fi find out,” suppose seh him spen dat time deh a go fram garage to garage thereabout, a inquiring fi a yellow car. Pan di ada han, no garage man weh did si him neva come forward, an perhaps him did have an easier, surer way fi find out weh him did waan know. By half-past two him did deh inna West Egg, weh him ask somebody di way to Gatsby's house. So bai da taim de im nuo Gatsby niem.</p>
<hr/>
<p>At two o'clock Gatsby put on him bathing-suit an lef word wid di butler seh if anybody phone word was fi bring to him at di pool. Him stop a di garage fi a pneumatic mattress weh did a amuse him guests dem during di summer, an di chauffeur help him fi pump it up. Den him gi instructions seh di open car neva fi tek out unda no circumstances—an dis was strange, cause di front right fender did need repair.</p>
<p>Gatsby shoulder di mattress an staat fi di pool. Once him stop an shift it likkle, an di chauffeur ask him if him need help, but him shake him head an inna a moment disappear mongst di yellowing trees.</p>
<p>No telephone message neva come, but di butler go widout him sleep an wait fi it til four o'clock—til lang afta deh did have anybody fi gi it to if it come. Mi have an idea seh Gatsby himself neva believe it woulda come, an perhaps him neva care no more. If dat was true him mus did feel seh him did lose di ole warm world, pay a high price fi living too long wid a single dream. Im mus did look up pan a unfamiliar sky chruu frightening leaves an shiver as im find out weh a grotesque ting a rose is an how raw di sunlight did deh pan di scarcely created grass. A new worl, material widout being real, weh poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously bout... like dat deh ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through di amorphous trees.</p>
<p>Di chauffeur—im was one a Wolfshiem's protégés—hear di shots—aftawards im coulda only seh dat im neva tink nutten much bout dem. Mi drive fram di station directly to Gatsby's house an mi rushing anxiously up di front steps was di first ting weh alarm anybody. But dem did know den, mi firmly believe. Wid scarcely a word seh, four a wi, di chauffeur, butler, gardener, an mi hurry dung to di pool.</p>
<p>Deh did have a faint, barely perceptible movement a di wata as di fresh flow fram one end did a urge it way toward di drain at di other. Wid likkle ripples weh did hardly di shadows a waves, di laden mattress did a move irregularly dung di pool. A likkle gust a wind weh scarcely corrugate di surface did enough fi disturb it accidental course wid it accidental burden. Di touch a one cluster a leaves revolve it slowly, tracing, like di leg a transit, a thin red circle inna di wata.</p>
<p>A afta wi staat wid Gatsby tuwaadz di ous dat di gyaadna si Wilson badi likl wie aaf ina di graas, an di holocaust did don.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter-9">
<h2>IX</h2>
<p>Afta two years mi memba di rest a dat deh day, an dat deh night an di next day, only as an endless drill a police an photographers an newspaper man in an out a Gatsby's front door. A rope stretch across di main gate an a policeman by it keep out di curious, but likkle bwoys soon discover seh dem coulda enter thru mi yard, an deh did always have a few a dem clustered open-mouthed bout di pool. Sombadi wid a positive manner, perhaps a detective, use di expression “madman” as him bent ova Wilson body dat deh aftanoon, an di adventitious authority a him voice set di key fi di newspaper reports next morning.</p>
<p>Most a dem report deh was a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, an untrue. Wen Michaelis testimony at di inquest bring to light Wilson's suspictions a him wife mi did tink di whole tale woulda shortly be served up inna racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who mighta did seh anyting, neva seh a word. Shi did show a surprising amount a character bout it too—look pan di coroner wid determined eyes unda dat deh corrected brow a har, an swore seh har sista neva si Gatsby, seh har sista did completely happy wid har husband, seh har sista neva have no mischief whatever. Shi convince harself a it, an cry inna har handkerchief, as if di very suggestion was more dan she coulda endure. So Wilson did get reduce to a man “deranged by grief” in order dat di case coulda remain inna it simplest form. An it res deh.</p>
<p>But all dis part a it did look remote an unessential. Mi find miself pan Gatsby's side, an alone. Fram di moment mi telephone news a di catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise bout him, an every practical question, did a refer to mi. At first mi did surprised an confused; den, as him did a lay inna him house an neva move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grow pan mi seh mi was responsible, cause nobadi else neva interested—interested, mi mean, wid dat intense personal interest to which everybody have some vague right at di end.</p>
<p>Mi call up Daisy half an hour afta we find him, call har instinctively an widout hesitation. But she an Tom did gaan weh early dat deh aftanoon, an tek baggage wid dem.</p>
<p>“Yuh no lef no address?”</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>“Seh wen dem woulda come back?”</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>“Eni idea weh dem deh? How mi coulda reach dem?”</p>
<p>“Mi nuh know. Cyan seh.”</p>
<p>Mi did waan get sombady fi him. Mi did waan go inna di room weh him did a lay an assure him: “Mi ago get somebody fi yuh, Gatsby. No bada worry. Jus trust mi an mi ago get somebody fi yuh—”</p>
<p>Meyer Wolfshiem name neva deh inna di phone book. Di butler gi mi him office address pan Broadway, an mi call Information, but by di time mi have di numba it did lang afta five, an nobadi neva ansa di phone.</p>
<p>“Yuh ago ring again?”</p>
<p>“Mi rung three times.”</p>
<p>“It very important.”</p>
<p>“Sari. Mi fried nobadi no de de.”</p>
<p>Mi go back to di drawing-room an tink fi a instant seh dem a did chance visitors, all dem official people deh weh suddenly full it. But, though dem draw back di sheet an look pon Gatsby wid shocked eyes, him protest continue inna mi brain:</p>
<p>“Luk yah, uol sport, yuh haffi get sombady fi mi. Yuh haffi try haad. Mi cyan go chruu dis alone.”</p>
<p>Sombadi staat aks mi kweschan, bot mi brok we an go opstairs luk kwik-kwik chuu di paat dem we neva lak op a im desk—im neva tel mi fi shuor se im mada an faada ded. But notn neva deh deh—only di picture a Dan Cody, a token a forgetten violence, a stare dung fram di wall.</p>
<p>Next morning mi sen di butler to New York wid a letta to Wolfshiem, weh ask fi information an urge him fi come out pan di next train. Dat deh request did look superfluous wen mi write it. Mi did sure him woulda staat wen him see di newspapers, jus like how mi did sure seh a did a wire fram Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem did arrive; nobadi neva arrive except more police an photographers an newspaper man. Wen di butler bring back Wolfshiem's ansa mi staat fi have a feeling a defiance, a scornful solidarity between Gatsby an mi against dem all.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>Dear Mr. Carraway. Dis a one a di most terrible shocks a mi life to mi mi hardly can believe it seh it true at all. Such a mad act like dat deh man did do shuda mek di all wi tink. Mi cyan come dung now as mi tie up inna some very important business an cyaan get mix up inna dis ting now. If deh deh anyting mi can do likkle later mek mi know inna a letta by Edgar. Mi hardly know weh mi deh wen mi hear bout a ting like dis an mi completely knock dung an out.</p>
<p class="valediction">Yu truly</p>
<p class="signature">Meyer Wolfshiem</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">an den hasty addenda anda:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>Mek mi know bout di funeral etc nuh know him family at all.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Wen di phone ring dat deh aftanoon an Long Distance seh Chicago did a call mi did tink dis woulda be Daisy at last. But di connection come chruu as a man's voice, very thin an far away.</p>
<p>“Dis a Slagle a taak…”</p>
<p>"Yea?" Di name neva familiar.</p>
<p>“Hell a note, noh true? Get mi wire?”</p>
<p>“No wire neva deh deh.”</p>
<p>“Young Parke inna trouble,” him seh rapidly. “Dem pick him up wen him gi di bonds dem ova di counter. Dem get a circular fram New York weh gi dem di numba dem jus five minutes before. Weh yuh know bout dat, hey? Yuh neva can tell inna dem hick towns—”</p>
<p>"Ello!" Mi interrupt breathlessly. “Luk ya—dis a no Misa Gatsby. Misa Gatsby ded.”</p>
<p>A did a long silence pan di ada end a di wire, an den a exclamation... den a quick squawk as di connection did brok.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Mi tink a did pan di third day dat a telegram wid Henry C. Gatz did sign fram a town inna Minnesota. It seh only dat di sender did a lef immediately an fi postpone di funeral until him come.</p>
<p>A did Gatsby's fadda, a solemn old man, very helpless an dismayed, bundled up inna a long cheap ulster against di warm September day. Him eyes dem did a leak continuously wid excitement, an wen mi tek di bag an umbrella fram him han dem him staat pull so incessantly at him sparse gray beard dat mi did have difficulty fi get off him coat. Him did deh pan di point a collapse, so mi tek him inna di music-room an mek him sit dung while mi sen fi someting fi eat. But him neva waan eat, an di glass a milk spuot fram him an weh did a chrimbl.</p>
<p>“Mi si it inna di Chicago newspaper,” him seh. “Aal a it did deh inna di Chicago newspaper. Mi staat right away.”</p>
<p>“Mi neva know how fi reach yuh.”</p>
<p>Him eyes, seeing nutten, move ceaselessly bout di room.</p>
<p>“A did a madman,” him seh. “Im mosi did mad.”</p>
<p>“Yu wudn laik som kaafi?” Mi urge him.</p>
<p>“Mi no waahn notn. Mi aal rait nou, Misa.—”</p>
<p>“Carraway.”</p>
<p>“Wel, mi aal rait nou. We dem get Jimi?”</p>
<p>Mi tek him inna di drawing-room, weh him son did a lay, an lef him deh. Som likkle bwoy did come up pan di steps an did a look inna di hall; wen mi tell dem who did come, dem go weh widout reluctant.</p>
<p>Afta a likkle while Mr. Gatz open di door an come out, him mout ajar, him face flush likkle, him eyes a leak isolated an unpunctual tears. Im did reach an age weh death no have di quality a ghastly surprise no more, an wen im look roun im now fi di first time an si di height an splendor a di hall an di great rooms dem a open out fram it inna ada rooms, im grief staat fi mix wid an awed pride. Mi help him to a bedroom upstairs; wile him tek off him coat an vest mi tell him seh all arrangements did defer til him come.</p>
<p>“Mi neva know weh yuh woulda waan, Mr. Gatsby—”</p>
<p>“Gatz a mi name.”</p>
<p>“—Mr. Gatz. Mi did tink yuh might waan tek di body West.”</p>
<p>Im shiek im head.</p>
<p>“Jimmy always did like it better dung East. Him did rise up to him position inna di East. Yuh was a fren a mi bwoy's, Mr.—?”</p>
<p>“Wi was close frens.”</p>
<p>“Im did have a big future before him, yuh know. Him was only a young man, but him did have a lot a brain power yah.”</p>
<p>Im touch im head impressively, an mi nod.</p>
<p>“If him did live, him woulda be a great man. A man like James J. Hill. Him woulda help build up di country.”</p>
<p>“Dat a true,” mi seh, uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Im fumble at di embroidered coverlet, trying fi tek it fram di bed, an lay dung stiffly—im instantly asleep.</p>
<p>Dat deh night deh one obviously frightened person call up, an demand fi know who mi is before him woulda give him name.</p>
<p>“Dis a Mr. Carraway,” mi seh.</p>
<p>"Awo!" Im sound relieved. “Dis a Klipspringer.”</p>
<p>Mi did riliiv tu, kaa dat did luk laik se it did a pramis wan neda fren a Gatsby griev. Mi neva waan it fi deh inna di papers an draw a sightseeing crowd, so mi did a call up a few people miself. Dem did haad fi find dem.</p>
<p>“Di funeral a tumaro,” mi seh. “Chree o'clock, yah a di house. Mi wish yuh did tell anybody weh woulda be interested.”</p>
<p>“Oh, mi ago,” him break out hastily. “Af course mi naa go si nobadi, but if mi do.”</p>
<p>Him tone mek mi suspicious.</p>
<p>“Af course yuh wi deh deh yuhself.”</p>
<p>“Well, mi ago try fi sure. Weh mi call up bout is—”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” mi interrupt. “How bout seh yuh ago come?”</p>
<p>“Well, di fact is—di truth a di matter is dat mi a stay wid some people up yah inna Greenwich, an dem radda expect mi fi deh wid dem tomorrow. In fact, a sort a picnic or someting. A chuu mi ago do mi bes fi get weh.”</p>
<p>Mi ejaculate an unrestrained “Huh!” an him mosi did hear mi, cause him did a gwaan nervous:</p>
<p>“Weh mi call up bout was a pair a shoes mi lef deh. Mi wonder if it woulda be too much trouble fi have di butler send dem on. Yuh see, dem a tennis shoes, an mi sort a helpless widout dem. Mi address is care a BF—”</p>
<p>Mi neva hear di res a di name, cause mi heng up di receiver.</p>
<p>Afta dat mi feel a certain shame fi Gatsby—one gentleman weh mi telephone to implied seh him did get weh him deserve. However, dat was mi fault, cause him was one a dem weh use to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby pan di courage a Gatsby's liquor, an mi shuda did know betta dan fi call him.</p>
<p>Di maanin a di funeral mi go op a New York fi si Meyer Wolfshiem; Mi couldn't seem fi reach him no other way. Di door weh mi push open, pan di advice a one elevator bwoy, did mark “The Swastika Holding Company,” an at first it neva look like nobody did deh inside. But wen mi did shout “hello” several times in vain, an argument break out behind a partition, an presently a lovely Jewess appear at an interior door an scrutinize mi wid black hostile eyes.</p>
<p>“Nobody nuh deh inna,” she seh. “Mista Wolfshiem gaan a Chicago.”</p>
<p>Di fos part a dis was obviously untrue, fi somebody did staat whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.</p>
<p>“Please seh dat Mr. Carraway waan see him.”</p>
<p>“Mi cyan get him back fram Chicago, noh?”</p>
<p>At dis moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem's, call “Stella!” fram di ada side a di door.</p>
<p>“Lef yuh name pan di desk,” she seh quickly. “Mi wi gi im it wen im kom bak.”</p>
<p>“But mi know seh him deh deh.”</p>
<p>Shi tek a step toward mi an staat slide har han dem indignantly up an dung har hips.</p>
<p>“Unu yong man dem tingk se unu kyan fuos unu wie iin ya enitaim,” shi spuot. “Wi a get sickantired a it. Wen mi seh him deh inna Chicago, him deh inna Chi <i>ca</i> go.”</p>
<p>Mi did mention Gatsby.</p>
<p>“Oh-h!” Shi look pon mi ova again. “Yuh wi jus—Weh yuh niem?”</p>
<p>Shi vanish. Inna a moment Meyer Wolfshiem did a stan up solemnly inna di doorway, a hold out both him han dem. Im did a draw mi inna im office, an did a remark inna a reverent voice seh a did a sad time fi all a wi, an did a gi mi a cigar.</p>
<p>“Mi memory go back to wen mi first meet him,” him seh. “A young major jus out a di army an cover ova wid medals weh him get inna di war. Im did so haad up him did haffi keep on wear him uniform cause him couldn't buy some regular clothes. Fos time mi si him was wen him come inna Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street an ask fi a job. Him neva eat fi a couple a nutten wid some lunch pan mi. mi,’ mi se. Im iit muor dan fuor dala wot a fuud ina aaf a owa.”</p>
<p>“Yuh did staat him inna business?” Mi aks.</p>
<p>“Start him! Mi mek him.”</p>
<p>"Awo."</p>
<p>“Mi raise him up outa nothing, right outa di gutter. Mi si right away seh him was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, an wen him tell mi seh him deh a Oggsford mi know seh mi coulda use him good. Mi get him fi join di American Legion an him use to stan up high deh. Right off him did do some work fi a client a mine up to Albany like dat him did thick inna everyting— him did thick inna everyting. up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”</p>
<p>Mi did a wanda if dis partnership did include di World's Series transaction inna 1919.</p>
<p>“Now him dead,” mi seh afta a moment. “Yuh was him closest fren, so mi know yuh ago waan come to him funeral dis aftanoon.”</p>
<p>“Mi woulda like fi come.”</p>
<p>“Well, come den.”</p>
<p>Di hair inna him nostrils did a quiver likkle, an as him did a shake him head him eyes did a full a tears.</p>
<p>“Mi cyan do it—mi cyan get mix up inna it,” him seh.</p>
<p>“Notn nuh deh fi get mix up inna. It all ova now.”</p>
<p>“Wen a man get kill mi neva like fi get mix up inna it inna no way. Mi keep out. Wen mi was a young man it was different—if a fren a mi did dead, no matter how, mi stick wid dem to di end. Yuh may tink dat a sentimental, but mi mean it—to di bitter end.”</p>
<p>Mi si se fi som riizn im did mek op im main se im naa kom, so mi tan op.</p>
<p>“Yuh a one college man?” him ask suddenly.</p>
<p>Fi a moment mi did tink him did a go suggest a “gonnegtion,” but him only nod an shook mi han.</p>
<p>“Mek wi laan fi shuo wi frenship fi wan man wen im alaiv an no afta im ded,” im se. “Afta dat mi own rule is fi mek everyting alone.”</p>
<p>Wen mi lef him office di sky did ton dark an mi get back a West Egg inna a drizzle. Afta mi change mi clothes mi go next door an find Mr. Gatz a walk up an dung excitedly inna di hall. Him pride inna him son an inna him son's possessions did a continue increase an now him did have someting fi show mi.</p>
<p>“Jimmy sen mi dis picture.” Im tek out im wallet wid im fingga dem a chrimbl. “Look deh.”</p>
<p>A did a photograph a di house, crack inna di corner an dirty wid nuff hands. Im point out every detail to mi eagerly. “Look deh!” an den did a look fi admiration fram mi eyes. Im did show it so often dat mi tink it did more real to him now dan di house itself.</p>
<p>“Jimmy sen it gi mi. Mi tingk a wan uol iip a priti pikcha. It shuo op gud.”</p>
<p>“Very well. Yuh did si him lately?”</p>
<p>“Im come out fi si mi two years ago an buy mi di house weh mi live inna now. A chuu wi did broke up wen him run weh fram yaad, but mi see now seh a did a reason fi it. Im did know seh him did have a big future inna front a him. An ever since him mek a success him did very generous wid mi.”</p>
<p>Im did look reluctant fi put weh di picture, hold it fi anodda minute, lingeringly, before mi eyes. Den him return di wallet an tek outa him pocket a ragged old copy a one book weh dem call <i>Hopalong Cassidy</i> .</p>
<p>“Luk ya, dis a wan buk we im did av wen im a bwai. It jos shuo yu.”</p>
<p>Him open it at di back cover an turn it roun fi mi see. Pan di laas flyleaf did print di wod <b>schedule</b> , an di date September 12, 1906. An unda it:</p>

<p class="continued">“Mi come across dis book by accident,” di ole man seh. “It jus show yuh, noh nuh?”</p>
<p>“It jus show yuh.”</p>
<p>“Jimmy did bound fi get ahead. Him always have some resolves like dis or someting. Yuh notice weh him have bout improving him mind? Him did always great fi dat. Him tell mi seh mi et like a hog once, an mi beat him fi it.”</p>
<p>Im did reluctant fi close di book, reading each item loud an den look eagerly at mi. Mi tink him did rada expect mi fi copy dung di list fi mi own use.</p>
<p>A likkle before three di Lutheran minister arrive fram Flushing, an mi staat look involuntarily out di windows fi other cars. So did Gatsby faada. An as di time pass an di servants dem come in an stan up a wait inna di hall, him eyes dem staat blink anxiously, an him did a talk bout di rain inna a worried, uncertain way. Di minister glance plenty times pan him watch, so mi tek him aside an ask him fi wait fi half an hour. But it neva did have no use. Nobadi neva come.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Bout five o'clock wi procession a three cars reach di cemetery an stop inna a thick drizzle beside di gate—fos a motor hearse, horribly black an wet, den Mr. Gatz an di minister an mi inna di limousine, an a likkle later four or five servants an di postman fram West Egg, inna Gatsby's station, all to di wagon skin. As wi staat chruu di gate inna di cemetery mi hear a car stop an den di sound a somebody a splash afta wi ova di soggy ground. Mi look roun. A did di man wid owl-eyed glasses weh mi did find a marvel ova Gatsby's books inna di library one night three months before.</p>
<p>Mi neva si him since den. Mi no nuo ou im did nuo bout di funeral, ar iivn im niem. Di rain did a puor dung pan him thick glasses, an him tek dem off an wipe dem fi si di protecting canvas weh did a unroll fram Gatsby's grave.</p>
<p>Mi chrai tink bout Gatsby den fi a likl wail, bot im did tuu faar aredi, an mi kuda onggl memba, widout risentment, se Daisy neva sen no mechiz ar no plaant. Dimly mi hear somebody murmur “Blessed are di dead weh di rain fall pan,” an den di owl-eyed man seh “Amen to dat,” inna a brave voice.</p>
<p>Wi straggle dong quickly thru di rain to di cars. Owl-eyes did a taak to mi by di gate.</p>
<p>“Mi couldn't get to di house,” him remarked.</p>
<p>“Neither could anybody else.”</p>
<p>“Go on!” Im staat. “Wa, mi Gad, dem yuus tu go de bai onjrid.”</p>
<p>Im tek aaf im glaas dem an waip dem agen, outsaid an iin.</p>
<p>“Di poor son-of-a-bitch,” him seh.</p>
<hr/>
<p>One a mi most vivid memories is of coming back West fram prep school an later fram college at Christmas time. Dem who did go farther dan Chicago woulda gather inna di old dim Union Station at six o'clock a December evening, wid a few Chicago fren dem, already ketch up inna dem own holiday gaieties, fi bid dem a hasty goodbye. Mi memba di fur coats a di girls dem weh did a come back fram Miss This-or-That's an di chatter a frozen breath an di hands dem weh did a wave ovahead as we ketch sight a old acquaintances, an di matchings a invitations: “Yuh a go to di Ordways'? di Herseys'? di Schultzes'?" an di long green tickets dem did a clasp tight inna wi gloved han dem. An laas di murky yellow cars dem a di Chicago, Milwaukee an St. Paul railroad a look cheerful as Christmas itself pan di tracks dem beside di gate.</p>
<p>Wen wi pull out inna di winta night an di real snow, wi snow, staat stretch out beside wi an twinkle against di windows, an di dim lights a small Wisconsin stations move by, a sharp wild brace come suddenly inna di air. Wi did a draw inna deep breaths a it as we did a walk back fram dinner thru di cold vestibules, unatterably aware a wi identity wid dis country fi one strange hour, before we melt indistinguishably into it again.</p>
<p>Dat a mi Middle West—not di wheat or di prairies or di lost Swede towns, but di thrilling returning trains a mi youth, an di street lamps an sleigh bells inna di frosty dark an di shadows a holly wreaths weh lighted windows pan di snow throw. Mi a part a dat, a likkle solemn wid di feel a dem long winta deh, a likkle complacent fram growing up inna di Carraway house inna a city weh dwellings dem still a call chruu decades by a family's name. Mi si now seh dis a one story a di West, afta all—Tom an Gatsby, Daisy an Jordan an mi, a did all Westerners, an perhaps wi did have some deficiency in common weh mek wi subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.</p>
<p>Even wen di East did excite mi most, even wen mi did most keenly aware a it superiority to di bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond di Ohio, wid dem interminable inquisitions weh spare only di children an di very old—even den it did always fi mi a quality a distortion. West Egg, especially, still figure inna mi more fantastic dreams. Mi si it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional an grotesque, crouching unda a sullen, overhanging sky an a lustreless moon. Inna di foreground four solemn man inna dress suits a walk along di sidewalk wid a stretcher pan which lie a drunken woman inna a white evening dress. Har han, weh dangle ova di side, sparkle cold wid jewels. Gravely di man dem turn in a one house—di wrong house. Bot nobadi no nuo di uman niem, an nobadi no kya.</p>
<p>Afta Gatsby ded di East did haunted fi mi like dat, distorted beyond mi eyes's power of correction. So wen di bluu smoke a brittle leaves did inna di air an di wind did a bluo di wet laundry stiff pan di line mi decide fi come back home.</p>
<p>One ting did fi do before mi lef, an awkward, unpleasant ting weh perhaps did better fi did let alone. But mi did waan lef tings inna order an not jus trust dat deh obliging an indifferent sea fi sweep mi refuse weh. Mi si Jordan Baker an taak ova an roun weh did happen to wi tugeda, an weh did happen aftawod tu mi, an shi did a lidong perfek stil, a lisn, inna wan big chier.</p>
<p>Shi did dress fi play golf, an mi memba mi did tink seh shi did look like a good illustration, har chin did raise a likkle jauntily, har hair di color a one autumn leaf, har face di same brown tint as di fingerless glove pan har knee. Wen mi did finish she tell mi widout comment seh she did engage to anodda man. Mi did a doubt dat, though deh did have several she coulda married at a nod a har head, but mi pretend fi be surprised. Fi jos a minit mi wanda ef mi neva a mek no mistiek, den mi tingk it aal uova agen kwik-kwik an get op fi se gudbai.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless yuh did throw mi ova,” seh Jordan suddenly. “Yu chruo mi uova pan di telifuon. Mi no gi no damn bout yu nou, bot a did wan nyuu eksperiens fi mi, an mi did fiil likl dizi fi a wail.”</p>
<p>Wi shake han.</p>
<p>“Oh, an yuh memba”—she added—“a conversation we did have once bout driving a car?”</p>
<p>“Why—not exactly.”</p>
<p>“Yuh seh a bad driver was only safe until she meet anodda bad driver? Well, mi meet anodda bad driver, noh true? Mi mean it was careless a mi fi mek such a wrong guess. Mi did tink yuh was rather an honest, straightforward person. Mi did tink seh a yuh secret pride.”</p>
<p>“Mi toti,” mi se. “Mi five years too old fi lie to miself an call it honour.”</p>
<p>Shi neva ansa. Angry, an half inna love wid har, an tremendously sorry, mi turn weh.</p>
<hr/>
<p>One afternoon late inna October mi si Tom Buchanan. Im did a walk ahead a mi along Fifth Avenue inna im alert, aggressive way, im han dem out a likkle fram im body as if fi fight off interference, im head a move sharply yah an deh, a adapt itself to im restless eyes. Jus as mi did a slow up fi avoid overtaking him him stop an staat frown inna di windows a one jewellery store. Suddenly him si mi an walk back, a hold out him han.</p>
<p>“Weh di mata, Nick? Yuh object fi shake han wid mi?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yuh know weh mi tink bout yuh.”</p>
<p>“Yu mad, Nick,” im se kwik-kwik. “Crazy as hell. Mi nuh know weh a gwaan wid yuh.”</p>
<p>“Tom,” mi aks, “we yuh seh tu Wilson da aftanuun de?”</p>
<p>Im did a stare at mi widout a word, an mi did know seh mi did guess right bout dem missing hours deh. Mi staat ton weh, but him tek a step afta mi an grab mi arm.</p>
<p>“Mi tell him di truth,” him seh. “Im come to di door while we did a get ready fi lef, an wen mi sen dung word seh wi neva deh inna him did try fi force him way upstairs. Him did crazy enough fi kill mi if mi neva tell him who own di car. Him han did deh pan a revolver inna him pocket every minute him did deh inna di house—” Him break off defiantly. “Weh if mi did tell him? Dat deh fellow did have it coming to him. Him throw dust inna yuh eyes jus like him did do inna Daisy's, but him was a tough one. Him run ova Myrtle like yuh woulda run ova a dog an neva even stop him car.”</p>
<p>Notn neva deh weh mi coulda seh, except di one ting weh mi neva seh seh it neva true.</p>
<p>“An if yuh tink mi neva have mi share a suffering—look yah, wen mi goh gi up dat deh flat an si dat deh damn box a dog biscuits deh deh pan di sideboard, mi did sidong an cry like a baby. By God it was awful—”</p>
<p>Mi couldn't forgive him or like him, but mi see seh weh him did do was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless an confused. Dem was careless people, Tom an Daisy—dem smash up tings an creatures an den retreat back inna dem money or dem vast carelessness, or whatever it was dat keep dem together, an mek other people clean up di mess dem did mek...</p>
<p>Mi shake han wid him; it did look silly fi nuh, cause mi did feel suddenly as if mi did a talk to a pikni. Den him go inna di jewellery store fi buy a pearl necklace—or maybe only a pair a cuff buttons—rid a mi provincial squeamishness fi eva.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Gatsby ous did stil emti wen mi lef—di graas pan im lan did gruo so lang laik fi mi. One a di taxi drivers inna di village neva tek a fare past di entrance gate widout stop fi a minute an point inside; perhaps a him did drive Daisy an Gatsby ova to East Egg di night a di accident, an perhaps him did mek a story bout it all fi him own. Mi neva waan hear it an mi avoid him wen mi get off di train.</p>
<p>Mi spen mi Saturday nights inna New York cause dem gleaming, dazzling parties a him did deh wid mi so vividly dat mi coulda still hear di music an di laughter, faint an incessant, fram him garden, an di cars dem weh did a go up an dung him drive. One night mi did hear a material car deh, an si it lights stop at him front steps. But mi neva investigate. Probably a did some final guest weh did deh weh a di end a di earth an neva know seh di party did don.</p>
<p>Pan di laas nait, wid mi trunk packed an mi car sel to di grocer, mi go ova an look pan dat deh huge incoherent failure a one house once more. Pan di wait step dem wan obscene wod, scrawled by some bwoy wid a piece a brick, did stan out clearly inna di moonlight, an mi erase it, drawing mi shoe raspingly along di stone. Den mi wander dung to di beach an sprawle out pan di sand.</p>
<p>Most a di big shore places dem did close now an deh neva have no lights except di shadowy, moving glow a one ferryboat across di Sound. An as di moon did a go up higher di inessential house dem staat melt weh til gradually mi staat fi know bout di ole island yah weh did a flower once fi Dutch sailors dem eyes—a fresh, green breast a di new worl. Its vanished trees, di trees dem weh did mek way fi Gatsby's house, did once pandered inna whispers to di last an greatest a all human dreams; fi a transitory enchanted moment man mus have hold him breath inna di presence a dis continent, compeled into an aesthetic contemplation weh him neither andastan or desire, face to face fi di last time inna history wid someting commensurate to him capacity fi wonder.</p>
<p>An as mi did a sidong de a brood pan di uol, anouns worl, mi tingk bout Gatsby wanda wen im fos pik out di griin lait a di en a Daisy dak. Im did come a long way to dis blue lawn, an im dream mosi did look so close dat im coulda hardly fail fi grasp it. Him neva know seh it did deh behind him aredi, somwe back inna dat deh vast obscurity beyond di city, weh di dark fields a di republic did a roll on unda di night.</p>
<p>Gatsby did believe inna di green light, di orgiastic future weh year by year recede before wi. It eluded wi den, but dat's nuh matta—tomorrow wi ago run faster, stretch out wi arms further... An one fine morning—</p>
<p>So wi beat on, boats against di current, borne back ceaselessly inna di past.</p>
