COMMENT ON DI POEM.

Di secret a one poem, no less dan a jest's prosperity, deh inna di ear a him weh hear it. Yield to its spell, accept di poet's mood: dis, afta all, a weh di sages dem ansa wen yuh ask dem bout it value. Even though di poet himself, inna him ada mood, tell yuh seh him art a jus sleight of hand, him food enchanter's food, an offer fi show yuh di trick a it,—no believe him. Wait fi him prophetic hour; den gi yuhself to him passion, him joy or pain. "Wi deh inna Love's han to-day!" sing Gautier, inna Swinburne's buoyant paraphrase,—an fram morn to sunset wi a wafted pan di violent sea: deh deh only one love, one May, one flowery strand. Love is eternal, all else unreal an put aside. Di vision have a end, di scene change; but we have gain someting, di memory a one charm. As many poets, so many charms. Deh deh di charm a Evanescence, dat weh lend to supreme beauty an grace an aureole a Pathos. Share wid Landor him one "night of memories an of sighs" fi Rose Aylmer, an yuh have dis to di full.

An now tek di han a one new-world minstrel, strayed fram some proper habitat to dat deh rude an dissonant America weh, as Baudelaire did si, "a did fi Poe only a vast prison weh him did a run chruu, hither an thither, wid di feverish agitation a one being weh did mek fi breathe inna a purer worl," an weh "im interior life, as spiritual poet, as spiritual as pertupeard one, was drunk effort fi escape di influence a dis antipathetical atmosphere." Clasp di sensitive han a one troubled singer dreeing thus him weird, an share wid him di clime in which him find,—never throughout di day, always inna di night,—if not di Atlantis weh him did wander fram, at least a place a refuge fram di bounds in which by day him did immured.

Tu one lan only him have power fi lead yuh, an fi one night only yuh can share him dream. A tract of neither Earth nor Heaven: "No-man's-land," out of Space, out of Time. Yahso a di perturbed ones, chruu whose eyes, like dem a di Cenci, di soul find windows though di mind is dazed; yah spirits, groping fi di path weh lead to Eternity, get halt an delay. A di limbo a "planetary souls," weh deh all moonlight uncertainties, all lost loves an illusions. Yahso some a dem fix inna trance, di ongl respite attainable; adaz

"move fantastically

To a discordant melody:"

while everyweh deh

"Sheeted Memories of the Past—

Shrouded forms weh staat an sigh

As dem pass di wanderer by."

Such is di lan, an fi one night we enter it,—a night a astral phases an recurrent chimes. Its monodies a twelve poems, whose music strive fi change yet ever is di same. One by one dem sound, like di chiming a di brazen an ebony clock, inna "The Masque of the Red Death," weh mek di waltzers dem pause wid "disconcert an tremulousness an meditation," as often as di hour come round.

Outa all dem mystical cadences, di plaint a The Raven , vibrating thru di portal, chiefly has impress di outer world. Weh tings go to di making a one poem,—an how true inna dis, as in most else, dat deh race weh name dem bards "di makers"? A work is called out a di void. Weh notn neva de, it lef,—a nyuu kriyeshan, paat a di chrezha a mankind. An a few exceptional lyrics, more dan others weh equally creative, compel wi fi tink new how bravely di poet's pen turn tings unknown

"to shapes, an give to airy nutten

A local habitation, an a name."

Each seems widout a prototype, yet all fascinate wi wid elements wrested fram di shadow a di Supernatural. Now di highest imagination concern bout di soul a tings; it may or may not inspire di Fantasy dat peoples wid images di interlunar vague. Stil, one a dem lyrics yah, inna it smaller way, affect wi wid a sense a uniqueness, as surely as di sublimer works a one supernatural cast,—Marlowe's "Faustus," di "Faust" a Goethe, "Manfred," or even dem deh ethereal masterpieces, "The Tempest" an "A Midsummer Dream." More dan one, while otherwise unique, have some  burden or refrain weh haunt di memory,—once heard, neva forget, like di tone a one rarely used but distinctive organ-stop. Notable mongx dem is Bürger's "Lenore," dat deh ghostly an resonant ballad, di lure an foil a di translators. Few ago deny seh Coleridge's wondrous "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" stan a dem very head. "Le Juif-Errant" woulda have claims, if Beranger was a greater poet; an, but fi dem remoteness fram popular sympathy, "The Lady of Shalott" an "The Blessed Damozel" might be added to di list. It did gi Edgar Allan Poe fi produce two lyrics, "The Bells" an The Raven , each a dem, although perhaps a less beauty dan dem a Tennyson an Rossetti, a one unique. "Ulalume," while equally strange an imaginative, nuh have di universal quality weh a part a wi test.

Di Raven inna sheer poetical constituents fall below such pieces as "Di Haunted Palace," "Di City inna di Sea," "Di Sleeper," an "Israfel." Di whole a it woulda be exchange, mi suspect, by readers of a fastidious cast, fi such passages as dem ya:

"Around, by lifting winds forgot,

Resignedly under di sky

Di melancholy waters lie.

No rays fram di holy heaven come dung

Pan di lang nait-taim a dat de toun;

But light fram out di lurid sea

Streams up di turrets silently—

· · · · · · ·

Up many an many a marvelous shrine

Whose wreathéd friezes intertwine

Di viol, di violet, an di vine.

· · · · · · ·

No swellings tell seh winds may be

Pan some far-off happier sea—

No heavings hint seh winds have been

Pan seas less hideously serene."

It lack di aerial melody a di poet whose heart-strings a lute:

"An dem seh (di starry choir

An di ada listening tings)

Dat Israfeli's fire

Is owing to dat lyre

By which him sidong an sing—

Di trembling living wire

A dem unusual strings deh."

But The Raven , like "The Bells" an "Annabel Lee," commend itself to di many an di few. Mi seh elsewhere seh Poe's rarer productions did look like mi "dem in which deh deh di appearance, at least, a spontaneity,—in which him yield to him feelings, while dying falls an cadences most musical, most melancholy, come fram him unawares." Dis a still mi belief; an yet, pan a fresh study a dis poem, it impress mi more dan at any time since mi boyhood. Close acquaintance tell in favor a every true work a art. Induce di man, who neither know art nor care fi it, fi examine some poem or painting, an how soon it force tek hold a him! In fact, him ago overrate di relative value a di first good work by which him attention get fairly catch. Di Raven , also, have consistent qualities weh even an expert haffi admire. Inna no ada a it author's poems di motive more palpably defined. "The Haunted Palace" is jus as definite to di select reader, but Poe scarcely woulda tek dat deh subtle allegory fi bald analysis. Di Raven is wholly occupied wid di author's typical theme—di irretrievable loss a one idolized an beautiful woman; but pan ada grounds, also, di public instinct is correct inna tinkin it him representative poem.

A man of genius usually gain a footing wid di success a some one effort, an dis a nuh always him greatest. Recognition is di more instant fi have been postponed. Him no get it, like a miser's fortune, coin afta coin, but "not at all or all in all." An so wid ada ambitions: di courtier, soldier, actor,—whatever dem parts,—each count dem triumph fram some lucky stroke. Poe's Raven, despite augury, was fi him "di bird weh mek di breeze fi blow." Di poet settle inna New-York, inna di winta a 1844-'45, fi find work pan Willis's paper, "The Evening Mirror," an fi eking out him income by contributions elsewhere. Fi six years him did a one active writer, an him did enjoy a professional reputation; did hold inna both respect an misdoubt, an was at no loss fi him share a di ill-paid journalism a dat deh day. Im did don du nof a im bes wok tu,—laka tuori dem laik "Ligeia" an "Di Faal a di Ous a Usher," (di laas wan we av dat de mistiek kountapaat, ina vors, a Elihu Vedder "A Lost Mind,") laik analitik fiet laik "Di Gold Bug" an "Di Mischri a Marie Roget." Im did mek proselytes abroad, an get a lasting hold pan di French mind. Him did laan him own power an weakness, an him did deh at him prime, an not widout a certain reputation. But him neva write nutten weh did deh pan everybody tongue. Tu rare an delicate work some popular touch haffi be added fi capture di general audience a one's own time.

Thru di industry a Poe's successive biographers, di hit weh The Raven mek don become an oft-told tale. Di poet's young wife, Virginia, did a fade before him eyes, but linger fi anodda year widin death's shadow. Di lang, low chamber inna di house near di Bloomingdale Road is as  famous as di room weh Rouget de l'Isle did compose di Marseillaise. All a dem hear seh di poem, signed "Quarles," did appear inna di "American Review," wid a pseudo-editorial comment pan it form; dat Poe get ten dollars fi it; dat Willis, di kindest an least envious a fashionable arbiters, reprint it wid a eulogy weh instantly mek it town-talk. All doubt bout it authorship did dispelle wen Poe recite it himself at a literary gathering, an fi a time him was di most marked a American authors. Di hit stimulate an encourage him. Like anodda an prouder satirist, him too find "someting a summer" even "inna di hum a insects." Sorrowfully enough, but three years elapsed,—a period a influence, pride, anguish, yet always a imaginative or critical labor,—before di final defeat, before di curtain drop pan a life weh fi him was in truth a tragedy, an him yield to "di Conqueror Worm."

"Di American Review: A Whig Journal" was a creditable magazine fi di time, double-columned, print pan good paper wid clear type, an illustrated by mezzotint portraits. Amid much matter below di present standard, it contain some weh any editor woulda be glad fi receive. Di inishal volyum, fi 1845, ab aatikl bai Horace Greeley, Donald Mitchell, Walter Whitman, Marsh, Tuckerman, an Whipple. Ralph Hoyt's quaint poem, "Old," did appear inna dis volume. An yahso a three lyrics by Poe: "Di City inna di Sea," "Di Valley of Unrest," an The Raven . Two a dem did build up,—such was him way,—frahn earlier studies, but di last-named did come out as if freshly composed, an almost as we have it now. Di statement seh it neva get revise aftaward is erroneous. Eleven trifling changes fram di magazine-text appear inna The Raven and Other Poems , 1845, a book weh di poet shortly feel encouraged fi offer di public. Dis a mostly changes a punctuation, or a single words, di latter kind mek fi heighten di effect a aliteration. Inna Mr. Lang's pretty edition a Poe's verse, weh him bring out inna di "Parchment Library," him did show di instinct a one scholar, an him did do wisely, inna go back to di text inna di volume weh mi jus mention, as dem did gi inna di London issue a 1846. Di "standard" Griswold collection a di poet's works dem full a errors. Dem deh repeat dem by later editors, who also mek errors a dem own. But di text a The Raven , owing to di requests dem weh di author did mek fi manuscript copies, did still farther revise by him; in fact, him print it inna Richmond, jus before him death, wid di poetic substitution a "seraphim whose foot-falls" fi "angels whose faint foot-falls," inna di fourteenth stanza. Wi present text, so, while substantially dat a 1845, is somewhat modified by di poet's later reading, an is, mi tink, di most correct an effective version a dis single poem. Di most radical change fram di earliest version did appear, however, inna di volume inna 1845; di eleventh stanza originally did have dem lines yah, faulty inna rhyme an otherwise a blemish pan di poem:

"Caught fram some unhappy master, whom unmerciful Disaster

Follow fast an follow faster—so, wen Hope him woulda adjure,

Stern Despair come back, instead a di sweet Hope weh him did a dare adjure—

Dat deh sad ansa, 'Nevermore!'"

It woulda be well if other, an famous, poets coulda be as sure of mek dem changes always improvements. Poe constantly rehandle him scanty show a verse, an usually better it. Di Raven was di first a di few poems weh him nearly bring to completion before him print. It may be dat dem who care fi poetry lost likkle by him death. Fluent in prose, him neva write verse fi di sake a mek a poem. Wen a refrain a image haunted him, di lyric weh did come out was di inspiration, as him himself seh, a one passion, not a purpose. Dis was at intervals so rare as almost fi justify di Fairfield theory dat each was di product a one nervous crisis.

Weh, den, gi di poet him clue to The Raven ? Fram weh misty foundation it rise slowly to a music slowly breathed? As usual, more dan one ting did go to di building a so notable a poem. Considering di longer sermons often preached pan brief an less suggestive texts, mi hope not fi be blamed fi dis discussion of a single lyric,—especially one weh an artist like Doré mek di subject a prodigal illustration. Til recently mi did suppose seh dis piece, an a few weh di author did compose afta it appear, did exceptional inna not have grown fram germs inna him boyish verse. But Mr. Fearing Gill did show mi some unpublished stanzas by Poe, written inna him eighteenth year, an entitled, "The Demon of the Fire." Di manuscript look like it deh inna di poet's early handwriting, an it genuineness is vouched fi by di family inna whose possession it have remained fi half a century. Besides di plainest germs a "The Bells" an "The Haunted Palace" it contain a few lines somewhat suggestive a di opening an close a The Raven . As to di rhythm a wi poem, a comparison a dates indicate seh dis was influenced by di rhythm a "Lady Geraldine's Courtship." Poe was one a di first fi honor Miss Barrett's genius; him inscribe him collected poems to har as "di noblest a har sex," an him did inna  sympathy wid har lyrical method. Di lines dem fram har love-poem,

"Wid a murmurous stir uncertain, inna di air, di purple curtain

Swelth in an swelth out roun har motionless pale brows,"

find an echo inna dem ya:

"An di silken sad uncertain rustling a each purple curtain

Thrilled mi—fill mi wid fantastic terrors neva feel before."

Yahso Poe tek a privilege fi weh him roughly censure Longfellow, an weh nobadi neva eva saach fi pan him own premises widout swift detection an chastisement. Inna melody an stanzaic form, wi shall see seh di two poems dem no unlike, but inna motive dem totally distinct. Di generous poetess neva feel notn but di true originality a di poet. "Dis vivid writing!" she exclaimed,—"dis power weh yuh feel!... Our great poet, Mr. Browning, author a 'Paracelsus,' &c., is enthusiastic inna him admiration a di rhythm." Mr. Ingram, afta him did a refer to "Lady Geraldine," cleverly point out anodda source weh Poe maita did ketch an impulse fram. Inna 1843, Albert Pike, di half-Greek, half-frontiersman, poet a Arkansas, did print inna "The New Mirror," fi weh Poe did a write, some verses weh dem did call "Isadore," but since di author did a revise it an dem did call it "The Widowed Heart." Mi select fram Mr. Pike's revision di following stanza, weh di main features dem correspond wid di original version:

"Restless mi pace wi lonely rooms, mi play wi songs no more,

Di garish sun shine flauntingly pan di unswept floor;

Di mocking-bird still sidong an sing, O melancholy strain!

For mi heart a like a autumn-cloud weh overflow wid rain;

Yuh lost to mi fi eva, Isadore!"

Yahso wi have a prolonged measure, a similarity a refrain, an di introduction a one bird weh song enhance sorrow. Deh deh ada trails weh di curious dem may follow; notably, a passage weh Mr. Ingram select fram Poe's final review a "Barnaby Rudge":

"Di raven, too, * * * maita wehn mek, muor dan wi si it nou, a paat a di kansepshan a di fantastik Barnaby. * * * Its karakta maita wehn pofaam, ina rigard tu dat a di idiot, muos di siem paat az du, ina myuuzik, di akompniment ina rispek tu di ier."

Nevertheless, afta mi point out dem germs an resemblances yah, di value a dis poem still deh inna it originality. Di progressive music, di scenic detail an contrasted light an shade,—above all, di spiritual passion a di nocturn, mek it di work a one informing genius. As fi di gruesome bird, him no like all di ada ravens dem a him clan, fram di "twa corbies" an "three ravens" a di balladists to Barnaby's rumpled "Grip." No semblance a di cawing rook weh haunt ancestral turrets an tread di field a heraldry; no boding phantom of which Tickell sing dat, wen,

"shrieking at har window thrice,

Di raven flap'd him wing,

Too well di love-lorn maiden did know

Di solemn boding sound."

Poe's raven a one distinct conception; di incarnation a one mourner's agony an hopelessness; a sable embodied Memory, di abiding chronicler a doom, a type a di Irreparable. Escaped across di Styx, fram "di Night's Plutonian shore," him seems di imaged soul a di questioner himself,—a him who can't, will not, quaff di kind nepenthe, cause di memory a Lenore a all weh lef him, an wid di surcease a him sorrow even dat woulda be put aside.

Di Raven maita tek az a riprisentant puoym a di aata, fi di egzampl a aal a im nuoshan a wa wahn puoym shuda bi. Dis deh inna him essays pan "Di Poetic Principle," "Di Rationale a Verse," an "Di Philosophy a Composition." Poe declare seh "inna Music, perhaps, di soul most nearly attains di great end fi which, wen it inspired by di Poetic Sentiment, it struggle—di creation a supernal Beauty.... Verse cyaan be better designated dan as an inferior or less capable music"; but again, verse weh a really di "Poetry of Words" a "The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty,"—dis ​​an notn more. Di tone a di highest Beauty a one a Sadness. Di most melancholy a di topics dem a Death. Dis haffi be allied to Beauty. "Di det, den, a one beautiful woman a, unquestionably, di most poetical topic inna di worl,—an equally is it beyond doubt dat di lips dem weh bes suit fi such a topic a dem a one bereaved lover." Dem last expressions deh quote fram Poe's whimsical analysis a dis very poem, but dem indicate precisely di general range a him verse. Di climax a "The Bells" a di muffled monotone a ghouls, weh glory inna weighing dung di human heart. "Lenore," The Raven , "The Sleeper," "To One in Paradise," an "Ulalume" form a tenebrose symphony,—an "Annabel Lee," write last a all, show seh one theme did possess him to di end. Again, dem a all nutten if not musical, an some a dem touch wid dat deh quality a di Fantastic weh awake di sense a awe, an add a new fear to agony itself. Thru all is dimly outlined, beath a shadowy pall, di poet's ideal love,—so often half-portrayed elsewhere,—di entombed wife a Usher, di Lady Ligeia, inna  truth di counterpart a him own nature. Mi suppose seh an artist's love fi one "in di form" neva can wholly rival him devotion to some ideal. Di uman weh deh nier him haffi exercise har spells, be all by turns an notn long, charm him wid infinite variety, or be content fi forego a share a him allegiance. Him haffi be lured by di Unattainable, an dis is ever jus beyond him inna him passion fi creative art.

Poe, like Hawthorne, come in wid di decline a di Romantic school, an none neva delight more dan him fi laugh at its calamity. Yet him heart did deh wid di romancers an dem Oriental or Gothic effects. Him invention, so rich inna di prose tales, did look like it did desert him wen him did a write verse; an him judgment tell him seh long romantic poems depend more pan incident dan inspiration,—an dat, fi utter di poetry a romance, lyrics woulda suffice. So him theory, weh clearly fit to him own limitations, seh "a 'long poem' a one flat contradiction inna terms." Di components dem a The Raven a few an simple: a man, a bird, an di phantasmal memory at a woman. But di piece afford a fine display a romantic material. Weh wi have? Di midnight; di shadowy chamber wid it tomes a forgotten lore; di student,—a modern Hieronymus; di raven's tap pan di casement; di winta nait an di faiya we a ded; di silken wind-swept hangings; di dreams an vague mistrust a di echoing darkness; di black, uncanny bird pan di pallid bust; di accessories a violet velvet an di gloating lamp. All dis stage effect a situation, light, color, sound, is purely romantic, an even melodramatic, but a poetic quality weh melodrama rarely exhibit, an thoroughly reflective a di poet's "eternal passion, eternal pain."

Di rhythmic structure a The Raven did sure fi mek an impression. Rhyme, alliteration, di burden, di stanzaic form, did devised wid singular adroitness. Doubtless di poet did struck wid di aptness a Miss Barrett's musical trochaics, inna "eights," an especially by di arrangement adopted near di close a "Lady Geraldine":

"'Eyes,' him seh, 'now throbbing through mi! A yuh eyes weh did undo mi?

Shining eyes, like antique jewels set inna Parian statue-stone!

Anda dat deh calm white forehead, yuh eva a burn torrid

O'er di desolate sand-desert a mi heart an life undone?'"

Him artistic introduction a one third rhyme inna di secan an fourth lines, an di addition a one fifth line an a final refrain, mek di stanza a The Raven . Di persistent aliteration seem fi come widout effort, an often di rhymes widin lines dem seductive; while di refrain or burden dominate di whole work. Yahso him did profit fram Miss Barrett's study a ballads an romaunts inna har own an ada tongues. A "refrain" a di lure weh a poet or a musician hold di wandering ear,—di recurrent longing a Nature fi di initial strain. Mi always admire di beautiful refrains a di English songstress,—"The Nightingales, di Nightingales," "Margret, Margret," "My Heart and I," "Toll slowly," "The River floweth on," "Pan, Pan is dead," etc. Shi also employ weh mi call di Repetend, inna di use a Poece thus revill all Colleri poet e:

"O happy living tings! no tongue

Dem beauty might declare:

A spring a love gushed fram mi heart,

An mi neva nuo se mi bles dem.

Sure mi kind saint tek pity pan mi,

An mi bles dem widout mi know."

Poe mek di fifth line a him stanza fi di magic a di repetend. Im did rely pan it to di uttermost inna a few later poems,—"Lenore," "Annabel Lee," "Ulalume," an "For Annie." It gain a wild an melancholy music, mi did tink, fram di "sweet influences," a di Afric burdens an repetends dem weh dem did sing to him inna him childhood, attuning wid dem native melody di voice a wi Southern poet.

"Di Philosophy of Composition," him analysis a The Raven , a one technical disection a it method an structure. Neither him avowal a cold-blooded artifice, nor him subsequent avowal to frens seh an exposure a dis artifice was only anodda a him intellectual hoaxes, need fi be wholly credited. If him did design di complete work in advance, him scarcely woulda mek so harsh a prelude a rattle-pan rhymes to di delicious melody a di secan stanza,—not even upon him theory of di fantastic. Aal av a sudden wan artist, afta im perfek wan wok, si, laik di fos Artist, se it gud, an si wa mek it gud. A subsequent analysis, coupled wid a disavowal a any sacred fire, readily enough may be made. Mi belief is dat di first conception an rough draft a dis poem come as inspiration always come; dat di author den si how it might be perfected, gi it di final touches dem weh im did describe inna im chapter pan Composition, an dat di latter, therefore, a nuh wholly false nor wholly true. Di harm a such analysis is dat it tempt a novice fi fancy seh artificial processes can supersede imagination. Di impulse a genius is fi guard di secrets a it creative hour. Glimpses obtained of di toil, di baffled experiments, weh precede a triumph, as inna di sketch-work a Hawthorne recently bring to light, afford priceless instruction an encouragement to di sincere artist. But one  who voluntarily expose him Muse to di gaze a all comers shuda recall di fate a King Candaules.

Di worl still tink bout Poe as a "luckless man of genius." Mi recently hear him mention as "one whom everybody seems chartered fi misrepresent, decry or slander." But it look like mi seh him ill-luck did end wid him pitiable death, an dat since den him defense did persistent, an him fame a as steadfast growth as a suffering an gifted author coulda pray fi inna him hopeful hour. Griswold's decrial an slander turn di current inna him favor. Critics an biographers come forward wid successive refutations, wid tributes to him character, wid new editions a him works. Him own letta dem an di minute incidents a him career deh before wi; di record, good an bad, is widely known. No appellor neva get more tender an forgiving judgement. Him mishaps inna life belong to him region an period, perchance still more to him own infirmity of will. Doubtless him environment neva one fi guard a fine-grained, ill-balanced nature fram perils widout an widin. Him strongest will, fi be lord a himself, gain fi him "dat heritage of woe." Im confess imself di bird's unhappy master, di stricken sufferer a dis poem. But him was a full share a dat deh dramatic temper weh exults inna di presage a it own doom. A wan delight inna playing one's high part: wi all gladiators, crying Ave Imperator! Fi quote Burke's matter of fact: "Inna grief di pleasure still deh uppermost, an di affliction we suffer no have no resemblance to absolute pain, weh always odious, an weh wi endeavor fi shake off as soon as possible." Poe go farther, an was an artist even inna di tragedy a him career. If, according to him own belief, sadness an di vanishing a beauty a di highest poetic themes, an poetic feeling di keenest earthly pleasure, den di sorrow an darkness a him broken life neva did widout dem frequent compensation.

Inna di following pages, wi have a fresh example a one artist's genius weh characterize him interpretation a one famous poem. Gustave Doré, di laas work a whose pencil deh before wi, neva di painter, or even di draughtsman, fi realists weh did a demand truth a tone, figure, an perfection. Dem deh ting deh concern him less dan fi mek shape an distance, light an shade, assist him purpose,—we was fi excite di soul, di imagination, a di looker pan. Dis him did do by arousing wi sense a awe, chruu marvelous an often sublime conceptions a tings unuttable an full a gloom or glory. It well seh dat if him works dem neva great paintings, as pictures dem great indeed. As a "literary artist," an such him was, him force was in direct ratio wid di dramatic invention a him author, wid di brave audacities a di spirit weh kindle him own. So him success wid Rabelais, wid "Le Juif-Errant," "Les Contes Drolatiques," an "Don Quixote," an hence, conversely, him fail fi express di beauty a Tennyson's Idyls, a "Il Paradiso," a di Hebrew pastorals, an ada text dem weh require exaltation, or sweetness an repose. Im was a born master a di grotesque, an by a special insight coulda portray di specters a one haunted brain. Wi si objects as him personages did si dem, an wid di very eyes a di Wandering Jew, di bewildered Don, or di goldsmith's daughta whose fancy so magnify di King inna di shop pan di Pont-au-Change. A did inna di nature a tings weh him shuda be attracted to each masterpiece a verse or prose weh mi did call unique. Di lower kingdoms dem did get call inna him service; him rocks, trees an mountains, di sky itself, dem animate wid motive an diablerie. If him did live fi illustrate Shakespeare, wi shuda did si a remarkable treatment a Caliban, di Witches, di storm inna "Lear"; but doubtless shuda did question him ideals a Imogen or Miranda. Beauty pure an simple, an di perfect excellence it, him rarely seemed fi comprehend.

Yet deh have beauty inna him designs fi di "Ancient Mariner," unreal as dem deh, an a consecutiveness rare inna a series by Doré. Di Rime gi him a prolonged story, wid plenty shiftings a di scene. Inna The Raven sound an color preserve dem monotone an wi have no change a place or occasion. Weh a di result? Doré proffers a series a variations pan di theme as him did conceive it, "di enigma a death an di hallucination a one inconsolable soul." Inna some a dem drawing yah him faults dem evident; adaz reveal him powerful originality, an di bes qualities in which, as a draughtsman, him did stan alone. Plainly deh did have someting in common between di working moods a Poe an Doré. Dis woulda appear more clearly if di latta did try him han pan di "Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque." Both resorted often to di elf-land a fantasy an romance. Inna melodramatic feats dem both, chruu dem command a di supernatural, avoid di danger-line between di ideal an di absurd. Poe was di truer worshiper a di Beautiful; him love fi it was a consecrating passion, an herein him part company wid him illustrator. Poet or artist, Death at last transfigures all: widin di shadow a him sable harbinger, Vedder's symbolic crayon aptly set dem face to face, but enfold dem wid di mantle a immortal wisdom an power. Wan American woman have wrought di image a one star-eyed Genius wid di final torch, di exquisite semblance a one whose vision beholds, but whose lips may not utter, di mysteries a one lan beyond "di door a one legend tomb."

DI POEM.

Illustration 1

DI RAVEN.

Once upon a midnight dreary, while mi pondered, weak an weary,

Ova many a quaint an curious volume a forgetten lore,

While mi did a nod, nearly napping, suddenly deh come a tapping,

As of some one gently rapping, rapping at mi chamber door.

"'T a some visitor," mi muttered, "tapping at mi chamber door—

Only dis, an notn more."

Ah, distinctly mi memba it was inna di bleak December,

An each separate dying ember wrought it ghost pan di floor.

Eagerly mi wish di morrow:—vainly mi did a try fi borrow

Fram mi books surcease a sorrow—sorrow fi di lost Lenore—

Fi di rare an radiant maiden weh di angels dem name Lenore—

Nameless yah fi evermore.

An di silken sad uncertain rustling a each purple curtain

Thrilled mi—fill mi wid fantastic terrors neva feel before;

So dat now, fi still di beating a mi heart, mi did a repeat

"'T a some visiter a beg fi come inna mi chamber door

Some late visiter a beg fi come inna mi chamber door;—

Dis a it, an notn muor."

Presently mi soul did a grow stronger; hesitating den no longer,

"Sir," mi seh, "or Madam, truly yuh forgiveness mi implore;

But di fact is mi did a nap, an so gently yuh come a rap,

An so faintly yuh come tapping, tapping at mi chamber door,

Dat mi scarce was sure mi hear yuh"—yahso mi open wide di door;—

Darkness deh, an nutten more.

Deep inna dat deh darkness peering, long mi stan deh a wanda, a fraid,

Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal eva dare fi dream before;

But di silence neva break, an di darkness did a gi no token,

An di ongl wod weh dem did a seh was di whispered wod, "Lenore!"

Dis mi whisper, an an echo murmured back di wod, "Lenore!"

Merely dis an notn more.

Back inna di chamber turning, all mi soul widin mi burning,

Soon again mi hear a tapping, likkle louder dan before.

"Surely," mi seh, "surely dat a someting at mi window lattice;

Mek mi si, den, weh deh deh, an dis mystery explore—

Mek mi heart be still a moment an dis mystery explore;—

'T a di wind an notn more!"

Open yah mi fling di shutter, wen, wid many a flirt an flutter,

In deh step a stately Raven a di saintly days a yore.

Not di least obeisance him mek; not a minute stop or stay him;

But, wid mien a lord or lady, perched above mi chamber door—

Perched upon a bust a Pallas jus above mi chamber door—

Sidong, an sidong, an notn muor.

Den dis ebony bird beguiling mi sad fancy fi smile,

By di grave an stern decorum a di countenance it wear,

"Though yuh crest get shave an shave, yuh," mi seh, "art sure no craven,

Ghastly grim an ancient Raven wandering fram di Nightly shore,—

Tell mi weh yuh lordly name is pan di Night's Plutonian shore!"

Quoth di Raven, "Nevermore."

Much mi marveled dis ungainly fowl fi hear discourse so plainly,

Though it ansa likkle meaning—likl relevancy bore;

Kaaz wi kyaahn elp fi grii se no livin yuuman biin

Ever yet was blessed wid seeing bird above him chamber door—

Bird or beast pan di sculptured bust above him chamber door,

Wid such name as "Nevermore."

But di Raven, weh did a sidong lonely pan di placid bust, did a taak ongl

Dat deh one word, as if him soul inna dat deh one word him did outpour.

Notn further den him seh—not a feather den him flutter—

Til mi scarcely more dan muttered, "Other frens have fly before—

Pan di more day him ago lef mi, as mi hopes dem did fly before."

Den di bird seh, "Nevermore."

Startled at di stillness weh break by reply so aptly spoken,

"Doubtless," seh mi, "weh it seh a it only stock an store,

Kech fram some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster

Follow fast an follow faster til him songs one burden bore—

Til di dirges a him Hope dat melancholy burden bore

A 'Neva—nevamore.'"

But di Raven still a beguiling all mi sad soul fi smile,

Straight mi wheel a cushioned seat in front a bird an bust an door;

Den, pan di velvet sinking, mi betok miself to linking

Fancy unto fancy, tinkin weh dis ominous bird of yore—

Weh dis grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt an ominous bird of yore

Meant in croaking "Nevermore."

Dis mi sidong a gues, but no syllable express

Tu di fowl whose fiery eyes now burn inna mi bosom's core;

Dis an more mi did sidong a divine, wid mi head at ease reclining

Pan di cushion's velvet lining weh di lamplight gloate o'er,

But whose velvet violet lining wid di lamplight gloating o'er

Shi a go press, ah, neva more!

Den, mi did tink, di air did a grow denser, perfumed fram an unseen censer

Swing by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled pan di tufted floor.

"Wretch," mi baal out, "yuh God lent yuh—by dem angel yah him sen yuh

Respite—respite an nepenthe fram yuh memories a Lenore!

Quaff, oh quaff dis kind nepenthe, an forget dis lost Lenore!"

Quoth di Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet!" seh mi, "ting a evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—

Ef Tempta sen yu, ar ef di chrang chrang chruo yu ya-so,

Desolate yet all undaunted, pan dis desert lan enchanted—

Pan dis home by Horror haunted—tel mi truly, mi implore—

Is deh— is deh balm inna Gilead?—tel mi—tel mi, mi a beg!"

Quoth di Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet!" mi seh, "ting a evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!

By dat deh Heaven weh bends above, wi—by dat deh God we both adore—

Tell dis soul wid sorrow laden if, widin di distant Aidenn,

It ago clasp a sainted maiden weh di angels dem name Lenore—

Clasp a rare an radiant maiden weh di angels dem name Lenore."

Quoth di Raven, "Nevermore."

"Be dat deh word deh wi sign a parting, bird or fiend!" Mi shriek, upstarting—

"Get yuh back inna di tempest an di Night's Plutonian shore!

No lef no black plume as a token a dat deh lie weh yuh soul did a seh!

Lef mi loneliness unbroken!—quit di bust above mi door!

Tek yuh beak fram out mi heart, an tek yuh form fram off mi door!"

Quoth di Raven, "Nevermore."

An di Raven, neva flitting, still a sidong, still a sidong

Pan di pallid bust a Pallas jus above mi chamber door;

An im yai dem luk laik wan diiman yai we a driim;

An di lamplight o'er him streaming throw him shadow pan di floor;

An mi soul fram out dat deh shadow weh lay a float pan di floor

Shall be lifted—nevermore!
