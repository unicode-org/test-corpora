Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore."


Illustration 4


"Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor."


Illustration 5


"Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore."


Illustration 6


"Sorrow for the lost Lenore."


Illustration 7


"For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Nameless here for evermore."


Illustration 8


"'T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door."

"Here I opened wide the door;—
Darkness there, and nothing more."


Illustration 10


"Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before."


Illustration 11

Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore.'"

. . . . . . . . "A stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he."

"Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
Perched, and sat, and nothing more."


Illustration 15


"Wandering from the Nightly shore."


Illustration 16


"Till I scarcely more than muttered, 'Other friends have flown before—
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'"


Illustration 17


"Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy."


Illustration 18


"But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er
She shall press, ah, nevermore!"


Illustration 19


"'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!'"


Illustration 20


"On this home by Horror haunted."


Illustration 21


. . . . . . . . . "Tell me truly, I implore—
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!"

"Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore."


Illustration 23

Illustration 24


"'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!'"


Illustration 25


"And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted—nevermore!"
