Chapter XIII<br/>
How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome</h2>
<p>
How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview! But she had always
rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a
right to assume. Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout
of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay
wounded over the sunlit earth? She had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might
be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent. She was prepared for all
of these. But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with
the shout of the morning star.
</p>
<p>
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she reflected that
it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is
impossible to rehearse life. A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an
irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned
gestures mean nothing, or mean too much. “I will bow,” she had thought. “I will
not shake hands with him. That will be just the proper thing.” She had
bowed—but to whom? To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls!
She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world.
</p>
<p>
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil. It was another
of those dreadful engagement calls. Mrs. Butterworth had wanted to see him, and
he did not want to be seen. He did not want to hear about hydrangeas, why they
change their colour at the seaside. He did not want to join the C. O. S. When
cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where “Yes” or
“No” would have done. Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a
way that promised well for their married peace. No one is perfect, and surely
it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock. Miss Bartlett,
indeed, though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains
nothing satisfactory. Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the
teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
</p>
<p>
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter with
Cecil?”
</p>
<p>
The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with charity
and restraint.
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he’s tired.”
</p>
<p>
Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
</p>
<p>
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering
displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.”
</p>
<p>
“I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.”
</p>
<p>
“Cecil has told you to think so. You were devoted to her as a little girl, and
nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.
No—it is just the same thing everywhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?”
</p>
<p>
“Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?”
</p>
<p>
“Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing trouble
ahead. “It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes him
sometimes seem—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, rubbish! If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets rid of
them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
</p>
<p>
“Now, mother! I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!”
</p>
<p>
“Not in that way. At times I could wring her neck. But not in that way. No. It
is the same with Cecil all over.”
</p>
<p>
“By-the-by—I never told you. I had a letter from Charlotte while I was
away in London.”
</p>
<p>
This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs. Honeychurch
resented it.
</p>
<p>
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him. Whenever I
speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to contradict me. No
doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I
cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put
up with it, will Cecil kindly remember.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to. But he does not
mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the <i>things</i> that
upset him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to
<i>people</i>.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do.”
</p>
<p>
“Then why didn’t he leave the room? Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling
everyone’s pleasure?”
</p>
<p>
“We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy. Something had enfeebled her,
and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so perfectly in London, would
not come forth in an effective form. The two civilizations had
clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was dazzled and
bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had
blinded her eyes. Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords, garments of
diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees, where
the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.
</p>
<p>
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her frock
for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made things no better.
There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to be supercilious, and he
had succeeded. And Lucy—she knew not why—wished that the trouble
could have come at any other time.
</p>
<p>
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, mother—”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop. Go.”
</p>
<p>
She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window. It faced north,
so there was little view, and no view of the sky. Now, as in the winter, the
pine-trees hung close to her eyes. One connected the landing window with
depression. No definite problem menaced her, but she sighed to herself, “Oh,
dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to her that everyone else
was behaving very badly. And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s
letter. She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might
have asked what it was about. Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then
Freddy came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
</p>
<p>
“I say, those are topping people.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been! You have no business to take them
bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public. It was all right for you but
most awkward for everyone else. Do be more careful. You forget the place is
growing half suburban.”
</p>
<p>
“I say, is anything on to-morrow week?”
</p>
<p>
“Not that I know of.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this muddle.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s wrong with the court? They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve ordered
new balls.”
</p>
<p>
“I meant <i>it’s</i> better not. I really mean it.”
</p>
<p>
He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage.
She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with temper. Cecil
glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her
brood of hot-water cans. Then Mrs. Honeychurch opened her door and said: “Lucy,
what a noise you’re making! I have something to say to you. Did you say you had
had a letter from Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I really can’t stop. I must dress too.”
</p>
<p>
“How’s Charlotte?”
</p>
<p>
“All right.”
</p>
<p>
“Lucy!”
</p>
<p>
The unfortunate girl returned.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences. Did
Charlotte mention her boiler?”
</p>
<p>
“Her <i>what?</i>”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath
cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly. “I shall have
enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out. She did not. She said: “Come here, old
lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And, though
nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner
and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
</p>
<p>
So the grittiness went out of life. It generally did at Windy Corner. At the
last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or
other of the family poured in a drop of oil. Cecil despised their
methods—perhaps rightly. At all events, they were not his own.
</p>
<p>
Dinner was at half-past seven. Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew up their
heavy chairs and fell to. Fortunately, the men were hungry. Nothing untoward
occurred until the pudding. Then Freddy said:
</p>
<p>
“Lucy, what’s Emerson like?”
</p>
<p>
“I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a reply.
</p>
<p>
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?”
</p>
<p>
“Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.”
</p>
<p>
“He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
</p>
<p>
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, very slightly. I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her
letter.”
</p>
<p>
“One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get through the
meal without a lie. “Among other things, that an awful friend of hers had been
bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if she’d come up and see us, and
mercifully didn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.”
</p>
<p>
“She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily. The remark was a happy one, for
nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females.
She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who (instead of
minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety by print. Her attitude
was: “If books must be written, let them be written by men”; and she developed
it at great length, while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next
year, now, never,” with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of
her mother’s wrath. But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began
to gather in the darkness. There were too many ghosts about. The original
ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long
ago; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr. Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter,
Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was bound to
haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes. It was Miss Bartlett who returned now, and
with appalling vividness.
</p>
<p>
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s. How is she?”
</p>
<p>
“I tore the thing up.”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t she say how she was? How does she sound? Cheerful?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, depend upon it, it <i>is</i> the boiler. I know myself how water preys
upon one’s mind. I would rather anything else—even a misfortune with the
meat.”
</p>
<p>
Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the
spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
</p>
<p>
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we could
squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while the
plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish. I have not seen poor Charlotte for so
long.”
</p>
<p>
It was more than her nerves could stand. And she could not protest violently
after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
</p>
<p>
“Mother, no!” she pleaded. “It’s impossible. We can’t have Charlotte on the top
of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is. Freddy’s got a friend
coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe
because of the diphtheria scare. It simply can’t be done.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! It can.”
</p>
<p>
“If Minnie sleeps in the bath. Not otherwise.”
</p>
<p>
“Minnie can sleep with you.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t have her.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again laying his
hand over his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy. “I don’t want to make difficulties, but it
really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.”
</p>
<p>
Alas!
</p>
<p>
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t. And no more does Cecil. She gets on our nerves. You haven’t seen
her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be, though so good. So
please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her
to come.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling than she
usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of you two. You have
each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of beautiful things; and
poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers. You are young,
dears, and however clever young people are, and however many books they read,
they will never guess what it feels like to grow old.”
</p>
<p>
Cecil crumbled his bread.
</p>
<p>
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my
bike,” put in Freddy. “She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool,
and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.”
</p>
<p>
“I know, dear. She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when
we try to give her some little return.”
</p>
<p>
But Lucy hardened her heart. It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett. She
had tried herself too often and too recently. One might lay up treasure in
heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else
upon earth. She was reduced to saying: “I can’t help it, mother. I don’t like
Charlotte. I admit it’s horrid of me.”
</p>
<p>
“From your own account, you told her as much.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly. She flurried—”
</p>
<p>
The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping the
places she had known as a child. The Sacred Lake would never be the same again,
and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy Corner. How would she
fight against ghosts? For a moment the visible world faded away, and memories
and emotions alone seemed real.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said Cecil,
who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the admirable cooking.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t mean the egg was <i>well</i> boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because in
point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don’t care
for eggs. I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.”
</p>
<p>
Cecil frowned again. Oh, these Honeychurches! Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas,
maids—of such were their lives compact. “May me and Lucy get down from
our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence. “We don’t want no
dessert.”
