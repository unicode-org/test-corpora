Chapter I<br/>
The Bertolini</h2>
<p>
“The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at
all. She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which
here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart. Oh,
Lucy!”
</p>
<p>
“And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the
Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at the two rows
of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of
water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the
portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the
English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London? I can hardly
believe that all kinds of other things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s
being so tired.”
</p>
<p>
“This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her
fork.
</p>
<p>
“I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter
would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!”
</p>
<p>
“Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that
you shouldn’t have a view.”
</p>
<p>
Lucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of
course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first vacant room
in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose
travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to
which she made many a tactful allusion.
</p>
<p>
“No, no. You must have it.”
</p>
<p>
“I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”
</p>
<p>
“She would never forgive <i>me</i>.”
</p>
<p>
The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a
little peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they
wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of
them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant
forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He said:
</p>
<p>
“I have a view, I have a view.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them over for
a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do”
till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she
glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and
large eyes. There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the
childishness of senility. What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to
consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the
swim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A
view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”
</p>
<p>
“This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view too.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
</p>
<p>
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have
yours. We’ll change.”
</p>
<p>
The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the
new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible,
and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
</p>
<p>
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”
</p>
<p>
“You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again repressed
her.
</p>
<p>
“But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he
thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying,
“George, persuade them!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s nothing
else to say.”
</p>
<p>
He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and
sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is
known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these
ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not
with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different,
whose existence she had not realized before. Now the old man attacked Miss
Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change? What possible objection
had she? They would clear out in half an hour.
</p>
<p>
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless
in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any one so gross. Her
face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as much as to say, “Are you
all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the
table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly
indicating “We are not; we are genteel.”
</p>
<p>
“Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat
that she had once censured.
</p>
<p>
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
</p>
<p>
“Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will make a
change.”
</p>
<p>
Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The curtains
at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive,
who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for
his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet,
exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s Mr. Beebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh,
Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are. Oh!”
</p>
<p>
Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint:
</p>
<p>
“How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett
and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of
St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”
</p>
<p>
The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies
quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward pleasantly enough
and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
</p>
<p>
“I <i>am</i> so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of
spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin
had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer Street, too, makes
it so specially funny.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett,
filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation
that you have just accepted the living—”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t know that I knew you at
Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe is—’”
</p>
<p>
“Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer Street
next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
</p>
<p>
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get
him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”
</p>
<p>
“Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.”
</p>
<p>
He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss
Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the girl whether she
knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been
there before. It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the
field. “Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded. “The first fine
afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that
sort.”
</p>
<p>
“No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are wrong. The
first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”
</p>
<p>
“That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We are in
luck.”
</p>
<p>
And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People told them
what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of
the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would
grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically,
that they would do. Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted
at them. And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato! They
must go to Prato. That place is too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I
revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.”
</p>
<p>
The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned
moodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do. Lucy, in the
midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave her no extra
pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she
turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
</p>
<p>
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by
raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
</p>
<p>
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the
curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more
than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to
her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her
daughter. It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey
the grace and geniality of the South. And even more curious was the
drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury
boarding-house. Was this really Italy?
</p>
<p>
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the
colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she
spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as
though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle. “We are most grateful to
you,” she was saying. “The first evening means so much. When you arrived we
were in for a peculiarly <i>mauvais quart d’heure</i>.”
</p>
<p>
He expressed his regret.
</p>
<p>
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at
dinner?”
</p>
<p>
“Emerson.”
</p>
<p>
“Is he a friend of yours?”
</p>
<p>
“We are friendly—as one is in pensions.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will say no more.”
</p>
<p>
He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
</p>
<p>
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and
it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom
we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate. I hope I acted for the
best.”
</p>
<p>
“You acted very naturally,” said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after a few
moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of
accepting.”
</p>
<p>
“No <i>harm</i>, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.”
</p>
<p>
“He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I
think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show
gratitude. He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he
means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them. He
no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being
polite. It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to
understand people who speak the truth.”
</p>
<p>
Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope
that people will be nice.”
</p>
<p>
“I think he is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him on almost every point of
any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When he first came
here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up. He has no tact and no
manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will
not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about him to our
depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the
lips.
</p>
<p>
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?”
</p>
<p>
“I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet. He seems a nice
creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his father’s
mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett. “So you think I ought to have
accepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.”
</p>
<p>
“But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?”
</p>
<p>
He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got
up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
</p>
<p>
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. “Why didn’t
you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I’m sure. I do hope I haven’t
monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all
dinner-time.”
</p>
<p>
“He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy. “Just what I remember. He seems to see good in
everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear Lucia—”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr.
Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.”
</p>
<p>
“Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will approve
of Mr. Beebe.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.”
</p>
<p>
“I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world. I
am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
</p>
<p>
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of
herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of
the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine. She tried to
locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss Bartlett sedulously denied
disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very
depressing companion.”
</p>
<p>
And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more
careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.”
</p>
<p>
Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling
very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where
Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy,
the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the
improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room
windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of
attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was
proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real
catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had
found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better
than something else.
</p>
<p>
“But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so English.”
</p>
<p>
“Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy. “We dread going to bed.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed. “If only Mr. Emerson was more
tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“I think he was meaning to be kind.”
</p>
<p>
“Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of course, I was
holding back on my cousin’s account.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be
too careful with a young girl.
</p>
<p>
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No one was
careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
</p>
<p>
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have
you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate,
and yet at the same time—beautiful?”
</p>
<p>
“Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. “Are not beauty and
delicacy the same?”
</p>
<p>
“So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly. “But things are so
difficult, I sometimes think.”
</p>
<p>
She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking
extremely pleasant.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms. I’m so glad. Mr.
Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I
encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me come and ask you. He
would be so pleased.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now. The old
man is just as nice and kind as he can be.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Bartlett was silent.
</p>
<p>
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious. I must
apologize for my interference.”
</p>
<p>
Gravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My
own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours. It would be
hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only
here through your kindness. If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their
rooms, I will do it. Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I
accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank
him personally?”
</p>
<p>
She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and
silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The clergyman, inwardly cursing the
female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
</p>
<p>
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the acceptance to
come from you. Grant me that, at all events.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.”
</p>
<p>
The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so
low were their chairs.
</p>
<p>
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally. But
any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes
out.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came forth
wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of
Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
</p>
<p>
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
</p>
<p>
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do to keep
polite.”
</p>
<p>
“In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe. Then looking
rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write
up his philosophic diary.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of
heaven had entered the apartment. “Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—”
Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation
developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal
part. Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature. Taking up
Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most
important dates of Florentine History. For she was determined to enjoy herself
on the morrow. Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss
Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said:
</p>
<p>
“I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will superintend the
move.”
</p>
<p>
“How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
</p>
<p>
“Naturally, dear. It is my affair.”
</p>
<p>
“But I would like to help you.”
</p>
<p>
“No, dear.”
</p>
<p>
Charlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her life, but
really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So Lucy felt, or
strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which
wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more
beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
</p>
<p>
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the
largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen
to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not
like it.”
</p>
<p>
Lucy was bewildered.
</p>
<p>
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an
obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in my small
way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a
sort that they will not presume on this.”
</p>
<p>
“Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger
and unsuspected issues.
</p>
<p>
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she
wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she
reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air,
thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in
the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines,
black against the rising moon.
</p>
<p>
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door,
and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and
whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was then that she
saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an
enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.
</p>
<p>
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of
a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious,
portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but
fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the
property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between
two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him. Then she completed her
inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
