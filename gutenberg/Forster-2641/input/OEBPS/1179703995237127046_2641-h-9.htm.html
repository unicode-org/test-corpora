Chapter VIII<br/>
Medieval</h2>
<p>
The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for the
carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun. They were heavy
curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that filtered through
them was subdued and varied. A poet—none was present—might have
quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,” or might have compared the
curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven.
Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was
tempered to the capacities of man.
</p>
<p>
Two pleasant people sat in the room. One—a boy of nineteen—was
studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which
lay upon the piano. From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and
groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human frame fearfully
made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did continually read out to him
what she had written. And continually did she rise from her seat and part the
curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet, and make the remark
that they were still there.
</p>
<p>
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother. “I tell you
I’m getting fairly sick.”
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch,
who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally.
</p>
<p>
Freddy did not move or reply.
</p>
<p>
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s
opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication.
</p>
<p>
“Time they did.”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s his third go, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might have
got this off her chest in Italy. I don’t know how girls manage things, but she
can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t have to say it again now.
Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do feel so uncomfortable.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you indeed, dear? How interesting!”
</p>
<p>
“I feel—never mind.”
</p>
<p>
He returned to his work.
</p>
<p>
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse. I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.’”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, mother, you told me. A jolly good letter.”
</p>
<p>
“I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I
should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it. But—’” She stopped reading, “I
was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all. He has always gone in
for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth. When it comes to the
point, he can’t get on without me.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor me.”
</p>
<p>
“You?”
</p>
<p>
Freddy nodded.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“He asked me for my permission also.”
</p>
<p>
She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!”
</p>
<p>
“Why so?” asked the son and heir. “Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything? What ever did you say?”
</p>
<p>
“I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’”
</p>
<p>
“What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its wording,
had been to the same effect.
</p>
<p>
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
</p>
<p>
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was. Mrs.
Honeychurch went back to the window.
</p>
<p>
“Freddy, you must come. There they still are!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.”
</p>
<p>
“Peeping like that! Can’t I look out of my own window?”
</p>
<p>
But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, “Still
page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves. For a brief space they
were silent. Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long
conversation had never ceased.
</p>
<p>
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.” He gave
a nervous gulp. “Not content with ‘permission’, which I did give—that is
to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with that, he wanted to
know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy. He practically put it like this:
Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he
married her? And he would have an answer—he said it would strengthen his
hand.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.”
</p>
<p>
“I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth. “There! Fly into a stew! I
can’t help it—had to say it. I had to say no. He ought never to have
asked me.”
</p>
<p>
“Ridiculous child!” cried his mother. “You think you’re so holy and truthful,
but really it’s only abominable conceit. Do you suppose that a man like Cecil
would take the slightest notice of anything you say? I hope he boxed your ears.
How dare you say no?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do keep quiet, mother! I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes. I tried to
laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went
away, it may be all right. But I feel my foot’s in it. Oh, do keep quiet,
though, and let a man do some work.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the
subject, “I shall not keep quiet. You know all that has passed between them in
Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and
try to turn him out of my house.”
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit!” he pleaded. “I only let out I didn’t like him. I don’t hate him,
but I don’t like him. What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.”
</p>
<p>
He glanced at the curtains dismally.
</p>
<p>
“Well, <i>I</i> like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “I know his mother; he’s
good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick
the piano! He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well
connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face remained
dissatisfied. She added: “And he has beautiful manners.”
</p>
<p>
“I liked him till just now. I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s first
week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not knowing.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest. “I don’t see how
Mr. Beebe comes in.”
</p>
<p>
“You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he means. He
said: ‘Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I asked him what he
meant. He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I couldn’t make him
say any more, but it set me thinking. Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasn’t
been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.”
</p>
<p>
“You never can, dear. But I can. You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop
Lucy knitting you silk ties.”
</p>
<p>
The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it. But at the
back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust. Cecil praised one too much for
being athletic. Was that it? Cecil made one talk in one’s own way. This tired
one. Was that it? And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another
fellow’s cap. Unaware of his own profundity, Freddy checked himself. He must be
jealous, or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
</p>
<p>
“Will this do?” called his mother. “‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked
my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it.’ Then I
put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write the letter out
again—‘and I have told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in
these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I said that because I
didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned. She goes in for lectures and
improving her mind, and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds, and
the maid’s dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light. She keeps
that flat abominably—”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the country?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t interrupt so foolishly. Where was I? Oh yes—‘Young people must
decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me
everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first.’ No, I’ll
cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing. I’ll stop at ‘because she
tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?”
</p>
<p>
“Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
</p>
<p>
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my
permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I have
told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people
must decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells
me everything. But I do not know—’”
</p>
<p>
“Look out!” cried Freddy.
</p>
<p>
The curtains parted.
</p>
<p>
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation. He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch
habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture. Instinctively he give the
curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down their poles. Light entered.
There was revealed a terrace, such as is owned by many villas with trees each
side of it, and on it a little rustic seat, and two flower-beds. But it was
transfigured by the view beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that
overlooks the Sussex Weald. Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the
edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous
world.
</p>
<p>
Cecil entered.
</p>
<p>
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described. He was
medieval. Like a Gothic statue. Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed
braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little
higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who
guard the portals of a French cathedral. Well educated, well endowed, and not
deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the
modern world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer
vision, worshipped as asceticism. A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a
Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe meant. And
Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same when he failed to
imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her
young acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!”
</p>
<p>
“I promessi sposi,” said he.
</p>
<p>
They stared at him anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him
flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
</p>
<p>
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand that was
yellow with chemicals. They wished that they also knew Italian, for our phrases
of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we
fear to use them on great ones. We are obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to
take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.
</p>
<p>
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand at the
furniture. “This is indeed a joyous day! I feel sure that you will make our
dear Lucy happy.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was
affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most. Why could
she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room; looking very
cross and almost handsome?
</p>
<p>
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
</p>
<p>
Lucy rose from the seat. She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just
as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. Then she saw her brother’s
face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. He said, “Steady on!”
</p>
<p>
“Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
</p>
<p>
Lucy kissed her also.
</p>
<p>
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it?”
Cecil suggested. “And I’d stop here and tell my mother.”
</p>
<p>
“We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you go with Lucy.”
</p>
<p>
They passed into the sunlight. Cecil watched them cross the terrace, and
descend out of sight by the steps. They would descend—he knew their
ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed,
until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the
potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
</p>
<p>
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that had led
to such a happy conclusion.
</p>
<p>
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who
happened to be musical. He could still remember his depression that afternoon
at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue, and
demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s. That day she had seemed a typical
tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel. But Italy worked some
marvel in her. It gave her light, and—which he held more
precious—it gave her shadow. Soon he detected in her a wonderful
reticence. She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love not so
much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us. The things are
assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so
vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by day.
</p>
<p>
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to
passion, at least to a profound uneasiness. Already at Rome he had hinted to
her that they might be suitable for each other. It had touched him greatly that
she had not broken away at the suggestion. Her refusal had been clear and
gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase went—she had been exactly the
same to him as before. Three months later, on the margin of Italy, among the
flower-clad Alps, he had asked her again in bald, traditional language. She
reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed
by fantastic rock; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the
light with immeasurable plains behind her. He walked home with her unashamed,
feeling not at all like a rejected suitor. The things that really mattered were
unshaken.
</p>
<p>
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she had
accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying that she
loved him and would do her best to make him happy. His mother, too, would be
pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a long account.
</p>
<p>
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on it, he
moved to the writing table. There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,” followed by many
erasures. He recoiled without reading any more, and after a little hesitation
sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on his knee.
</p>
<p>
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first,
and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more
distinctive. With that outlook it should have been a successful room, but the
trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he could almost visualize the
motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs. Maple arriving at the door and
depositing this chair, those varnished book-cases, that writing-table. The
table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s letter. He did not want to read that
letter—his temptations never lay in that direction; but he worried about
it none the less. It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his
mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted
to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had
asked their permission. Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in
essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected. “I
represent all that he despises. Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?”
</p>
<p>
The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that Lucy was
of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very definitely—he
ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in;
he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s praise of him in
her letters from Florence.
</p>
<p>
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse. Do you suppose that I shall get it?”
</p>
<p>
“I should say so. Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that
chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Pfui!”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” said Cecil. “I know. I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it.”
</p>
<p>
For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he did not
realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the life that he
desired.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip. Isn’t this news?”
</p>
<p>
“News? I don’t understand you,” said Cecil. “News?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
</p>
<p>
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I am
first in the field. He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!”
</p>
<p>
“Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself. Into what a grotesque
mistake had he fallen! Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would
refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? But his stiffness remained,
and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe
rather a bounder.
</p>
<p>
“Unpardonable question! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have
met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite
the church! I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man languidly. “I
can’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local
Government Board. Perhaps there is no difference, or perhaps those aren’t the
right names. I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the
scenery. It is very remiss of me. Italy and London are the only places where I
don’t feel to exist on sufferance.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert, determined
to shift the subject.
</p>
<p>
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?”
</p>
<p>
“I have no profession,” said Cecil. “It is another example of my decadence. My
attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I am no
trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like. I know I ought to be getting
money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t care a straw about,
but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.”
</p>
<p>
“You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe. “It is a wonderful opportunity, the
possession of leisure.”
</p>
<p>
His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to answering
naturally. He felt, as all who have regular occupation must feel, that others
should have it also.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad that you approve. I daren’t face the healthy person—for
example, Freddy Honeychurch.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?”
</p>
<p>
“Admirable. The sort who has made England what she is.”
</p>
<p>
Cecil wondered at himself. Why, on this day of all others, was he so hopelessly
contrary? He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr. Beebe’s
mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard. Then he flattered the
clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards
philosophy and science.
</p>
<p>
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting tea
before evening service.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose Anne never told them you were here. In this house one is so coached
in the servants the day one arrives. The fault of Anne is that she begs your
pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the chair-legs with her feet.
The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of Mary, but they are very grave.
Shall we look in the garden?”
</p>
<p>
“I know the faults of Mary. She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs.”
</p>
<p>
“The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet
sufficiently small.”
</p>
<p>
They both laughed, and things began to go better.
</p>
<p>
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, he has too many. No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy.
Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.”
</p>
<p>
“She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
</p>
<p>
“I quite agree. At present she has none.”
</p>
<p>
“At present?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not cynical. I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.
Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully, and live so
quietly? I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both. The water-tight
compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle. Then we
shall have her heroically good, heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be
good or bad.”
</p>
<p>
Cecil found his companion interesting.
</p>
<p>
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was not
wonderful, and at Florence. Since I came to Summer Street she has been away.
You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps. Oh, I forgot; of course, you
knew her before. No, she wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept on
expecting that she would be.”
</p>
<p>
“In what way?”
</p>
<p>
Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the
terrace.
</p>
<p>
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next. There was simply the
sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them. I can show you a
beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss
Bartlett holding the string. Picture number two: the string breaks.”
</p>
<p>
The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed
things artistically. At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string
himself.
</p>
<p>
“But the string never broke?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly have
heard Miss Bartlett fall.”
</p>
<p>
“It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
</p>
<p>
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous, contemptible ways
of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He cursed his love of metaphor;
had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
</p>
<p>
“Broken? What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.”
</p>
<p>
The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not
keep out of his voice.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you were intimate with her, or I
should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way. Mr. Vyse, you ought
to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy herself; yes, he was
disappointed.
</p>
<p>
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his
mouth at the corners. Was this the reception his action would get from the
world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man
should; it is almost a test of refinement. But he was sensitive to the
successive particles of it which he encountered.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly. “I fear that Lucy’s
choice does not meet with your approval.”
</p>
<p>
“Not that. But you ought to have stopped me. I know Miss Honeychurch only a
little as time goes. Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so freely with
any one; certainly not with you.”
</p>
<p>
“You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Beebe pulled himself together. Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of placing one
in the most tiresome positions. He was driven to use the prerogatives of his
profession.
</p>
<p>
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet. I foresaw at Florence that her quiet,
uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. I realized dimly enough that
she might take some momentous step. She has taken it. She has learnt—you
will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she has learnt what it is
to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell you, that our earthly life
provides.” It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio. He
did not omit to do so. “She has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still
clerical, it was now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is
profitable to her.”
</p>
<p>
“Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
</p>
<p>
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden.
“Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?”
</p>
<p>
Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. Youth seldom
criticizes the accomplished fact.

“Indeed I have!” he cried. He looked at Lucy. In her presence he could not act
the parson any longer—at all events not without apology. “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m
too shy. I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them, grave and gay, great
and small. I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy
as husband and wife, as father and mother. And now I want my tea.”

“You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted. “How dare you be
serious at Windy Corner?”

He took his tone from her. There was no more heavy beneficence, no more
attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures. None of them
dared or was able to be serious any more.

An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who
speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. Away from it, in the solitude of
their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be critical. But in its
presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious. It
has a strange power, for it compels not only the lips, but the very heart. The
chief parallel to compare one great thing with another—is the power over
us of a temple of some alien creed. Standing outside, we deride or oppose it,
or at the most feel sentimental. Inside, though the saints and gods are not
ours, we become true believers, in case any true believer should be present.

So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they
pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party. If
they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their hypocrisy had every chance
of setting and of becoming true. Anne, putting down each plate as if it were a
wedding present, stimulated them greatly. They could not lag behind that smile
of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door. Mr. Beebe
chirruped. Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the
“Fiasco”—family honoured pun on fiance. Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and
portly, promised well as a mother-in-law. As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the
temple had been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as
earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.
